      "Two years after her shocking decision to resign as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is set to publish a memoir about her eventful time in office",
      "NEW YORK -- Two years after her shocking decision to resign as prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern is set to publish a memoir.",
      "Crown, a division of Penguin Random House, announced Tuesday that Ardern's \u201cA Different Kind of Power\" is scheduled for June 3. Only 37 when elected in 2017, Ardern will reflect on some of the decisions and events that made her known worldwide. She was widely praised for her compassionate response to the 2019 terrorist attacks against two mosques in Christchurch and for her initial handing of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "\u201cSome people thought kindness was sentimental, soft. A bit naive, even. I knew this. But I also knew they were wrong,\" Ardern said in a statement. \"Kindness has a power and strength that almost nothing else on this planet has. I\u2019d seen kindness do extraordinary things \u2014 I\u2019d seen it give people hope, I\u2019d seen it change minds, and transform live. Kindness. This was my guiding principle, and it would be the trait with which I would try to lead, no matter what lay ahead.\u201d",
      "By early 2023, the coronavirus was spreading, and resistance was growing to her zero-tolerance policy of mandates and other restrictions which had helped keep the pandemic out of New Zealand. With her popularity fading, Ardern stunned many supporters by deciding to leave, saying she no longer had \u201cenough in the tank.\u201d In June 2023, she was made a Dame Grand Companion, the second-highest honor in New Zealand, as part of King Charles III\u2019s Birthday Honors. Around the same time, Ardern posted on Instagram that she was working on a book, one more focused on leadership than on \u201cinternal politics.\u201d",
      "Crown is calling her book a \u201cdeeply personal and inspiring memoir\u201d that offers \u201cArdern\u2019s unfiltered journey, from tenacious girl in small-town New Zealand to a trailblazing world leader who became the world\u2019s youngest female head of government, and only the second in history to give birth while in office.\u201d",
      "\u201cArdern changed the world\u2019s expectations of what a global leader can be. With remarkable candor, she shares the pivotal moments that defined her leadership and \u2014 for the first time \u2014 the details behind her decision to step down during her sixth year as Prime Minister,\" Crown announced."

      "LAS VEGAS -- The only suspect ever to be charged in the 1990s killing of rap icon Tupac Shakur in Las Vegas has lost a bid to have his murder case dismissed.",

      "Davis and his lawyer had argued that he never should have been charged with murder because of immunity agreements he says he reached years ago with federal and local authorities. Attorney Carl Arnold said the indictment against his 61-year-old client is an \u201cegregious\u201d violation of his constitutional rights because of a 27-year delay in prosecution.",

      "Prosecutors have said the evidence against Davis is strong, including his own accounts of the 1996 shooting in his tell-all memoir. Davis, an ex-gang leader, is accused of orchestrating the shooting near the Las Vegas Strip that killed Shakur shortly after a brawl at a casino involving Shakur and Davis\u2019 nephew, Orlando \u201cBaby Lane\u201d Anderson.",

      "Shakur died a week later. He was 25.",
      "Anderson, who died in 1998 in a shooting in Compton, had denied involvement in Shakur\u2019s killing. Two other men in the car with Anderson and Davis are also dead."

    "story": [
      "Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Carrie Underwood might not be Beyonc\u00e9 or Garth Brooks in the celebrity superstar ecosystem. But the singer\u2019s participation in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration is nevertheless a sign of the changing tides, where mainstream entertainers, from Nelly to The Village People are more publicly and more enthusiastically associating with the new administration.",
      "Eight years ago, Trump reportedly struggled to enlist stars to be part of the swearing-in and the various glitzy balls that follow. The concurrent protest marches around the nation had more famous entertainers than the swearing-in, which stood in stark contrast to someone like Barack Obama, whose second inaugural ceremony had performances from Beyonc\u00e9, James Taylor and Kelly Clarkson and a series of starry onlookers.",
      "There were always some celebrity Trump supporters, like Kid Rock, Hulk Hogan, Jon Voight, Rosanne Barr, Mike Tyson, Sylvester Stallone and Dennis Rodman, to name a few. But Trump\u2019s victory this time around was decisive and while Hollywood may always skew largely liberal, the slate of names participating in his inauguration weekend events has improved.",
      "Kid Rock, Billy Ray Cyrus, The Village People and Lee Greenwood all performed at a MAGA style rally Sunday. Those performing at inaugural balls include the rapper Nelly, country music band Rascal Flatts, country singer Jason Aldean and singer-songwriter Gavin DeGraw.",
      "\u201cThe people who are coming out and participating directly are still a small subset of the entire universe of what we call celebrity,\u201d said Robert Thompson, a professor of pop culture at Syracuse University. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing a lot more celebrities who are coming out and supporting Trump. There may not be that distinct division that we saw before.\u201d",
      "Even some who have publicly criticized Trump in the past seem to have changed course. One of the highest-profile examples is the rapper Snoop Dogg, who in a 2017 music video pretended to shoot a Trump lookalike, and then this weekend performed at a pre-Inaugural event called The Crypto Ball. When a social media user posted a video of his performance, his name quickly became a trending topic on social media with a fair amount of disbelief and outrage.",
      "There may still be a tinge of stigma, however. Thompson pointed to the statement from The Village People, in which they offered a justification for their involvement, which he likened to an apologia.",
      "Also, Thompson said, \u201cthe idea of being featured in a big national civic ritual perhaps can transcend political identity.\u201d",
      "The participation of people like Underwood is not going to change anyone\u2019s mind about Trump, Thompson said. It could, however, change minds about the artist. On social media, some declared they were going to delete Underwood\u2019s songs from their playlists.",
      "Where Trump once emphasized the otherness of a Hollywood that largely shunned him, he\u2019s now turned his attention back to the entertainment capital as a project to be saved. He named Stallone, Voight and Mel Gibson as his chosen \u201cambassadors\u201d for the mission. Thompson said it sounds like an Onion headline or something on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d That, or a logline for the latest installment in the \u201cExpendables\u201d franchise.",
      "Following the election, celebrity detractors have also been quieter than in 2017, when nationwide marches brought out the likes of Cher, Madonna, Katy Perry, Alicia Keys and Janelle Monae. The People\u2019s March in D.C. on Saturday did not boast about any celebrity participants. At the Golden Globe Awards in early January, Trump\u2019s name was not mentioned on stage -\u2013 a stark contrast to 2017, when Meryl Streep used her lifetime achievement award speech to decry the president-elect before his first term began.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gone through these processes, and it turned out that none of it ever made any bit of difference,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAll of this celebrity talking against Trump and all of the celebrities going for (Joe) Biden and speaking about the future of democracy not only didn\u2019t make any difference toward the outcome of the election, but one could argue that it actually meant that things moved in the other direction.\u201d",
      "On Friday night in D.C., the nonpartisan nonprofit The Creative Coalition brought together some actors to raise money for and celebrate organizations that support military service members and their families.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big fan of things that are nonpartisan, nonpolitical,\u201d said comedian Jeff Ross. \u201cI talk smack for a living and I\u2019m a big believer in free speech. The military protects my right.\u201d",
      "The entertainers stayed largely focused on the event at hand, not the incoming administration, although they did express concern about funding for the National Endowment of the Arts.",
      "\u201cThe NEA has always been in peril, regardless of what administration comes in. But it feels like the incoming administration will probably be more aggressive in cutting down funding for the arts,\u201d said actor Steven Weber. \u201cThey don\u2019t realize that it\u2019s an essential component not only in our education, but in the life blood of this culture.\u201d",
      "One Monday event will have a bit of celebrity counterprogramming \u2014 the Concert for America, not as protest but as fundraiser for wildfire relief which will be held simultaneously in New York and Los Angeles and livestreamed to the world. Participants include Jon Cryer, Lisa Joyner, Conan O\u2019Brien, Julie Bowen, Adam Scott, Wayne Brady and Rosie Perez. In addition to performances and comedy, it will also highlight organizations dedicated to protecting human rights.",
      "Producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson started the event in 2017, also held on Inauguration Day, to raise money for organizations and non-profits they thought would need help over the next four years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only to give people a call to action, but also to give them hope, inspiration and to feel connected,\u201d Jackson said.",
      "They didn\u2019t have trouble recruiting entertainers to participate, Jackson said. The only ones who declined did so because they were working.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t see it as a counter effort,\u201d Rudetsky said. \u201cI see it as a way to get rid of the annoying rhetoric and the hate that\u2019s based on nothing. It\u2019s about unity.\u201d"

      "CHESSY, France -- A cutting-edge nighttime show at Disneyland Paris is heralding a bold new chapter for Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park, as a raft of ambitious developments comes to fruition under a 2 billion euro ($2.05 billion) expansion plan.",
      "The overhaul includes the completed revamp of the luxury Disneyland Hotel, the upcoming renaming and doubling in size of Walt Disney Studios Park, and the much-anticipated arrival of The World of Frozen and a first-of-its-kind The Lion King land \u2014 cementing the resort\u2019s gains after the wilderness years for theme parks during the pandemic.",
      "Disney Tales of Magic was unveiled this month. It's a dazzling 20-minute spectacle blending drones, synchronized fountains, high-definition projections and ultra-bright lasers.",
      "\u201cFor the very first time, not only will we be projecting onto Sleeping Beauty\u2019s Castle, but also Main Street USA,\u201d said Tim Lutkin, artistic director of the production, referring to the park\u2019s main commercial artery lined with boutiques and merchandise.",
      "The show\u2019s standout feature \u2014 ultra-bright lasers \u2014 has been used only once before, at the Paris 2024 Olympics at the Eiffel Tower during the iconic opening ceremony that featured a performance with Celine Dion. The lasers, which travel 23 miles (37 kilometers), deliver extraordinary power while remaining safe near crowds.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Olympics used it first. But we saw it first,\u201d said Dana Harrel, executive entertainment director at Disneyland Paris.",
      "Featuring Disney and Pixar tales brought to life by drone-made 3D figures, synchronized fountains and a 100-piece orchestra, the show is elevated further by the original anthem \u201cLive in Magic.\u201d",
      "Audiences have been awestruck. \u201cIt\u2019s marvelous. We\u2019ve never seen such a beautiful light show,\u201d said Sacha Tellier, a 33-year-old mother visiting with her family. \u201cIt gave me goosebumps,\u201d added Nathan Ruiz, a graphic designer from Madrid. \u201cThe combination of music, lights, and the drones felt like pure magic. I\u2019ve been to Disney before, but this show is on another level.\u201d",
      "The spectacle also reflects Disney\u2019s storytelling evolution. Lutkin noted the shift from classic ballgown tales to modern narratives like \u201cEncanto\u201d and \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d which delves into deeper themes such as anxiety and depression. The latter\u2019s unexpected box office success, Lutkin said, proved that \u201cthe world and its relationship with Disney are ready to embrace more complex stories.\u201d This shift is mirrored in the show\u2019s selection of movies, spanning Disney\u2019s timeless classics and emotionally resonant modern hits.",
      "At the heart of Disneyland Paris\u2019 expansion is the transformation of Walt Disney Studios Park, doubling in size and reimagined as Disney Adventure World. Opening in spring 2025, a new park entrance, World Premiere, will greet visitors with the glamour of a Hollywood film premiere, leading them into immersive themed areas.",
      "\u201cThese projects reflect our commitment to innovation and storytelling,\u201d said Natacha Rafalski, head of Disneyland Paris, adding that they will further strengthen it as Europe\u2019s top tourist destination.",
      "Already Europe\u2019s most-visited theme park and France\u2019s top tourist attraction outdrawing the Louvre, Disneyland Paris welcomed over 10 million visitors in 2023.",
      "The expansion includes two eagerly awaited themed lands. The World of Frozen, debuting in 2026, will transport guests to Arendelle with a central lake hosting water performances and the Frozen Ever After boat ride, alongside themed dining, shopping, and accommodations. Meanwhile, The Lion King land will bring the Pride Lands to life with a log flume cascading from Pride Rock and encounters with beloved characters like Simba and Timon.",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic delivered one the toughest challenges to Disneyland Paris, as with all resort parks around the world, forcing an eight-month closure in 2020 and another in 2021.",
      "But Disney doubled down.",
      "The ongoing \u20ac2 billion expansion is part of a $60 billion global investment announced in September 2023, aiming to redefine Disney parks, cruises and attractions over the next decade.",
      "A centerpiece of the Paris overhaul is the revamped Disneyland Hotel, with suites themed around classic Disney royalty.",
      "Disneyland Paris opened in 1992 under its original name, Euro Disney Resort. Situated just outside Paris in Marne-la-Vall\u00e9e, it marked Disney\u2019s first foray into Europe. However, the park\u2019s early years were fraught with challenges, including cultural missteps, financial struggles and lower-than-expected visitor numbers. Critics in France derided it as an American cultural invasion, dubbing it a \u201ccultural Chernobyl.\u201d",
      "To reverse its fortunes, the park underwent significant rebranding, changing its name to Disneyland Paris in 1994 to emphasize its French location and connection to the capital. Over time, strategic changes, including the addition of new attractions and a shift in marketing, helped the resort recover. It is now a cornerstone of Disney\u2019s global operations."

    "story": [
      "A$AP Rocky is about to go to trial on charges that he fired a gun at a former friend outside a Hollywood hotel in 2021",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A$AP Rocky is at a crossroads. He could soar to new heights of celebrity in 2025, or be brought back to earth quickly by a trial starting Tuesday that could led to his imprisonment for years.",
      "The hip-hop star, and longtime partner to Rihanna, with whom he has two toddler sons, is set to touch the highest levels of high fashion as one of the celebrity chairs of the Met Gala in May along with Pharrell Williams, LeBron James and others.",
      "And his modest acting career will get a major boost from starring alongside Denzel Washington in director Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest,\" planned for a summer release.",
      "But at the Los Angeles trial that's expected to last about three weeks, he is charged with two felony counts of assault with a semiautomatic firearm. He's accused of firing on a former friend on the streets near a Hollywood hotel in 2021. If convicted, he could get up to 24 years in prison.",
      "The 36-year-old has pleaded not guilty, and his attorney says he committed no crime.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re ready to go. It\u2019s been a long time,\u201d defense lawyer Joe Tacopina said after a hearing Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s waiting over Rocky\u2019s head and Rihanna and their family\u2019s heads for a while. We\u2019re anxious to get this thing underway and get this behind him.\u201d",
      "The trial has its roots in high school in New York, when the Harlem-raised Rakim Mayers, now known as A$AP Rocky, met Terell Ephron, also known as A$AP Relli, who will be the trial's most important witness.",
      "Ephron testified at a 2023 preliminary hearing that he brought Rocky into a crew of young creators who called themselves A$AP \u2014 for \u201cAlways Strive and Prosper.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had dreams, pretty much,\u201d Ephron said.",
      "He testified that the members remained close even as Rocky became rich and famous, but the relationships would eventually erode.",
      "The feud came to a head in Hollywood on the night of Nov. 6, 2021, when according to Ephron, Rocky fired at him three or four times, the shots grazing his knuckles.",
      "Ephron went to the police two days later, and brought shell casings he had picked up himself \u2014 both points the defense will seize on.",
      "\u201cYou need nothing more than Mr. Ephron\u2019s testimony by itself,\u201d Deputy District Attorney Paul Przelomiec, the case's lead prosecutor, told a judge at the 2023 hearing,",
      "The trial is full of large personalities, along with two huge names that will loom over the proceedings despite having no direct role: President-elect Donald Trump and Rihanna.",
      "The trial begins the day after the second inauguration of Trump, whom Tacopina represented in the defamation and sexual abuse lawsuit of writer E. Jean Carroll. And Rocky himself became an unlikely cause celebre for then-President Trump during his first term when Trump publicly declared he was trying to get the rapper freed and returned to the U.S. when he was jailed after a brawl in Sweden in 2019.",
      "But Trump has no power over these proceedings, and could not pardon Rocky if he's convicted.",
      "Those anticipating the trial have long been asking whether Rihanna may attend.",
      "\u201cThe mother of his children is she going to be here?\u201d Superior Court Judge Mark Arnold asked the defense at an October hearing. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome to be here whenever she wants I\u2019d just like to know.\u201d",
      "Tacopina has been unable to give a definitive answer, but has said that he does not expect it.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Rihanna and doesn\u2019t want her anywhere near this proceeding,\" he said after Wednesday's hearing. \"But that\u2019s a family decision they\u2019ll make.\u201d",
      "Tacopina said he has no intention of bringing Rihanna's name up at trial, but Arnold suggested he may when screening jurors.",
      "The judge, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy, has an affable but no-nonsense style and dispenses with many court formalities. He said he will keep the juror selection process simple, and a jury should be seated quickly.",
      "In an uncommon move in LA County courts, he will allow cameras in court for nearly the entire trial.",
      "\u201cI believe that the public deserves to see what goes on in the courtroom,\u201d he said.",
      "Tacopina has also represented other hip-hop figures, including Meek Mill and YG. The lawyer who normally practices in New York is gregarious, quick with a joke and always happy to talk to the media, but can be ruthless in cross-examination.",
      "When discussing Ephron's minor injuries at the 2023 hearing, he said, \u201cIt\u2019s a miracle he survived that shooting\u201d and was admonished for his tone.",
      "Deputy District Attorney John Lewin, best known for his successful murder prosecution of real estate scion Robert Durst, was a late addition to the prosecution team. He's also known for his aggressive cross-examination, including a relentless, weeks-long questioning of Durst.",
      "The case against Rocky will largely depend on how credible the jurors find Ephron.",
      "Police officers who searched the Hollywood sidewalk after a report of shots fired found no shell casings. Police recovered no fingerprints from the 9 mm casings Ephron brought them, and no 9 mm pistol was found when a search warrant was served on Rocky.",
      "Surveillance video captured parts of the incident. Prosecutors at the 2023 hearing showed a video still with a man in a hooded sweatshirt whose face is not visible holding what appears to be a gun, along with another image showing the face of the man in the sweatshirt, with no gun visible. A detective testified that investigators established it was Rocky.",
      "Tacopina said he has not decided whether Rocky will testify, which he is legally allowed to avoid.",
      "\u201cHe is eager to tell his story, he would love the opportunity to do so,\u201d the lawyer said Wednesday. \u201cHe is very articulate and very intelligent, he\u2019s a good human being, that would come out if he testifies, but that decision has not been made yet. It depends on how the case goes.\u201d"

      "Even as Tom Brady goes through his first postseason and prepares to call his first Super Bowl as a television analyst in three weeks, rumors about his future continue to be rampant, much to the dismay of Fox Sports.",
      "Fox Sports president of production and operations/executive producer Brad Zager understands the spotlight Brady and the network are under. Still, Zager said Brady is in it for the long haul.",
      "\u201cThe whole group that said he would never be there then turned into, he\u2019s not going to stay there. It\u2019s just a never-ending, merry-go-round of people trying to come up with the next narrative,\u201d Zager said in a phone interview with The Associated Press on Friday. \u201cTom has done nothing but be engaged with us every time he\u2019s asked about broadcasting. When he was retired and getting in, getting ready, he talked about how excited he was for it, that he was 100% and has never wavered on that. So the fact that there are people on that crew that have to read articles and narratives and predictions that Tom isn\u2019t engaged does wear on you,\u201d",
      "Friday\u2019s comments by Zager are the first about Brady by someone from Fox Sports. Brady has not been made available for media interviews this season. He has discussed his first season in the booth during appearances on Colin Cowherd\u2019s show on FS1.",
      "On Thursday, Don Yee, Brady\u2019s agent, told Sports Business Journal that Brady \u201chas had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s really excited about the future with Fox.\u201d Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox in May 2022 while still playing for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He retired after that season and decided in February 2023 to take a year off before moving into the booth.",
      "\u201cTom has had a tremendous amount of fun working with Fox this year, and he\u2019s excited about the future with Fox and his growth on their team,\u201d Yee said. \u201cAnd this year was the first year of a long relationship.\u201d",
      "Yee did not return an email or text message by The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Fox Sports has tried to weather the rumors and criticism surrounding Brady\u2019s future and his dual roles as the analyst on its NFL crew and being a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders.",
      "Everything has come to a head this week with Brady and Kevin Burkhardt calling Saturday night\u2019s NFC divisional round game in Detroit between the Lions and the Washington Commanders.",
      "Lions offensive coordinator Ben Johnson and defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn are candidates for the Raiders' head coach opening. Brady is involved in the franchise\u2019s coach and general manager selection.",
      "Brady cannot participate in Fox\u2019s production meetings with teams \u2014 either in person or via Zoom \u2014 watch practices, or step foot in a team\u2019s training complex. The only team complex Brady is allowed in is the Raiders.",
      "The league put those parameters in place going into the season after Brady purchased a 5% stake in the Raiders in May 2023. NFL owners approved the purchase last October.",
      "Zager said any inferences about a potential conflict of interest between Brady calling the game and being part of the Raiders\u2019 decision-making process are unfounded.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s questioning his professionalism and integrity. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Zager said.",
      "Any questions Brady would have for the coordinators or head coach Dan Campbell could be asked by Burkhardt or a member of the Fox crew in the production meetings. However, Brady receives the same film and statistical information as everyone else on the crew.",
      "\u201cAnytime you\u2019re around crew members and doing something as a crew, that\u2019s a good thing for the crew. So, we\u2019ve have to overcome that. You\u2019re not going to have that time to bond,\u201d Zager said. \u201cBut when it comes to analyzing the game and learning information, what is available at the fingertips of the average fan now is probably light years ahead of what was available even to the broadcast crew 15-20 years ago. Not being in the meetings has not stopped him from growing as an analyst throughout the season.\u201d",
      "Brady\u2019s analysis of teams and officiating is subject to more scrutiny by the league because of his stake in the Raiders, but it would have to be egregiously critical or call into question the integrity of a team or referee.",
      "Zager pointed out that Brady has been critical of play calls or strategy, just like any analyst is expected to do.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been awesome to watch Tom jump into this, having no broadcast experience, and calling the NFL\u2019s biggest games. He continues to find his rhythm and those spots where he can really shine during a game,\u201d Zager said. \u201cI think he\u2019s hitting a great stride as we head to the postseason in our biggest games. And I\u2019m looking forward to these next three games, which are three biggest games, and what he\u2019s going to add to the broadcast.\u201d",
      "Attention and rumors about Fox\u2019s top NFL crew are nothing new. Troy Aikman and Joe Buck\u2019s future during the 2021 season was constant fodder before both moved to ESPN\u2019s \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d When Brady would join Fox then dominated the 2022 and \u201923 seasons. Brady, though, did take a lot of pressure off the network before Super Bowl 57 in 2023 when he said early in the week leading up to the game that he wouldn\u2019t be joining Fox in 2023, which allowed Greg Olsen to answer questions about the game instead of his future and not be a one-year, lame duck analyst on a top network team."

      "\u201cWe have here perhaps the largest thermal complex in a private house in Pompeii,\u201d said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Pompeii archaeological park. \u201cThe members of the ruling class of Pompeii set up enormous spaces in their homes to host banquets.",

      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\u201cShe enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\u201d the family said. \u201cWe are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",

      "The suit filed in federal court in New York by Baldoni and production company Wayfarer Studios seeks at least $400 million for damages that include lost future income. It alleges that Lively and Reynolds hijacked the production and marketing of \u201cIt Ends With Us\" and manipulated media to smear Baldoni and others on the production with false allegations of sexual and other harassment.",
      "\u201cThis is a case about two of the most powerful stars in the world deploying their enormous power to steal an entire film right out of the hands of its director and production studio,\u201d the suit says. \u201cThen, when Lively and Reynolds\u2019 efforts failed to win them the acclaim they believed they so richly deserved, they turned their fury on their chosen scapegoat.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit comes about two weeks after Lively sued Baldoni and several others tied to the film, alleging they retaliated against her for coming forward about her treatment on the set. That lawsuit came just hours after Baldoni sued the New York Times for libel, alleging the paper worked with Lively to smear him.",
      "An email sent to publicist Leslie Sloane \u2014 who is also named as a defendant \u2014 seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "The Times said it stood by its reporting and planned to \u201cvigorously defend\u201d against the allegations.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d based on the bestselling 2016 novel by Colleen Hoover, was released in August and exceeded box office expectations with a $50 million debut. It begins as a standard romantic drama before taking a dark turn into domestic violence.",
      "The film's release was shrouded by speculation over discord between co-stars Lively and Baldoni, and the fallout has made make major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",
      "\u201cHeartbreakingly, a film that Baldoni envisioned years ago would honor the survivors of domestic violence by telling their story, with the lofty goal of making a positive impact in the world, has now been overshadowed beyond recognition solely as a result of Lively\u2019s actions and cruelty,\u201d the lawsuit says.",
      "Allegations from Lively that she was shown pornography and subjected to unwanted discussions about it from Baldoni and a producer were utterly false, the suit alleges.",
      "\u201cLively was so close and comfortable with Baldoni that she freely breast-fed in front of him during meetings,\u201d the suit says.",
      "She would later take moments like these that she encouraged and recast them as sexual harassment and misconduct from Baldoni, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "It also says that counter to Lively's allegations, every request she made for an intimacy coordinator to help with sensitive scenes on the film was honored. It focuses especially on a a birthing scene, saying Lively's contention that she was \u201cmostly nude\u201d with non-essential people present including the film's financier were \"knowingly false.\"",
      "\u201cLively was wearing black briefs and a pregnancy suit that covered her midsection, and her top was covered by a hospital gown,\u201d the suit says.",
      "Baldoni says that at another point during the production, because he has back problems, he privately and politely asked Lively her weight so that he could work with his personal trainer to be able to safely lift her in the film.",
      "Reynolds later \u201cswore at Baldoni and accused him of fat-shaming his wife,\" the suit says.",
      "\u201cIn fact, Lively had earlier expressed insecurity about her postpartum figure, and Baldoni made every attempt to genuinely reassure her,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Baldoni took a backseat in promoting the film while Lively took center stage along with Reynolds, who was on the press circuit for \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d at the same time.",
      "Baldoni says the \u201ctone-deaf\u201d and \u201cdisastrous\u201d moves from Lively that led to her attempt at a counter-narrative included naming a drink at the post-premiere party \u201cRyle You Wait,\u201d after the character who engages in domestic violence.",
      "The backlash against Baldoni led to his being dropped by his agency WME, which also represents both Lively and Reynolds,",
      "The suit alleges Reynolds was responsible for this, saying that he approached a WME executive at the \u201cDeadpool & Wolverine\u201d premiere and \u201cexpressed his deep disdain for Baldoni, suggesting the agency was working with a \u2018sexual predator.\u2019\u201d",
      "Prior to \u201cIt Ends With Us,\u201d Baldoni starred in the TV comedy \u201cJane the Virgin,\u201d directed the 2019 film \u201cFive Feet Apart,\u201d and wrote \u201cMan Enough,\u201d a book pushing back against traditional notions of masculinity.",
      "\u201cLively knew full well that making those allegations would be a career death sentence for Plaintiffs, especially given that Baldoni has lived his private and public life as an impassioned advocate for gender equality and healthy masculinity,\u201d his lawsuit says.",
      "Lively came to fame through the 2005 film \u201cThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants,\u201d and bolstered her stardom on the TV series \u201cGossip Girl\u201d from 2007 to 2012. She has since starred in films including \u201cThe Town\u201d and \u201cThe Shallows.\u201d",
      "Baldoni's lawsuit says Lively's cruelty even extended to having her suit served on Baldoni and his co-defendants during the onset of the wildfires that have ravaged the Los Angeles area, saying that on a day when they were \"gathering their kids and pets, preparing 'go bags' and monitoring evacuation orders while fearing for their homes, Lively\u2014from the safety of her penthouse in New York\u2014 deployed process servers.\u201d",
      "The suit against Baldoni and other defendants was filed on Dec. 31, but the serving of papers as required by law came the following week."

      "Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich",
      "NEW YORK -- Nearly all of the new film \u201cSeptember 5\u201d takes place in the darkened, smokey control room from which ABC Sports broadcast the hostage crisis of the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich.",
      "All around the room is a buzzing clutter of period analog equipment. The video monitors act like windows, offering perspectives of the drama just outside: the taking of Israeli Olympic team members by the Palestinian militant group Black September.",
      "Inside the control room are the sports producers who were thrown into covering one of the first breaking news events televised worldwide. Some 900 million viewers are estimated to have watched.",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d a taut procedural recently nominated for best film, drama, by the Golden Globes, suggests this was a seminal moment in media history. Inside the control room, a handful of producers reckon in real time with questions that still pervade today\u2019s journalism: What\u2019s appropriate to show? Are we informing or sensationalizing? Do we have our facts straight?",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is show this moment where media forever changed,\u201d says John Magaro, who stars as producer Geoffrey Mason. \u201cThese people didn\u2019t know what they were unlocking, what they were letting out of a Pandora\u2019s Box. They were just trying to tell the story. But in doing that, they opened up a road to more sensationalism in journalism.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeptember 5,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, has been hailed as an expertly crafted pressure cooker of journalism ethics. While the Munich Olympics terrorist attack has been the subject of several previous films, including Steven Spielberg\u2019s \u201cMunich\u201d (2005) and the 1999 documentary \u201cOne Day in September,\u201d \u201cSeptember 5\u201d \u2013 a kind of combination of \u201cSpotlight\u201d and \u201cRear Window\u201d \u2013 keeps its focus entirely on the broadcast that culminated in Jim McKay\u2019s much-remembered announcement of the hostages' tragic end: \u201cThey\u2019re all gone.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a group of experienced or trained news journalists reporting on this crisis,\u201d says Swiss director Tim Fehlbaum, who wrote the screenplay with Moritz Binder. \u201cIt was a bunch of sports TV people. That offered an interesting opportunity to confront them with these questions, in an almost innocent way.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d what was on TV screens in 1972, like McKay\u2019s report, is likewise what's seen in the movie. Real archival footage is a co-star. But everyone inside the studio is played by a sterling ensemble, including Peter Sarsgaard (a veteran of another striking journalism movie, 2003\u2019s \u201cShattered Glass\u201d ) as \u201cWide World of Sports\u201d creator Roone Arledge and Ben Chaplin as producer Marvin Bader.",
      "But if there\u2019s a central figure in \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d it\u2019s Mason, a then-young ABC Sports producer thrown into covering one of the biggest news stories of the decade. It was likewise a leading-man chance for Magaro, the talented 41-year-old Ohio native whose sensitive performances in films like \u201cFirst Cow\u201d and \u201cPast Lives\u201d have made him a standout character actor.",
      "\u201cIn a lot of ways, that\u2019s what was the most intriguing part of the script for me,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cI don\u2019t know how you can be an actor without feeling this competitive nature and need to seize opportunities when they\u2019re presented because there\u2019s not a lot them. I think it was the same for Geoff Mason at the time.\u201d",
      "Magaro\u2019s first time on a movie set was as an extra in \u201cMunich.\u201d Since then, though, he\u2019s grown as an actor through an ethic of hard work that he traces back to his family\u2019s immigrant, working-class roots.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m a 5-7 nebbishy white kid from Cleveland, Ohio,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cThis kind of journey doesn\u2019t happen to many of us. It\u2019s been a hard road at times and it\u2019s been a continuous climb. I never expected to get this far but I always had a drive in me to get better as an actor.\u201d",
      "In \u201cSeptember 5,\u201d Fehlbaum put a premium on authenticity. From museums and collectors he gathered the then-cutting edge video technology of the early 1970s and brought it up to working order. Walking onto the set, which with near-accuracy recreated the ABC control room, was \u201clike stepping onto a submarine everyday,\u201d says Magaro. (The U-boat-set 1981 film \u201cDas Boot\u201d was, appropriately, as inspiration for Fehlbaum.)",
      "The actors leaned into the same ethos. Magaro depended considerably on the anecdotes and advice of Mason who went on to have a decorated, decades-long career in television. With his help, Magaro sat in on CBS\u2019s Sunday NFL control room and games at Madison Square Garden to soak up the fast-paced atmosphere.",
      "\u201cGeoff told me that day there was no chance to think. Their singular goal was to stay on the air to keep the story going, to do their job as sports broadcasters,\u201d Magaro says. \u201cOnce the clock starts ticking, there\u2019s no chance to think.\u201d",
      "In chronicling the minute-by-minute drama of covering the Munich terrorist attack, \u201cSeptember 5\u201d sidesteps the political repercussions of one the most infamous chapters of Israeli-Palestinian relations. The film was in post-production when Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023. It first debuted at film festivals last fall while the Israeli war in Gaza continued.",
      "On Wednesday, Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire, raising hopes that the 15-month conflict could be nearing an end. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, said the agreement was still not complete.",
      "Yet \u201cSeptember 5\" strives to keep its focus on media, not politics.",
      "\u201cHas anything ever really changed? That conflict has been going on since 1948 when Israel was created,\u201d says Magaro. \u201cIt\u2019s a question, no matter what side you\u2019re on, you can ask yourself, even with the current situation: Is the media covering this the best way possible?\u201d",
      "Earlier foundational moments in the history of live news broadcasting stretch back to April 1949, when 3-year-old Kathy Fiscus fell down an abandoned well in San Marino, California. KTLA in Los Angeles televised more than 27 hours of the rescue effort live.",
      "Today's media landscape, populated by social media and digital platforms that are often riddled with misinformation in some ways makes the ethical questions wrestled over in \u201cSeptember 5\u201d seem almost quaint. But for Fehlbaum, it's less about what's changed than what hasn't.",
      "\u201cWhat I\u2019ve observed is that while technology changes a lot, the bigger ethical or moral questions are still the same,\u201d Fehlbaum says. \"For both those reporting on a crisis and us consuming news.\u201d"

      "Comedian and host Conan O\u2019Brien is the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Comedian and host Conan O'Brien was named the newest recipient of the Mark Twain Prize for lifetime achievement in comedy on Thursday.",
      "O'Brien, 61, has carved out an improbable decadeslong career arc, moving from goofy television interloper to comedic elder statesman. Along the way, he survived one of the most public failures in the history of television on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d \u2014 only to launch a successful, and sustained, next act.",
      "His travel series \u201cConan O'Brien Must Go\u201d sparked popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. In March, O'Brien will host the Academy Awards three weeks before his own Mark Twain ceremony in Washington.",
      "Deborah Rutter, president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, in a statement called O'Brien \u201ca master of invention and reinvention, consistently pushing the envelope in search of new comedic heights.\"",
      "O\u2019Brien offered his own tongue-in-cheek assessment, saying in the Kennedy Center statement that he would be \u201cthe first winner of the Mark Twain Prize recognized not for humor, but for my work as a riverboat pilot.\u201d He will be honored on March 23 in a special ceremony in which he will receive a bronze bust of Twain, the iconic American writer and satirist whose real name was Samuel Clemens.",
      "Mark Twain recipients are honored with a night of testimonials and video tributes, often featuring previous award winners. The ceremony will stream on Netflix at a later date yet to be announced.",
      "O'Brien leaped into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993, when he was chosen to replace the legendary David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "Bringing a skittish, awkward energy that contrasted with Letterman's deadpan persona, O'Brien constantly made fun of his own gangly appearance and inappropriateness for the job. He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host.",
      "In 2009, O'Brien's career and persona took a turn. He became the man who publicly gained and lost his dream job while America watched.",
      "O'Brien was tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d despite public warnings from his own guests that Leno wasn't ready to cede the throne. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "The aftermath split the comedy world, with Leno cast as the villain and O'Brien as the victim who was set up to fail.",
      "In an emotional goodbye on his final \u201cTonight Show,\u201d O'Brien described himself as lucky and refused to sound bitter.",
      "\u201cEvery comedian dreams of hosting 'The Tonight Show,' and for seven months I got to do it,\" he said. \"I did it my way with people I love, and I don't regret one second.\u201d",
      "He ended with a sort of generational rallying cry.",
      "\u201cAll I ask is this one thing, particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical,\u201d O'Brien said, his voice cracking. \u201cNobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get, but if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen.\u201d",
      "O'Brien reemerged later in 2010 with a new talk show on the cable station TBS. Despite the channel's lower profile, the show ran for 11 years while he launched parallel ventures like the podcast \u201cConan O'Brien Needs a Friend\u201d and the travel show \u201cConan Without Borders,\u201d a precursor to his current show.",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett and Dave Chappelle. Bill Cosby, the 2009 recipient, had his Mark Twain Prize rescinded in 2019 amid multiple allegations of sexual assault."

      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

      "Dr. Kevin Foster, the director of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix, said flying particles and debris from the explosion inflicted traumatic injuries.",
      "\u201cIn addition to the thermal injury that comes from the heat and the flame and the fire, we also have an explosive nature to this with particles moving at very high speeds striking patients,\u201d Foster said at a news conference from Phoenix that was streamed online.",
      "The blast killed four people, including a 3-year-old boy, and injured about 20 others. The U.S. military flew six of the wounded to Arizona on Jan. 4 because Hawaii\u2019s lone burn unit didn't have enough capacity to care for all the victims.",
      "Medical staff hadn't realized the magnitude of the injuries from the flying particles until the patients had surgery. But Foster said this was to be expected.",
      "\u201cYou really have to get into the operating room and start operating on these people to really understand that. So it\u2019s not surprising that nobody picked up on this,\u201d Foster said.",
      "The traumatic injuries resulted in some unusual infections but Foster said this didn\u2019t catch caregivers off guard. Doctors at the center have seen these types of injuries in fireworks patients before and infections in burn patients are almost unavoidable, he said.",
      "The blast happened at a three-story home with a bottom-level carport in a Honolulu residential neighborhood.",
      "Hawaii Gov. Josh Green earlier this week proposed a range of new penalties to crack down on those who flout the state\u2019s fireworks laws. The state Department of Law Enforcement has asked the Legislature for $5.2 million to hire eight people and expand a forensic lab to counter rampant smuggling of illegal fireworks."

      "The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said.",
      "After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it\u2019s colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue.",
      "\u201cThis would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,\u201d said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. \u201cIt\u2019s pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that\u2019s consistent with these stretches because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.\u201d",
      "It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around 22 degrees (minus-6 Celsius) at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to 7 degrees (minus-14 Celsius). Barack Obama 2009 swearing-in was 28 degrees (minus-2 Celsius).",
      "But that's not all because the wind is forecast to be 30 to 35 mph (48 to 56 kph).",
      "\u201cThe wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,\u201d the NWS' Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.\u201d",
      "Washington could see single digits later and on Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low broken in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs.",
      "About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said.",
      "\"The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,\" Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around 7 degrees (minus-14 degrees Celsius), he said.",
      "Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh will get the most brutal cold compared to their normal temperatures.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,\u201d Maue said.",
      "Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said.",
      "Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it\u2019s the opposite. Each day\u2019s computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said.",
      "There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said \u2014 what Maue called a dry cold.",
      "As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said.",
      "These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe.",
      "Those also trigger changes in the jet stream \u2014 the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east \u2014 that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster.",
      "On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said.",
      "On the west side, in southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said.",
      "Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans.",
      "And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.",

      "Various European leaders reacted to President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Paris Agreement saying that they will stick to the landmark Paris climate agreement even though the United States has withdrawn from it",
      "DAVOS, Switzerland -- As expected, day two of the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland witnessed strong responses to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, with European leaders stating in no uncertain terms that they will hold fort and remain a part of the global climate pact.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said on Tuesday: \u201cEurope will stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\u201d She insisted that the 27-nation bloc will stick to the landmark Paris climate accord. \u201cThe Paris Agreement continues to be the best hope for all humanity,\u201d she said.",
      "The Paris accord is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) or, failing that, keeping temperatures at least well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels.",
      "Minutes before von der Leyen spoke, climate activists sprung a surprise and rare action inside the normally ultra-secure venue, unfurling a banner that read: \u201cTax the super-rich! Fund a just and green future.\u201d",
      "United Nation's climate chief, Simon Stiell speaking at a panel looking ahead to this year's upcoming climate talks in Brazil said the \u201cdoor remains open\u201d for the United States. \u201cThe world is undergoing an energy transition that is unstoppable. Last year alone, over $2 trillion was invested in the transition (to clean energy). And that compares to one trillion in fossil fuels,\u201d he said",
      "Stiell said that there is \u201ccrisis fatigue\u201d in the world now. \u201cThe poly crisis environment that we\u2019ve been in for the last few years, climate has been pushed down the crisis priority list,\u201d he said. However, he said that regardless of political changes, \u201cthe science behind climate hasn\u2019t changed. The impacts actually have changed in that they\u2019re simply getting worse and worse.\u201d",
      "In a session at Davos that looked at Europe\u2019s transition to clean energy, Alexander De Croo, Belgium\u2019s prime minister responded to Trump\u2019s decision saying, \u201cI mean, the world is full of uncertainty after yesterday even more, and maybe tomorrow there might be even more uncertainty. Let\u2019s please, as Europeans within the European Union, not add to the uncertainty by creating ambiguity on our goals.\u201d",
      "Business leaders at Davos chimed with the benefits of sticking to a global climate mandate. Jesper Brodin, chief executive officer of global furniture company, IKEA said: \"For us, who have been on the bumpy train ride for a couple of years, we are discovering year by year how we actually not only can succeed to deliver to the Paris Agreement but actually how it benefits, business.\u201d",
      "Climate scientists and activists from the Global South were more critical of the U.S.'s withdrawal from the climate pact. \u201cGlobally, Trump's decision undermines the collective fight against climate change at a time when unity and urgency are more critical than ever. The most tragic consequences, however, will be felt in developing countries,\u201d said New Delhi-based Harjeet Singh, of the Fossil Fuels Non Proliferation Treaty These vulnerable nations and communities, which have contributed the least to global emissions, will bear the brunt of intensifying floods, rising seas, and crippling droughts.\u201d",

      "South Korea\u2019s impeached president has denied that he ordered the military to drag lawmakers out of the National Assembly to prevent them from voting to reject his martial law decree last month, as he appeared for the first time before the Constitutiona...",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s impeached president denied Tuesday that he ordered the military to drag lawmakers out of the National Assembly to prevent them from voting to reject his martial law decree last month, as he appeared for the first time before the Constitutional Court that will determine his fate.",
      "Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s presence at the court was his first public appearance since becoming South Korea\u2019s first sitting president to be detained over his short-lived declaration of martial law, which plunged the country into political turmoil.",
      "After abruptly imposing martial law on Dec. 3, Yoon sent troops and police officers to encircle the National Assembly, but enough lawmakers managed to enter to vote unanimously to reject his decree, forcing Yoon\u2019s Cabinet to lift the measure early the following morning.",
      "Yoon, a conservative, has since argued that his dispatch of troops was not meant to block the assembly but instead was a warning to the main liberal opposition Democratic Party, which has used its legislature majority to obstruct Yoon's agenda, undermine his budget bill and impeach some of his top officials. In his announcement of martial law, Yoon called the assembly \u201ca den of criminals\u201d that was bogging down government affairs, and vowed to eliminate \u201cshameless North Korea followers and anti-state forces.\u201d",
      "The commanders of military units sent to the assembly have disagreed with Yoon\u2019s stance. Kwak Jong-keun, commander of a special forces unit, told an assembly hearing that Yoon had called him directly and asked that his troops \u201cquickly destroy the door and drag out the lawmakers who are inside.\u201d Kwak said he didn\u2019t carry out the order.",
      "Asked by acting Constitutional Court chief justice Moon Hyungbae whether he ordered the commanders to pull out the lawmakers, Yoon replied that he didn\u2019t do so.",
      "Yoon said the lawmakers could have gathered somewhere later to overturn the decree. He also argued that there would have been a popular backlash if he had tried to physically prevent an assembly vote.",
      "\u201cIf I had obstructed (the vote), I think I wouldn't have been able to handle the consequences,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "Asked by Moon about reports that he gave a memo on establishing an emergency legislative body to a top official before imposing martial law, Yoon said he didn\u2019t do so. Whether Yoon plotted to launch such a body would help explain his true intentions for martial law.",
      "The assembly impeached Yoon on Dec. 14, suspending his presidential powers. The Constitutional Court has until June to determine whether to formally dismiss him as president or reinstate him. Observers say a court ruling is expected to come sooner.",
      "Separately, law enforcement authorities are investigating whether Yoon and others committed rebellion, abuse of power and other crimes in connection with the martial law decree. By law, the leader of a rebellion can face life in prison or the death penalty.",
      "Yoon earlier ignored several requests to appear for questioning and remained in his presidential residence in Seoul, though his defense minister, police chief and several top military commanders had already been arrested over their roles in the enforcement of martial law. He was eventually detained on Jan. 15 when authorities mobilized hundreds of police and investigators near his residence.",
      "While South Korean presidents have wide-ranging immunity from prosecution while in office, the protection does not extend to allegations of rebellion or treason.",
      "Yoon\u2019s martial law decree has rattled South Korea\u2019s diplomatic activities and financial markets and hurt its international image as a vibrant democracy. Yoon\u2019s subsequent defiance and the opposition\u2019s push to oust him have also intensified South Korea\u2019s already-serious internal divide.",
      "After a Seoul district court on Sunday approved a formal arrest warrant to extend Yoon's detainment, dozens of his supporters stormed the court building, destroying windows, doors and other property. They also attacked police officers with bricks, steel pipes and other objects. The violence left 17 police officers injured, and police said they detained 46 protesters.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Keir Starmer says the killing of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class must lead to \u201cfundamental change\u201d in how the British state protects citizens",
      "LONDON -- Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Tuesday that the killing of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class must lead to \u201cfundamental change\u201d in how the British state protects citizens and a reckoning with new threats from violent individuals that test the traditional definition of terrorism.",
      "Starmer said the government must also answer \u201ctough questions\u201d about how authorities failed to stop a violence-obsessed teenager before he stabbed three young girls to death in the seaside town of Southport in July.",
      "In a televised statement, the prime minister said that a public inquiry would tackle failings in the case of Axel Rudakubana, who injured another eight children, their instructor and a passer-by.",
      "\u201cThe tragedy of the Southport killings must be a line in the sand for Britain,\u201d Starmer said.",
      "Rudakubana, 18, unexpectedly changed his pleas to guilty on Monday, the first day of his trial at Liverpool Crown Court. He is due to be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "His guilty plea means that details that had been withheld from the public to try to ensure a fair trial can now be reported. They include the fact that Rudakubana was referred three times to the government\u2019s anti-extremism program, Prevent, when he was 13 and 14, and was in contact with multiple state agencies \u2014 all of whom failed to spot the danger he posed.",
      "The attack occurred on the first day of summer vacation when two dozen little girls were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher.",
      "He killed Alice Da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6. Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and John Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened.",
      "The killings in the northwest England town triggered days of anti-immigrant violence across the country after far-right activists seized on incorrect reports that the attacker was an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in the U.K.",
      "Rudakubana was born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents.",
      "Critics have accused Starmer\u2019s government of withholding information about the suspect in the aftermath of the attack. Starmer said there was no conspiracy of silence, just a desire to see justice done.",
      "\u201cThe only losers if the details had been disclosed would have been the victims and the families because it ran the risk the trial would have collapsed,\u201d he said.",
      "Police and prosecutors also face questions about why the case was not labeled terrorism, despite Rudakubana facing charges of possessing an al-Qaida manual and the poison ricin alongside charges of murder and attempted murder.",
      "Starmer said the case showed that \u201cterrorism has changed\u201d and the law might need to be changed to deal with \u201ca new threat \u2026 (from) acts of extreme violence carried out by loners, misfits, young men in their bedrooms.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is a new threat, it\u2019s not what we would have usually thought of as terrorism when definitions were drawn up when guidelines were put in place, when the framework was put in place and we have to recognize that here today,\" he said.",
      "\u201cIt's clearly extreme violence. It's clearly intended to terrorize.\"",

      "TOKYO -- Dozens of major Japanese companies have pulled their commercials on Fuji Television amid allegations company officials tried to cover up a sex scandal involving one of the country\u2019s most famous TV hosts.",
      "The scandal centers on Masahiro Nakai, a former member of the super popular male band SMAP and now a popular host at Fuji and other Japanese networks. Nakai has been linked by local media to an alleged sexual assault at a party reportedly arranged by one of Fuji TV's staff.",
      "After the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement between Nakai and a woman over the alleged sexual assault at a 2023 dinner party, the former SMAP star issued a statement acknowledging a settlement over \u201ca trouble,\u201d but he denied using any violence.",
      "News of the scandal did not immediately trigger a flood of pullouts by sponsors.

      "Major sponsors such as automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.; cosmetics maker Shiseido; retailer Seven & I Holding Co. and life insurer Meiji Yasuda announced they were pulling ads from Fuji TV. Local media reports said more than 50 companies had done the same.",
      "Nissan said Tuesday that it had pulled its Fuji TV adds and was watching developments before deciding on further steps.",
      "During Friday's news conference, Fuji TV President Koichi Minato apologized and acknowledged his company had not disclosed the problem despite becoming aware of it about six months before the Shukan Bunshun report. Minato said Fuji TV would investigate the case but also said he believed his employees had not done anything wrong.",
      "Fuji TV apologized for causing trouble to many advertisers and agencies but declined to disclose details.",

      "The deal came as Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, handed power over to returning President Donald Trump. The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the \u201cnormalization\u201d of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize their rule.",

      "\u201cWe live together. We bought a house. We bought a car. But we cannot share these things together like a married couple. When this is happening, we feel that it's our rights that we need to secure as quickly as possible,\u201d she said.",
      "The marriage equality bill, which sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate, amended the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words \u201cmen and women\u201d and \u201chusband and wife\u201d to \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201cmarriage partners.\u201d It would open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBTQ+ couples.",
      "Sunma, who owns a travel agency, said that she had realized how crucial being legally married was when Danaya was hospitalized with dengue fever, as they don't live close to her parents.",
      "\u201cThe doctors asked me who I was, and I said I was the girlfriend, and they were like, \u2018so what\u2019?' I couldn\u2019t make any decision until her condition became quite serious,\u201d she said. \u201cI was so upset, like, if I had lost her \u2026 there would be nothing that could\u2019ve made up for it. So, I think this is very important for both of us.\u201d",
      "Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity, but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values. Members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life, although they note that things have improved greatly in recent years.",
      "The government led by the Pheu Thai party made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok\u2019s busiest commercial districts.",
      "Last week, Government House invited dozens of LGBTQ+ couples and activists for a photo op and a meeting with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and several high ranking officials to celebrate the law coming into effect, making Thailand the first in Southeast Asia and the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to legalize same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cIt is almost like a dream, but it\u2019s not. So, congratulations to all,\u201d Paetongtarn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that the world notice us, and know that in this small country we have this kind of thought. We have this kind of support for our people. So, we all should be proud.\u201d",
      "The organizers of Bangkok Pride have collaborated with relevant government agencies to hold a grand celebration in central Bangkok and facilitate couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day. They said that more than 300 couples have registered to officially tie the knot on Thursday at the event.",
      "\u201c(The law) is about returning our dignity, and confirming that we also have dignity as a human being,\u201d said Ann \u201cWaaddao\u201d Chumaporn, a gender equality activist and the lead organizer of Bangkok Pride. \u201cThat day is going to be meaningful to all the couples that have gone through this journey together. I\u2019d like to thank everyone, every love, that has faithfully struggled so that today would finally happen.\u201d",
      "The government and state agencies in Thailand are historically traditional in outlook. To prepare them for change, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said that it has organized workshops for staff of all Bangkok district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration. They included lectures raising awareness about gender diversity and guidance on how to properly communicate with those who come for the service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a missing piece of the jigsaw,\u201d Bangkok Deputy Gov. Sanon Wangsrangboon said at one of the workshops earlier this month. \u201cSociety is ready. The law is getting ready. But the last piece of the jigsaw is the understanding from officials.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged there that would be problems in the beginning, but said that he hoped they would gradually improve over time.",
      "After they register their marriage, Sunma said that she\u2019s looking forward to having a \u201creal marriage celebration\u201d with her and Danaya\u2019s families.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the two of us that are happy, but both of our families feel it is a big deal, and it is what everyone has been waiting for. Everyone said they are waiting for Jan. 23,\u201d she said."

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro says he will declare an emergency over the guerrilla attacks in the northeast that have killed dozens of people and forced thousands to flee",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Monday that he will declare a state of emergency over the guerrilla attacks in the northeast that have killed dozens of people and forced thousands to flee their homes.",
      "In a message on X, Petro said that he will \u201cdeclare a state of internal commotion,\" a measure that enables the executive branch to pass certain kinds of legislation without congressional approval for three months. The measure will go into effect after a decree is signed by the president and his Cabinet, but it can also be invalidated by Colombia's constitutional court.",
      "Internal commotion decrees were used in the early 2000s by the administration of then-President \u00c1lvaro Uribe to increase financing for the military through a special war tax. According to Colombia's constitution, this emergency measure cannot be used to suspend congress or eliminate civil rights. \u201cI hope the judicial system supports us,\u201d Petro wrote on X.",
      "Earlier on Monday Petro had warned that his nation\u2019s military will take offensive actions against the National Liberation Army after the rebels, known as the ELN, unleashed a wave of attacks in Colombia's Catatumbo region, in which at least 80 people have been killed.",
      "\u201cThe ELN has chosen the path of war, and that\u2019s what they will get,\u201d Petro wrote in a message on X, in which he accused the rebels of turning into a drug trafficking group and compared their methods to those of Pablo Escobar, the infamous cartel leader who bombed government buildings and murdered his enemies by hiring hundreds of hitmen.",
      "Petro, who was a member of a guerrilla group during his youth, initiated peace talks with the ELN in 2022, after promising in his presidential campaign that he could get the rebels to demobilize within three months of taking office.",
      "But talks have stalled over multiple disagreements about how the rebels would disarm and the kinds of economic reforms that the government would implement in exchange for their disarmament. The ELN has also criticized the government for staging separate negotiations with a breakout group in the country's southwest and angered officials by continuing to kidnap civilians and extort businesses.",
      "On Friday Petro suspended negotiations with the rebels after violence escalated in Catatumbo, a mountainous region that produces around 15% of Colombia's coca crop and is located along the border with Venezuela.",
      "The ELN, which has an estimated 6,000 fighters, reportedly attacked civilians it accused of being collaborators of a rival group, the FARC-EMC, taking people from their homes and shooting them in the streets, while in rural areas firefights broke out between members of both groups.",
      "In a statement issued on Monday, ELN leader Antonio Garc\u00eda said that his organization does not intend to target civilians, but has been going after former rebel fighters who are now collaborating with the FARC-EMC.",
      "Over the weekend, however, thousands of people fled towns in the Catatumbo region, fearing for their lives, including community leaders who had been threatened by the ELN. Among those fleeing were former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who demobilized in a 2016 peace deal with the government, and have now been targeted by the ELN.",
      "The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Colombia said Monday that the new wave of violence in Catatumbo has displaced 18,300 people, who are staying in shelters and hotels in the cities of Tibu, Oca\u00f1a and C\u00facuta, where officials have warned of a looming humanitarian crisis.",

      "The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia led to the demobilization of 11,000 fighters. However it left a power vacuum in some rural areas that smaller rebel groups have tried to fill, with the government struggling to reduce violence against civilians.",

      "The ceasefire between the military and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), which seized large tracts of territory along the border with China, is the second such pact in little over a year and came into effect on Saturday. A previous pact in January last year was not honored by either side.",
      "The new ceasefire was brokered by China in mid-January, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said at a daily briefing in Beijing.",

In 2023, imports accounted for 82% of the country\u2019s wood pellet demand, making South Korea the world\u2019s third-largest importer of biomass fuels, after the United Kingdom and Japan. An AP report found that biomass imported from Indonesia was linked to deforestation of natural, intact forest.",
      "\u201cAs the (biomass) market expanded, various issues emerged,\u201d the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy said in their press release. \u201cCriticisms regarding forest degradation and carbon emissions associated with biomass power generation persist.\"",
      "Under the revised policy, South Korea will not support any new biomass power plants. Subsidies for six existing state-owned plants co-firing coal and biomass will end this year, while the value of renewable energy certificates for three state-owned dedicated biomass plants will be phased down by 2027. At privately owned plants, subsidies for co-fired biomass from six plants will be phased out over the next decade, while subsidy weightings will be reduced for 12 dedicated biomass plants over the next 15 years.",
      "But environmental activists are critical of loopholes in the new policy.",
      "Domestically produced wood pellets and chips will still have the same level of support as before, including those co-fired with coal \u2014 which experts say could pose a threat to South Korea\u2019s forests. Power plants under construction or in planning with approved business permits are exempt from the new policy and subject to the phased reduction timelines for existing facilities.",
      "State-owned co-firing facilities \u2014 which will lose their renewable energy certificates \u2014 currently account for only 10% of South Korea\u2019s biomass power fleet, while the phase-out of most private co-firing will take over a decade to complete under the new policy, said Solutions for Our Climate.",
      "\u201cThis extends the life of thermal power plants \u2014 many with emissions per unit of energy higher than coal \u2014 beyond the Paris Agreement-aligned coal phase-out deadlines,\u201d Song wrote in an email to AP.",
      "The South Korean Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy, Korea Forest Service and Ministry of Environment did not respond to requests for comment from AP.",
      "Experts said South Korea's policy change could signal a shift in how countries consider and incorporate biomass as part of their own energy transitions.",
      "\u201cThere has been a positive shift in terms of discourse around biomass subsidies,\u201d said Claire Squire, a research associate at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy Center for Global Sustainability. \u201cCutting subsidies won\u2019t necessarily fix everything, but potentially if they\u2019re constructed differently than they have in the past, that might be an improvement.\u201d",
      "As countries accelerate their energy transitions, demand for biomass is growing: The use of bioenergy has increased an average of about 3% per year between 2010 and 2022, the International Energy Agency said.",
      "Experts including the IEA say it\u2019s important for that demand to happen in a sustainable way, such as using waste and crop residue rather than converting forest land to grow bioenergy crops. Deforestation contributes to erosion, damages biodiverse areas, threatens wildlife and humans who rely on the forest and intensifies disasters from extreme weather.",
      "Many scientists and environmentalists have rejected the use of biomass altogether. They say burning wood-based biomass can emit more carbon than coal and tree-cutting greatly reduces forests\u2019 ability to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Critics also say that using biomass to co-fire, instead of transitioning directly to clean energy, simply prolongs the use of coal.",

      "The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions.",
      "The price of bitcoin and other digital assets has soared since Trump won. A lavish \u201cCrypto Ball\u201d Friday ahead of Trump's inauguration sold tickets for thousands of dollars and featured a performance by the rapper Snoop Dogg.",

      "Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin\u2019s release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall.

    "summary": "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising to eliminate what he incorrectly labels &ldquo;the electric vehicle mandate&rdquo; imposed under former President Joe Biden",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order promising to eliminate what he incorrectly labels \u201cthe electric vehicle mandate\u201d imposed under former President Joe Biden",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order promising to eliminate what he incorrectly labels \u201cthe electric vehicle mandate\u201d imposed under former President Joe Biden. His order on Monday is consistent with pledges Trump made on the campaign trail to end what he calls a \u201cpreposterous\u201d focus on EV's by Biden and other Democrats. The order, along with other steps expected in a second Trump administration, could slow U.S. efforts to address climate change, much of which is caused by burning gasoline and diesel fuel that emit carbon dioxide and other planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "Here is a look at Trump's actions and what happens next.",
      "Trump's order said he would \u201celiminate the electric vehicle (EV) mandate\u201d and promote true consumer choice, which is essential for economic growth and innovation, by removing regulatory barriers to motor vehicle access; by ensuring a level regulatory playing field for consumer choice in vehicles.\" While there is no Biden \u201cmandate\u201d to force the purchase of EVs, the Democratic president's policies were aimed at encouraging Americans to buy them and car companies to shift from gas-powered vehicles to electric cars.",
      "Trump's order, entitled \"Unleashing American Energy,'' also said his administration would terminate \"where appropriate, state emissions waivers that function to limit sales of gasoline-powered automobiles; and by considering the elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions that favor EVs over other technologies and effectively mandate their purchase by individuals, private businesses, and government entities alike by rendering other types of vehicles unaffordable.\u201d",
      "Language in the order and others issued by Trump on Monday indicate he is likely to seek to repeal a $7,500 tax credit for new EV purchases approved by Congress as part of Biden's landmark 2022 climate law, as well as roll back Biden-era Environmental Protection Agency rules to tighten limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other pollution from passenger and commercial vehicles.",
      "Trump has also promised to end a federal exemption that allows California to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars by 2035. The federal waiver is important not only to California but also to more than a dozen other states that follow its nation-leading standards on vehicle emissions.",
      "Trump\u2019s order Monday was reminiscent of action taken during his first term in the White House, when he rolled back tough vehicle emissions standards set under Democratic then-President Barack Obama.",
      "In the executive order, Trump also put an immediate pause to billions of dollars in funding allocated for EV charging stations appropriated through the climate law, known as the Inflation Reduction Act and the bipartisan infrastructure law approved in 2021.",
      "Biden had set a goal of creating 500,000 such chargers by 2030. As of late last year, there were 214 operational chargers in 12 states that have been funded through the federal laws, with 24,800 projects underway across the country, according to the Federal Highway Administration. A total of more than 203,000 publicly available charging ports are operating across the U.S., with nearly 1,000 being turned on every week, according to the agency. This is more than double the number available in 2021.",
      "While in office, Biden set a goal for half of all new vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2030 to be electric and dedicated funding to EV charging infrastructure through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant programs.",
      "Under the former president, the EPA created tailpipe limits to curb planet-warming emissions from passenger vehicles. The final rules are the most ambitious standards of their kind in the nation. Still, automakers could meet the EPA\u2019s limits with sales of EVs as low as 30% in 2032, along with more fuel-efficient gasoline-powered vehicles.",
      "Also under Biden, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration set standards on fuel-efficiency requirements, which required new vehicles sold in the nation to average about 38 miles per gallon of gasoline in 2031, up from about 29 mpg in 2024.",
      "Both sets of rules inherently incentivized automakers to electrify their lineups for American car buyers.",
      "Though the pace of EV sales growth in the U.S. slowed last year, EVs accounted for 8.1% of new vehicle sales, up from 7.9% the year before, according to Motorintelligence.com.",
      "While the cost of EVs has slowly come down as the auto industry scales manufacturing of the vehicles and expensive battery prices improve, they still cost more upfront than traditional gasoline-powered cars.",
      "Even before Monday's order, some automakers have pulled back ambitious plans to go electric. Ford nixed plans for electric three-row SUVs in lieu of making them gas-electric hybrids; General Motors delayed production at an EV battery cell plant.",
      "Temporarily, sales of EVs could skyrocket as car-buyers rush to take advantage of existing tax credits encouraging electrified car purchases.",
      "But the order also means the U.S. could have a more challenging time meeting emissions reductions goals in the long run. Light-duty cars and trucks are responsible for more than half of the U.S. greenhouse gases from transportation, and the sector itself is a major contributor to the nation\u2019s overall emissions.",
      "Any action to roll back or revise regulations is likely to face legal challenges from environmental groups and others.",
      "\u201cThese clean car rollbacks will burden Americans with a Trumpfecta of higher prices, more pollution and weaker competitiveness,\u201d said Dan Becker, director of the Center for Biological Diversity\u2019s Safe Climate Transport Campaign. \u201cTrump\u2019s attacking the biggest single step ever taken to fight climate pollution.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- Small businesses had a merry December, as shoppers wrapped up their holiday shopping.",
      "That's according to the Fiserv Small Business Index.",
      "In the U.S., the seasonally adjusted index for December was 146, up 3 points from November. The figure is derived from point-of-sale transaction data, including card, cash, and check transactions in-store and online across about 2 million U.S. small businesses.",
      "\u201cSmall business sales continued their growth in December despite consumer spending patterns beginning to shift,\u201d said Prasanna Dhore, Chief Data Officer at Fiserv. \u201cNotably, consumers diverted more spend to service-based business, retail spending continued to display strength, and consumers spent less dining out as average restaurant ticket sizes continued to decline.\u201d",
      "Fiserv, a payment and financial services technology company, found that small business sales rose 4.9% and total transactions grew 5.5% from December the year prior.",
      "That echoed trends at larger businesses. The National Retail Federation, the nation\u2019s largest retail trade group, said holiday sales in November and December rose 4% to $994.1 billion compared with the previous year. For the holiday period in 2023, sales increased 3.9% compared with the previous two-month period. The holiday sales growth was above the group\u2019s expectations for a 2.5% to 3.5% increase for the period.",
      "Retail spending at small businesses remained a high point. Retail sales rose 4.9% and transactions rose 5.8% in December. The strongest selling categories were general merchandise, clothing, shoes and jewelry retailers, furniture, electronics, appliances and grocery.",
      "Restaurants, however, were weaker. Sales fell 3.4% from December a year ago, even though transactions rose 4.1%. Full-service restaurants, including upscale and family dining locations, were the weakest performers, while quick service and fast casual restaurants performed better. The disparity in sales and transactions was the result of a significant reduction in average ticket size, down 7.4%, compared to 2023.",

      "After the weekly magazine Shukan Bunshun reported in December a 90 million yen ($580,000) settlement between Nakai and a woman over the alleged sexual assault at a 2023 dinner party, the former SMAP star issued a statement acknowledging a settlement over \u201ca trouble,\u201d but he denied using any violence.",
      "News of the scandal did not immediately trigger a flood of pullouts by sponsors. But many apparently started replacing their commercials with public service announcements after a news conference Friday by Fuji TV that triggered criticism that the company was lacking transparency and contrition over the affair.",
      "Major sponsors such as automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp.; cosmetics maker Shiseido; retailer Seven & I Holding Co. and life insurer Meiji Yasuda announced they were pulling ads from Fuji TV. Local media reports said more than 50 companies had done the same.",

      "Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, and one other claimant remain alone among hundreds who have settled lawsuits against News Group Newspapers, the publisher of The Sun and the now-defunct News of the World, over a llegations their phones were hacked and investigators unlawfully snooped on their lives.",
      "It will be the first case of its kind to go to trial against the publisher since a widespread phone hacking scandal forced Murdoch to close News of the World in 2011. News Group has settled more than 1,300 other claims.",

      "Here's a look at the case:",
      "Harry claims News Group journalists and private investigators they hired violated his privacy by using unlawful tactics to dig up dirt on him and his family between 1996 and 2011.",
      "His fellow claimant, Tom Watson, a former deputy leader of the Labour Party, said his voicemails were intercepted during a period when he was investigating the hacking scandal.",
      "Their lawyer said the newspapers had a widespread practice of using deception to obtain medical, phone and flight records, bugged homes and placed listening devices in cars.",
      "They allege that executives concealed the skullduggery through means that included destroying documents.",
      "\u201cThis allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied,\u201d News Group said in a statement.",

      "Under English civil law, a claimant who wins a court judgment that is lower than what they were offered to settle, has to pay the legal bills for both sides. The law is intended to discourage lengthy trials.",

      "Harry said he wished his family had joined him in making a stand against media offenses.",
      "\u201cBut, you know, I\u2019m doing this for my reasons,\u201d he said.",
      "News Group has failed to kill the case over the past two years, but Harry has experienced some setbacks in a series of sometimes bruising hearings.",

The judge said those allegations would add nothing material to claims that include other \u201ctrusted lieutenants,\u201d such as Brooks and Murdoch\u2019s younger son, James Murdoch.",

      "The state Department of Agriculture announced Friday that the agency has detected a case of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza at a commercial poultry producer in Elbert County, approximately 100 miles (165 kilometers) northeast of Atlanta. The agency suspended all poultry exhibitions, shows, swaps, meets and sales.",
      "The virus has been detected four times in Georgia, but only in backyard flocks previously, including among 13 chickens and ducks earlier this month in Clayton County south of Atlanta.",

      "MILAN -- The independent Italian fashion brand Simon Cracker denounced the luxury fashion system with an upcycled collection previewed during Milan Fashion Week on Sunday that riffed on what they see as bygone days of quality and creativity.",
      "The coed looks created from recovered and deadstock garments, materials and accessories included a tongue-in-cheek swipe at Hermes\u2019 highly prized Birkin bag, with the designers drawing the telltale hardware on leather bags or screen-printing images of the coveted bag on sweaters.",
      "Co-creative directors Simone Botte and Filippo Biraghi were delighted that Walmart came out with what was widely seen as a Birkin knockoff while they were working on this collection.",
      "\u201cPeople have lost interest in fashion,'' Biraghi said. \"They have been taken for a ride for 20 years. And with 50 wars in the world, climate change, we all are getting poorer. There is no longer a connection between price and value. At a certain point, you can't go on.\u2019\u2019",
      "The collection pokes fun at the typical Milanese signora, known in dialect as sciura, sending her up with funky tweed separates, a foulard and even a tiny dog. Each silhouette is unique, constructed from garments the pair recover from dry cleaners and other sources, and models slide into character with insouciant slouches and exaggerated catwalk strides.",
      "The brand extended its collaboration with Doc Martens, decorated with trompe l\u2019oeil ballerina shoes. At times, skirts, collars and decorative fringe were fashioned out of shiny tinsel packing material, and ribbons covered shoes.",
      "The show closed with a garment completely concealed by luxury tags from Biraghi\u2019s own wardrobe collected over the years. \"We are making fun of wealth,'' he said.",
      "The Simon Cracker runway critique hits the sector when its down \u2014 and analysts say in need of reform.",
      "A new study by McKinsey consultancy and The Business of Fashion said that top brands are facing a significant slowdown this year, after a four-year period of exceptional growth from 2019-2023 that allowed the sector to grow by a compounded 5% a year despite the pandemic.",
      "Most of that expansion \u2014 a full 80% \u2014 was due to price increases that outpaced innovation, the McKinsey-Business of Fashion report said.",
      "The Bain consultancy similarly has forecast a contraction of 2% for 2025, the first since the Great Recession, not including the 2020 pandemic year. It cited a crisis in creativity along side global turbulence.",
      "The findings are of no surprise to Botte and Biraghi.",
      "\u201cIf a garment is not interesting, it it doesn\u2019t tell a story, if there is nothing creative, who cares,'' said Biraghi. \u201cWe all have lots of clothes, too many. We don\u2019t need more.\u201d",
      "Italian singer Chiara Galiazzo was in the front row dressed in a pinstripe and plaid jacket painted in sky blue and worn with royal blue Bermuda cutoffs and matching painted boots. She said she was drawn to the brand by its authenticity.",
      "\u201cI feel like I am part of a community,\u2019\u2019 she said after the show. \u201cI think this is something that is important, and a lot of fun.\u201d"

      "\u201cMaybe, it reads as savage, primitive cavemen. I think that our aim was to make it feel warm and human and instinctive, but also kind of beautifully domestic in a way,\u201d Simons said backstage.",
      "Cinematic references were broad and not specific to any film, director or even character type, Simons said. Western touches included scuffed cowboy boots and knitwear mimicking a wrangler\u2019s shirt - without creating characters or caricatures.",
      "Feminine touches flourished. Men were invited to wear jewelry, such as bracelets with mini basketballs or baseballs. Chains with amulets hung from fine knits. Fake fur-lined hoods came in florals.",
      "The silhouette mixed skinny trousers, often in bright rock-and-roll satin, with more ample volumes like pajama tops or slightly ratty sweaters. Suits required no shirts, as the designers advocated instinctive dressing.",
      "One look seemed to distill the collection to its boyish essence: Straight leg jeans with a knit top featuring striped detailing, worn with floral-stamped cowboy boots.",
      "The designers said the collection was meant to offer hope in difficult times, proffering humanity as a form of resistance to whatever may be oppressing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of an answer to what of course is happening. We have to resist with our instinct, with our humanity, with our passion, with our romance,\u2019\u2019 Prada said backstage. Good work, she said, is also a form of resistance.",
      "The message contained in the collection \"has to be optimistic by definition and in principle,\u2019\u2019 Prada said.",
      "The ever-transforming showroom inside the Prada Foundation\u2019s Deposito contemporary art space was sheathed in Art Noveau carpet, and the runway was set on raised metal scaffolding. Simons said it represented contrasts, decoration and a work-in-progress.",
      "Suits require no shirts. Two puffers are better than one. Raw shearling collars let loose primitive instincts. Subtle jewelry and florals for men. Cowboy boots.",
      "Prada's front row hailed from across the globe and disciplines, including British actor and musician William Gao, arriving with British musician Olivia Hardy, U.S. actor Keith Powers, South Korean actress Kim Tae-ri, Chinese table tennis player Ma Long and British actor Louis Patridge. A crowd of fans waited just beyond a barricade to cheer them all."

      "Except for the settlement, a hearing officer \u2014 in consultation with Causey \u2014 would have decided what the new rates should be. The Rate Bureau could have appealed that decision in court.",
      "Causey said in a news release that the proposed rate increases \u201care sufficient to make sure that insurance companies, who have paid out large sums due to natural disasters and face increasing reinsurance costs due to national catastrophes, have adequate funds on hand to pay claims.\"",
      "The bureau attributed its large request to high inflation \u2014 particularly on building materials \u2014 combined with calamitous storms and \u201cseverely inadequate\u201d premium rates to cover claims. The bureau\u2019s requested increases had varied widely from just over 4% in parts of the mountains to over 99% in some beach areas.",
      "The agreed-upon increases, carried out in two parts, will vary based on location. On average statewide, the base rate will increase by 7.5% on June 1 and by another 7.5% on June 1, 2026.",
      "The highest increases generally will occur in parts of eastern North Carolina hit hard by Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and Hurricane Florence in 2018, The News & Observer of Raleigh reported. For example, beach areas from Carteret to Brunswick counties will see an average 16% increase in mid-2025 and an additional 15.9% in mid-2026.",
      "Areas harmed the most by historic flooding from Hurricane Helene in the fall will face lower-than-average increases. Base rates in Buncombe, Watauga and Yancey counties, for example, will increase by 4.4% in 2025 and 4.5% in mid-2026.",
      "Among highly populated areas, base rates in Raleigh and Durham will increase on average by 7.5% in each of the next two years. In Charlotte, rates would increase by 9.3% in 2025 and by 9.2 % in 2026.",
      "The settlement also bars the Rate Bureau from undertaking an effort to increase rates again before June 1, 2027, Causey's release said.",
      "Bureau Chief Operating Officer Jarred Chappell said separately that the settlement is \u201ca step in the right direction\" but that the bureau had asked for a larger increase \u201cbecause that\u2019s what recent claims data called for.\"",
      "\"Storms have gotten stronger and more damaging, more people are living in disaster-prone areas, inflation in the construction industry has been particularly high and reinsurance costs have exploded. All these cost drivers remain an issue,\u201d Chappell said in a written statement.",
      "North Carolina insurance law contains a \u201cconsent-to-rate\u201d exception that allows industry members to insure high-risk homeowners if they agree to pay premiums at rates that are up to 250% of the bureau\u2019s rate.",
      "While some insurers have pulled out of disaster-prone parts of North Carolina, the exception has helped prevent a mass exodus of home insurers from the state. About 40% of the state\u2019s homeowners\u2019 policies were set by consent-to-rate policies in 2022, The News & Observer reported."

      "The U.S. Justice Department has filed a lawsuit accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions for Americans over the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids",
      "DEERFIELD, Ill. -- The U.S. Justice Department is accusing Walgreens of filling millions of prescriptions in the last decade and more without a legitimate purpose, including for dangerous amounts of opioids, according to a lawsuit filed this week.",
      "Filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, the complaint says the drugstore chain's pharmacists filled controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated they were highly likely to be unlawful. Walgreens also systematically pressured pharmacists to fill prescriptions without taking the time to confirm their validity, according to the complaint.",
      "The lawsuit says Walgreens filled \u201cunlawful\u201d prescriptions in violation of the federal Controlled Substances Act and sought reimbursement from federal health care programs for them in violation of the False Claims Act.",
      "Walgreens, one of the country\u2019s largest pharmacy chains, with over 8,000 locations, said in a statement that it stands behind its pharmacists. It said they say fill legitimate prescriptions for Food and Drug Administration-approved medications written by Drug Enforcement Administration-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.",
      "Walgreens is also accused of ignoring evidence, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, that stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, according to the complaint. In addition, it allegedly deprived pharmacists of crucial information including by preventing them from warning each another about particular prescribers.",
      "\u201cThis lawsuit seeks to hold Walgreens accountable for the many years that it failed to meet its obligations when dispensing dangerous opioids and other drugs,\u201d Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division, said in a statement. \u201cThese practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\u201d",
      "The company said it is asking the court to clarify the responsibilities of pharmacies and pharmacists and to protect against the government\u2019s attempt to enforce arbitrary \u201crules\u201d that do not appear in any law or regulation and never went through any official rulemaking process.",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by and allow the government to put our pharmacists in a no-win situation, trying to comply with \u201crules\u201d that simply do not exist,\u201d Walgreens said in the statement.",
      "The company also said it has been a leader in providing education and resource, as well as implementing the best policies and procedures to help combat opioid misuse.",
      "The DOJ filed a similar lawsuit against CVS in December. A spokesperson for that chain has said it strongly disagrees with the allegations and what it called a \u201cfalse narrative\u201d in the complaint.",
      "Federal prosecutors have been trying to hold companies accountable for their alleged roles in the U.S. addiction and overdose crisis, with opioids tied to over 80,000 annual deaths in some recent years.",
      "During the past decade, most of those deaths have mostly been attributed to illicit fentanyl, which is laced into many illegal drugs. Prescription pills were the primary cause earlier.",
      "Over the past eight years, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacies have agreed to approximately $50 billion in settlements with governments, with the majority of the money going toward fighting the crisis."

    "story": [
      "A fire at a one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy sources",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A fire at one of the world\u2019s largest battery plants in Northern California contained tens of thousands of lithium batteries that store power from renewable energy and have become a growing electricity source.",
      "By a long shot, California and Texas are opening more large-scale battery projects than anywhere else in the U.S., bolstering power reliability in two large states where extreme weather fueled by climate change has led to electricity shortages and blackouts.",
      "The fire that started Thursday at the Vistra Energy battery plant in Moss Landing, roughly 80 miles (about 130 kilometers) south of San Francisco, led to 1,700 people evacuating, closed part of Highway 1 and generated huge flames and significant amounts of smoke. The cause is under investigation.",
      "Experts say lithium batteries are a safe technology essential for lowering carbon emissions and making grids more reliable. Still, residents near the fire expressed concerns about the impact.",
      "In Texas, which is bracing for another blast of Artic winter weather next week, officials have credited batteries with helping stabilize the state\u2019s independent grid, which was pushed to the brink of collapse during a deadly winter storm in 2021.",
      "Here\u2019s how and why batteries are booming in the two states:",
      "Both Texas and California grapple with blackouts while trying to meet the energy needs of tens of millions of people as well as industry, including artificial intelligence and data centers.",
      "Batteries soak up excess wind and solar energy for later use. That backup supply helps the grid during times of high demand, such as during a heat wave, when air conditioning use is heavy.",
      "The cost of lithium batteries has dropped dramatically, boosting their popularity. For electric vehicle lithium batteries, as an example, prices fell by about 90% between 2008 to 2022, according to the U.S. Department of Energy\u2019s Vehicle Technologies Office.",
      "Cheaper lithium has made utility-scale batteries more cost-competitive than some natural gas alternatives. Batteries can also be switched on and discharge power in a matter of seconds.",
      "The Texas grid is rapidly gaining utility-scale batteries and added a whopping 5 gigawatts of storage over the last year, helping to keep up with demand and avoid blackouts.",
      "The 2021 blackout and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 have helped drive the expansion. Texas\u2019 deregulatory environment has also allowed wind and solar projects to develop quickly and easily, increasing the demand for batteries.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot less red tape that power plants have to go through in Texas,\u201d said Joshua Rhodes, an energy researcher at The University of Texas at Austin. \u201cTexas generally doesn\u2019t have any regulations that stop development.\u201d",
      "Some experts say the cheaper cost of batteries is fueling their rapid adoption more than anything, however.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s as much of a story of regulation as it is economic efficiency,\u201d said Jay Turner, professor of environmental science at Wellesley College. \u201cThe price of batteries and renewable generation has fallen so much that batteries and solar and wind, when put together, are so cost-competitive.\u201d",
      "The state has long pursued sustainable energy and in 2002 created a set of clean energy standards that the International Energy Agency considers one of the most ambitious in the nation.",
      "As solar and wind became increasingly popular, there were concerns that it would be extremely challenging to integrate that energy into the grid because of their intermittent nature.",
      "\u201cEven back in 2005, it was like any more than 15% renewables on the grid would be impossible,\u201d said Sally Benson, professor of energy science engineering at Stanford University. Last year California had more than 11 gigawatts of utility-scale storage on the grid.",
      "Part of California\u2019s motivation to act stems from electricity shortages. In 2020 the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) ordered rotating outages because the grid was overwhelmed with demand during a heat wave.",
      "Since then several gigawatts of battery storage has been added, a major reason CAISO hasn\u2019t ordered rotating outages in nearly four years, according to Denise Grab, an energy policy researcher at the University of California, Los Angeles.",

      "With President-elect Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple",
      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform \u2014 one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\u201d Chew said.",
      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday. In the memo, which was first reported by The New York Times and confirmed by the company, TikTok told workers that their \u201cemployment, pay and benefits\u201d were secure, adding that the law was written in a way that impacts the U.S. user experience, not the entities that employ them.",
      "Meanwhile, in a letter sent Friday to Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland, an attorney for TikTok creators who sued the government asked the administration to pause enforcement of the law \u201cuntil there is further definitive guidance.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn addition, we request that you clarify that no app store, internet hosting service, or other provider faces any risk of enforcement or penalties with respect to TikTok, CapCut, or any other ByteDance apps, until such further guidance has been issued,\u201d said the letter by attorney Jeffrey Fisher."

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still remaining optimistic,\" he said.",
      "Still, many continue to express fears over the potential of losing TikTok.",
      "Janette Ok, a full-time content creator based in Los Angeles, says TikTok is the primary platform she uses today. As an influencer and also an artist, she says the platform has helped her make brand deals and promote her music \u2014 bringing \u201copportunities that I never believed I could experience in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",
      "\u201cI hear all these different things, and I don\u2019t know what to believe \u2014 so that\u2019s where I\u2019m very frustrated. I\u2019m confused. I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",
      "She fears losing TikTok will hurt her business, and she'll miss it personally, too. So she\u2019s following what people are saying will happen on Sunday and hopes a ban might be diverted.",
      "\u201cIt kind of seems like Biden\u2019s kind of pushing it off to Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cSo people have hopes that maybe we have a few more days and it won\u2019t go dark on Sunday, but I don\u2019t really know.\u201d",
      "Alejandro Flores-Munoz owns a catering business in the Denver area called Combi Taco, or @combicafe on TikTok. TikTok helped him reach customers without spending money on marketing, he said. He was optimistic that TikTok would stick around until he heard Friday's Supreme Court decision.",
      "\u201cUp until today, I was extremely optimistic. And after today\u2019s Supreme Court decision to uphold the ban or the sale of TikTok, I weigh my options,\u201d he said. \u201cBut honestly, it\u2019s very disheartening, specifically because I truly did rely on the app for my business and my growth of my business.\u201d",

      "He could not have seemed happier.",
      "Wembanyama unveiled a gift of sorts to his hometown and the next generation on Tuesday, a pair of outdoor courts \u2014 one for 5-on-5 play, the other for 3-on-3 play \u2014 that were built to the specifications that he wanted and sketched out himself.",
      "\u201cFor those of you that don\u2019t know, this started in a room with an idea,\" San Antonio general manager Brian Wright said, as about five dozen kids sat on the court in front of him and another 100 or so people watched from adjacent courtside seating. \"And I remember watching Victor going on a whiteboard and literally drawing every single detail of the court that you see today and putting his heart and soul into designing this court for the children to play on. It speaks to how special you are and how special this is to you, so thank you, Victor.\u201d",
      "Wembanyama and the Spurs are in France this week, playing a pair of games Thursday and Saturday in Paris against the Indiana Pacers. France is Wembanyama's homeland, as everyone knows. And it's often assumed that he's from Paris, but he's from Le Chesnay \u2014 about 12 miles (20 kilometers) west of the city.",
      "It was important to him to make this happen in time for the Spurs' visit there. Others did not think that was realistic.",
      "\u201cImpossible,\u201d said Le Chesnay's mayor, Richard Delepierre.",
      "The challenges were many: There were old courts in that space to excavate, designs to be approved, it's not great weather for construction at this time of year, and if all that wasn't enough, building anything so close to the Palace of Versailles seems to be a bit of logistical headache, to say the least.",
      "But it's what Wemby wanted. And that makes things happen, especially in his hometown.",
      "\u201cBeyond his immense basketball talents, it seems that Victor possesses great qualities of art and a certain capacity for persuasion,\u201d Delepierre said.",
      "Construction really got going just a couple months ago. But on Tuesday, on a chilly afternoon, it was finished. The new nets were in place, the fibers still tight together as if to show not a single shot had gone through them yet. The kids peeled back a black drape to show off the center court design \u2014 a nod to both the Spurs' logo and the Le Chesnay clock tower \u2014 and Wembanyama caught a lob for the ceremonial first dunk.",
      "\u201cIt was my dream also to have these kind of courts when I was living here,\u201d Wembanyama said.",
      "Le Chesnay is a small city of about 30,000, a little west of downtown Paris. From town hall there's a view of the Palace of Versailles, the home King Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette shared in the late 18th century before he was beheaded during the French Revolution. Local legend suggests Napoleon roamed the area at times, even ordering that trees be planted to line the streets a certain way.",
      "It is also where Wembanyama's basketball life began to grow.",
      "Local officials say the majority of residents there \u2014 the Chesnaycourtois and Chesnaycourtoise \u2014 take part in some sort of sporting activity. Wembanyama created a bit of a stir in town when he brought friends in for an impromptu pickup soccer match last year, some of them roaming the same field that they did as little kids. Handball is extremely popular there, as are auto racing and equestrian. There even was a filly named Le Chesnay that raced at the famed Saratoga Race Course in 2009.",
      "But, officially or unofficially, it's a basketball town now. Kids are playing the game all the time in Le Chesnay, most of them \u2014 as one would guess \u2014 wearing Spurs jerseys or T-shirts. Wembanyama's 6-foot-3 mother, Elodie de Fautereau, was a standout player and became a coach.",
      "\u201cThe Spurs \u2018Play Paris\u2019 initiative isn\u2019t just about building a court, it\u2019s about creating a vibrant hub for the community that honors Victor\u2019s journey and his commitment to giving back,\u201d said RC Buford, CEO of Spurs Sports and Entertainment. \u201cThis renovated space will hopefully inspire the next generation and showcase the power of sports to bring people together.\u201d",
      "The Spurs haven't said what they spent on the project, but it was a \u201csignificant\u201d part of the estimated $500,000 budget, Delepierre said. It's also important to note that the courts aren't some Wembanyama tribute; the city logo and the Spurs logo are present, but nothing that screams the 2023-24 NBA rookie of the year's name.",
      "He didn't want them to be about him. And they got done just in time.",

      "Novak Djokovic has come back to defeat Carlos Alcaraz 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 to reach the Australian Open semifinals for the 12th time",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic refused to let anything stop his pursuit of a record 25th Grand Slam trophy in the Australian Open quarterfinals. Not a problem with his left leg. Not an early deficit. And not the kid across the net, Carlos Alcaraz, who was making things difficult and eyeing his own bit of history.",
      "Djokovic overcame it all, just as he has so often along the way to so many triumphs, moving into the semifinals at Melbourne Park for the 12th time with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Alcaraz in a scintillating showdown Tuesday night between a pair of stars born 16 years apart and at opposite ends of their careers.",
      "The action was non-stop, the shot-making brilliant, even as the match stretched on for more than 3 1/2 hours and nearly to 1 a.m. \u2014 never more so, perhaps, than when Alcaraz saved a break point that would have put Djokovic ahead 5-2 in the fourth set, allowing him to serve for the win. The 33-stroke exchange was the longest of the evening, and when it ended with Djokovic sailing a forehand long, the capacity crowd at Rod Laver Arena went wild. Djokovic reached for his bothersome leg and yelled toward his entourage; Alcaraz, his chest heaving, leaned on a towel box and grinned.",
      "Turned out that only delayed the final result.",
      "With his wife, son and daughter cheering in the stands, the No. 7-seeded Djokovic prevailed thanks to the sort of remarkable returning and no-mistakes-made groundstrokes against Alcaraz that now-retired rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal dealt with for years.",
      "Djokovic enjoyed some of his own best efforts in the latter stages, pointing to his ear or blowing kisses or spreading his arms while puffing out his chest. There was the forehand winner on a 22-stroke point that earned the break for a 5-3 lead in the third set. There was that set\u2019s last point, which included a back-to-the-net sprint to chase down a lob. Alcaraz wasn\u2019t shy, either, shouting \u201cVamos!\u201d and pumping his fists after one particularly booming forehand in the fourth set.",
      "On Friday, Djokovic\u2019s 50th major semifinal will come against No. 2 seed Alexander Zverev, a two-time runner-up at majors who beat No. 12 Tommy Paul 7-6 (1), 7-6 (0), 2-6, 6-1. The other men\u2019s quarterfinals are Wednesday: No. 1 Jannik Sinner vs. No. 8 Alex de Minaur, and No. 21 Ben Shelton against unseeded Lorenzo Sonego.",

      "\u201cHe should get his sleep now,\u201d Betts said, speaking Tuesday in Tokyo. \u201cBecause when the baby comes he won't get any.\u201d",

      "Both will be on display when the Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs open the Major League Baseball season on March 18 and 19 in two games at the Tokyo Dome.",
      "Betts said he'd already met with the 23-year-old Sasaki, who is being described as a \u201cphenom\u201d before he's even thrown a pitch in MLB. He'll join Ohtani and pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto on the Dodgers.",
      "\u201cRoki is really, really soft spoken,\u201d Betts said. \u201cYou can tell that he\u2019ll love being around Yoshi (Yamamoto) and Shohei. I think that will really help him a lot.\u201d",
      "Betts described Sasaki as being very reserved, which must be partly attributed to a language barrier.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to get him out of his shell,\u201d Betts said. \u201cI\u2019m going to laugh and joke and get him to really embrace the American culture. I think that will really help him to be the best pitcher on the planet. Because I think that everyone believes he can definitely be the best pitcher on the planet.\u201d",
      "Betts repeated what many have said about Ohtani, and gave Japanese media what they wanted to hear.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s like a god,\u201d Betts said. \u201cHis presence in the clubhouse \u2014 it's so important.\u201d",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 08:40:00 -0500",
    "summary": "There were several calls in the NFL's divisional round of the playoffs that drew scrutiny from broadcasters and fans alike over the weekend",
    "story": [
      "There were several calls in the NFL's divisional round of the playoffs that drew scrutiny from broadcasters and fans alike over the weekend",
      "NFL officials were heavily scrutinized for some of the flags they threw in the four divisional round games that saw the Chiefs, Bills, Eagles and Commanders advance to next weekend's conference championships.",
      "Yet, it was one play that didn't draw a flag could prove a most consequential non-call if the NFL decides to join the NBA and NHL in seriously cracking down on floppers, as ESPN broadcaster Troy Aikman suggested during the Texans-Chiefs game.",
      "NFL players can be penalized for the big umbrella \u201cunsportsmanlike conduct\" infraction, but there isn't an official rule against flopping, and Aikman urged the league to address that during one of his several conversations with Joe Buck over the officiating in the Chiefs' 23-14 victory.",
      "On the same possession where he benefitted from his late slide that caused two Texans to crash into each other, drawing a widely panned unnecessary roughness flag, Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes appeared to try to deke referee Clay Martin's officiating crew into throwing another flag to aid Kansas City's drive, which ended with a touchdown that put the Chiefs up by eight in the fourth quarter.",
      "Scrambling to his left, Mahomes pulled up just as he went out of bounds. When linebacker Henry To'oTo'o tapped him, Mahomes throws himself dramatically to the ground but failed to fool the officials \u2014 or impress Aikman, the Hall of Fame quarterback who earlier took umbrage at the roughing-the-passer call against Houston.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to draw the penalty. Rather than just run out of bounds, he slows down,\" Aikman protested. \"And that\u2019s been the frustration, and I get it. I understand it. That\u2019s been the frustration for these defensive players around the league.\u201d",
      "Earlier in the drive, Aikman said he \u201ccould not disagree\" more with the roughing penalty called on To'oTo'o and defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi, who smashed into each other and made incidental contact with Mahomes, who was underneath them after his late slide.",
      "When Martin announced the penalty, Aikman interjected, \u201cOh, come on!\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a runner. I could not disagree with that one more, and he barely gets hit,\u201d Aikman said, noting that Mahomes shouldn't have been afforded the extra protections provided quarterbacks in the pocket once he started running on the play. \u201cThat\u2019s the second (questionable) penalty now that\u2019s been called against the Texans. \u2026 It was a late flag, and it was Clay Martin who threw it.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve gotta address it in the offseason,\u201d Aikman added.",
      "ESPN's rules analyst Russell Yurk concurred that no flag should have been thrown on the play.",
      "After the game, Texans coach DeMeco Ryans suggested his team expected the Chiefs to benefit from the officiating: \u201cWe knew going into today it was us versus everybody. And when I say everybody, it's everybody.\u201d",
      "Yurk also disagreed with a roughing-the-passer flag on Texans pass rusher Will Anderson Jr. in the first quarter that erased a three-and-out by Kansas City, which went on to score a field goal on that drive: \u201cIt looked like that first contact was to the upper chest area. I didn\u2019t see anything there that supported a foul,\u201d Yurk said.",
      "Martin, the referee, told a pool reporter after the game that on the Anderson penalty, \u201cI had forcible contact the facemask area,\u201d and on the To'oTo'o infraction, when the quarterback slides, \u201che is considered defenseless. The onus is on the defender. I had forcible contact there to the hairline, to the helmet.\u201d",
      "Walt Anderson, longtime NFL senior vice president of officiating who moved into a new role as the league's rules analyst and club communications liaison last year, said Sunday that both calls were correct under the current rules.",
      "Anderson said in an appearance Sunday on the NFL Network that it might be up for debate about whether there was forcible contact on the roughing-the-passer flag in the first quarter but emphasized that the league's rulebook calls for officials to throw the flag if there's any doubt whether roughing has occurred.",
      "As for the second foul, where Mahomes slid late, Anderson said the two Texans defenders who crashed into each other made incidental contact with Mahomes once he was on the ground, so replay assist couldn't be used in that circumstance to pick up the flag.",
      "Anderson noted that the league's competition committee could revisit either infraction and tweak the rules this offseason.",
      "Aikman, for one, would like to see the league crack down on flopping, as well.",

    "story": [
      "Coco Gauff has lost in the Australian Open quarterfinals to Paula Badosa 7-5, 6-4",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff's retooled forehand and serve abandoned her in the worst way and at the worst time at the Australian Open. The unforced errors just kept accumulating Tuesday, and so did the double-faults and break points, often followed by a palm placed over her eyes or a slap to a thigh.",
      "Add it all up, and Gauff's trip to Melbourne Park \u2014 and her 13-match winning streak that dated to late last season \u2014 ended in the quarterfinals. Never able to take control on a hot afternoon in Rod Laver Arena, the 2023 U.S. Open champion was eliminated by No. 11 Paula Badosa of Spain 7-5, 6-4.",
      "Using tweaks to some key strokes, and a change to her coaching team after a disappointing end to her title defense in New York in September, the 20-year-old Gauff arrived in Australia with hopes of earning a second Grand Slam title.",
      "\u201cI feel like (at the) U.S. Open, I was playing with no solution, so that was more the frustrating part. Today, I feel like I\u2019m playing with solutions; I know what I need to work on. U.S. Open, I needed to work on my serve. Not saying that my serve is where I want it to be, but I worked on it; obviously, a big improvement. So I want to continue working on that, continue working on playing aggressive,\u201d Gauff said.",
      "\u201cSo I feel like I\u2019m on the road to the right way, right path,\u201d she said. \u201cEven though I lost today, I feel like I\u2019m in an upward trajectory.\u201d",
      "The American entered Tuesday with a 9-0 record in 2025; she also won her last four matches of last season to collect the trophy at the WTA Finals in November.",
      "\u201cJust a lot more work to do,\u201d Gauff said after the 1-hour, 43-minute loss to Badosa, who had been 0-2 in Grand Slam quarterfinals. \u201cI\u2019m obviously disappointed, but I\u2019m not completely crushed.\u201d",
      "Badosa now heads to her first Grand Slam semifinal at age 27 \u2014 and less than a year after she was contemplating retirement because of a stress fracture in her back that took what felt like forever to heal and did not initially respond to cortisone injections.",
      "\u201cI wanted to (give) it a last try,\u201d Badosa said, \u201cWell, here I am. So I\u2019m really proud of what we went through with all my team and especially how I (fought) through all that, especially mentally.\u201d",
      "In Thursday\u2019s semifinals, she will go up against either her close friend, No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka, the two-time defending champion in Melbourne, or No. 27 Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova, the runner-up at the 2021 French Open. Their quarterfinal was Tuesday night.",
      "No. 2 Alexander Zverev, a two-time finalist at other majors, was the first man into this year's Australian Open semifinals, getting there for the third time since 2020 by beating No. 12 Tommy Paul 7-6 (1), 7-6 (0), 2-6, 6-1. Paul was one point from taking the first set, then a point from taking the second, but couldn't close the deal, and Zverev was simply superior in the ensuing tiebreakers.",
      "Zverev faces the winner of the most-anticipated men's quarterfinal: Novak Djokovic vs. Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "Djokovic, 37, is aiming for an 11th Australian Open trophy and a record 25th Grand Slam singles title overall. Alcaraz seeks to complete a career Grand Slam at age 21 by adding a championship in Australia to the ones he already owns: two from Wimbledon plus one apiece from the U.S. Open and French Open.",
      "Badosa was hurt during a practice at the tournament in Rome in May 2023, shortly after she began working with coach Pol Toledo. A year later, including several months off the tour, there still were issues.",
      "\u201cThe reality is that the back was not responding. We couldn\u2019t find a solution. Paula was frustrated,\u201d Toledo said. \u201cI was like: This is not working. I don\u2019t know what we have to do.\u201d",
      "Relying on a new doctor, fitness coach and nutritionist, Badosa tried different exercises and supplements, and her back improved.",
      "\u201cThe puzzle,\u201d she said, \u201cstarted to look better.\u201d",
      "On Tuesday, she kept the pressure on Gauff, who finished with 41 unforced errors, including six double-faults and 28 missed forehands. Badosa compiled 10 break points and won four of Gauff's service games. Gauff, meanwhile, never earned so much as a single break point until after already down a set and a break.",
      "One key game \u2014 and one that illustrated Gauff\u2019s problems on this afternoon \u2014 started the second set. It lasted 22 points spread over more than a dozen minutes, and Badosa converted her fifth break chance after Gauff missed two forehands in a row.",
      "Of Badosa\u2019s 12 points in that game, 11 came via mistakes by Gauff, including seven errant forehands.",
      "\u201cToday,\u201d Gauff said, \u201cshe did better in those key moments.\u201d",
      "When Badosa ended the quarterfinal with a forehand winner, she placed her hand over her mouth, then knelt on the ground and bowed her head. This was a big moment for someone who reached a career-best ranking of No. 2 in 2022, but only now believes she's reached her full potential.",
      "\u201cEmotionally, I wanted it so much,\u201d Badosa said. \u201cI\u2019m never going to feel freedom until I win the tournament. I\u2019m always like this. It\u2019s my personality. It\u2019s my character.\"",

      "The agreement includes an opt out and a 2030 team option with escalators that could increase the value to $110 million over six seasons, according to his agency, the Beverly Hills Sports Council.",
      "Toronto made a play for Shohei Ohtani last year and was in the mix for Juan Soto before he joined the New York Mets in December. The Blue Jays also were reportedly one of the finalists for Roki Sasaki before the Japanese pitcher said he intends to sign with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "But Toronto managed to put Santander in its lineup alongside Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Bo Bichette and George Springer. The Blue Jays are looking to rebound after finishing last in the AL East with a 74-88 record in 2024.",
      "Santander set career highs with 44 homers, 102 RBIs and 91 runs scored in 155 games for Baltimore last year. The outfielder batted .235 with a .506 slugging percentage while making the AL All-Star team for the first time.",
      "Santander, who turned 30 in October, was the majors\u2019 first switch hitter to reach 40 homers since 2006. He became the fourth switch hitter to hit at least 44 homers in a season, joining Mickey Mantle (twice), Lance Berkman and Chipper Jones.",
      "The Venezuelan slugger helped Baltimore get into the playoffs for the second straight year, but it was swept by Kansas City in the opening round.",
      "Santander received a qualifying offer after the season, so the Orioles will receive a compensatory pick after the first round of this year's amateur draft. The Blue Jays lose their second draft pick and $500,000 in 2026 international signing bonus allocation.",
      "Left-hander Brandon Eisert was designated for assignment to make room for Santander on Toronto's 40-man roster.",
      "Santander signed with Cleveland as an international free agent in July 2011. He was selected by Baltimore in the Rule 5 draft in December 2016.",
      "After being sidelined by right elbow inflammation, he made his major league debut with the Orioles on Aug 18, 2017, but he appeared in only 13 games that first year.",
      "Santander had a breakout performance in 2022, batting .240 with 33 homers and 89 RBIs in 152 games. He stamped himself as part of an emerging group of young players as the Orioles went 83-79 after losing 110 games in the previous season.",
      "Santander hit .257 with 28 homers, 95 RBIs and a career-high 41 doubles as Baltimore won the 2023 AL East title with a 101-61 record. The Orioles then were swept by the Rangers in their AL Division Series.",

    "story": [
      "Ohio State can celebrate another title after holding off a Notre Dame comeback bid to walk away with a nailbiter of a 34-23 victory over the Fighting Irish",
      "ATLANTA -- The pass seemed to hang up there forever. Did it feel like seven weeks? Did it feel like 10 years?",
      "What a great debate for Ohio State fans to have forever.",
      "When that teardrop of a throw from Buckeyes quarterback Will Howard on third-and-11 finally landed, light as a feather, in the hands of receiver Jeremiah Smith late in the fourth quarter Monday, Ohio State had locked up what would be a 34-23 victory over Notre Dame for its sixth national title and first in a decade.",
      "It was that 56-yard gain that snuffed out a feverish Notre Dame comeback and made the Buckeyes the champion of the sport's first 12-team playoff, just as they were champions of its first four-team tournament a decade ago.",
      "\u201cThey were running man coverage and I said, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m gonna let this loose and let him make a play on it,\u2019\u201d Howard said of a play that felt about 100 years removed from Ohio State's once program-defining \u201cThree yards and a cloud of dust.\u201d",
      "This was a win that hardly anyone thought possible a mere seven weeks ago \u2014 Nov. 30 \u2014 when a 13-10 loss to Michigan led to a near-riot on the field and questions over whether coach Ryan Day would keep his job when the calendar flipped.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great story about a bunch of guys who have just overcome some really tough situations, and at the point where there\u2019s a lot of people that counted us out (they) just kept swinging and kept fighting,\u201d Day said.",
      "It might be that much sweeter because of how it went down in a jam-packed stadium in the middle of SEC country that looked like a Christmas tree \u2014 Ohio State fans on one half in red, Notre Dame's on the other in green.",
      "Trailing 31-7, Notre Dame scored two touchdowns and two 2-point conversions to make it a one-score game late in the fourth quarter. The in-stadium camera found legendary Irish coach Lou Holtz in his luxury box, and he ignored all those booing Buckeye fans and flashed a thumbs-up.",
      "But Notre Dame's time was running out. After stopping the Buckeyes on their first two plays and using their timeouts, the Irish put Christian Gray \u2014 whose interception wrapped up Notre Dame's semifinal win over Penn State \u2014 in single coverage on Smith.",
      "Smith got behind Gray on the right sideline and Howard dropped his best pass of the season into the hands of the second-team All-American.",
      "It set up a field goal that started the celebration in earnest, and also helped Ohio State cover the 8 1/2-point spread at BetMGM Sportsbook.",
      "\u201cIt was do or die, it was that type of down,\u201d Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said. \u201cHe\u2019s a heck of a player. He\u2019s difficult to cover.\u201d",
      "Howard, a transfer-portal success story from Kansas State, threw for 231 yards and two scores, but nothing will beat the pass to Smith with everything on the line.",
      "The receiver, who had been bottled up by Texas in the semifinals then fairly quiet for most of this game, finally got loose for the kind of play he\u2019s been making all year. He finished with five catches for 88 yards.",
      "\u201cWe felt at the end we wanted to give Jeremiah that shot,\u201d Day said. \u201cWe really hadn't thrown it all night, but I thought, \u2018Know what, let\u2019s be aggressive, let's do this and lay it on the line.'\u201d",
      "Ohio State didn't really look like a team that needed to take risks after scoring touchdowns on its first four possessions, then adding a field goal on its fifth.",
      "When Quinshon Judkins (100 yards, 11 carries, three TDs), a transfer from Mississippi who highlighted Ohio State\u2019s judicious use of the ever-growing portal, busted a 70-yard run to set up the score that made it 28-7, this game looked over.",
      "It wasn\u2019t, and now Freeman will have to answer a few tough questions \u2014 one about the failed fake punt in the third quarter that turned into a field goal for a 31-7 lead; the other about sending Mitch Jeter in for a short field goal attempt while down 16 and facing fourth-and-goal from the 9. It might have looked like a better call had Jeter\u2019s kick not clanged off the left upright.",
      "\u201cI know it\u2019s still a two-score game, but you have a better probability of getting 14 points than you do 16 points,\u201d Freeman said.",
      "Really, though, Ohio State was the better team. The Buckeyes outgained Notre Dame 445 yards to 308. Howard completed his first 13 passes and never really got stopped. Ohio State punted a grand total of once.",
      "The Buckeyes rolled through four games in the new, expanded playoff \u2014 what great timing for Ohio State that the tournament swelled to a dozen teams in a year it didn't even play for the Big Ten title \u2014 by an average score of 36-21.",
      "Ohio State was seeded eighth, but the seedings were pretty much meaningless. The worse seed won every game in the quarterfinal and semifinal rounds, and the Buckeyes dominated in this title-game showdown of No. 7 vs. No. 8.",
      "It puts to rest, for now, any angst about that 13-10 Michigan loss in November \u2014 Ohio State\u2019s fourth straight in the series \u2014 that ended with a brawl after Wolverine players tried to plant a flag at midfield.",
      "The whole scene left a lot of folks, both in and out of Buckeye circles, thinking Day, in his sixth season, had outlived his usefulness on a campus that hadn\u2019t tasted a title in a decade.",
      "Instead, the Ohio State marching band can dot the \u201cI\u201d next time with the national-title trophy. And Day can join a list of title-winning coaches with Urban Meyer (2014) Jim Tressel (2002), Woody Hayes (\"Three yards and a cloud of dust\") and Paul Brown (who went on to become the namesake of the NFL's Cleveland Browns).",
      "Also, Day\u2019s .873 winning percentage coming into the game was third among coaches with 50-plus games \u2014 one spot behind none other than the Notre Dame legend Knute Rockne, himself.",
      "The Notre Dame loss means college football still has never had a Black coach win the national title. Freeman was trying to become the first.",
      "Instead, another kind of history. This marked the first time the Big Ten has taken back-to-back titles since 1942. Last year\u2019s champion was Michigan, which was sitting home watching this one, but still played a special role in a Buckeyes redemption story hardly anyone saw coming.",

    "story": [
      "Novak Djokovic has received the apologies he wanted from the Australian Open\u2019s local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) \u2014 Novak Djokovic got the mea culpas he wanted from the Australian Open's local broadcaster and its employee who insulted him on the air and so, according to tournament organizers, the 24-time Grand Slam champion is ready to concentrate on his quarterfinal showdown with Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "\u201cNovak acknowledges the apology has been given in public as requested,\" read a statement issued Monday by Tennis Australia, \"and is now moving on and focusing on his next match.\u201d",
      "That, perhaps, will draw a curtain on the bizarre off-court distraction as Djokovic pursues what would be an 11th championship at Melbourne Park and a record 25th major trophy overall.",
      "After winning at Rod Laver Arena on Sunday evening to set up the contest against No. 3 Alcaraz, Djokovic declined to do the customary post-match on court TV interview, but didn't immediately say why, eliciting some jeering from spectators. Only later that night, at his news conference, did Djokovic explain that he was taking a stand to protest comments made by Tony Jones on Channel 9 on Friday.",
      "Djokovic, a 37-year-old from Serbia, did not name Jones, but said a \u201cfamous sports journalist who works for official broadcaster Channel 9 ... made a mockery of Serbian fans and also made insulting and offensive comments toward me.\u201d",
      "Jones called Djokovic overrated and a has-been and made what seemed to be a reference to when the player was deported from Australia in 2022 because he was not vaccinated against COVID-19.",
      "Djokovic added that he would continue to avoid speaking to the network without an apology from it and Jones.",
      "Those finally arrived on Monday.",
      "Nine Network said in a statement it apologized \u201cfor any offense caused from comments made\" while live on air.",
      "\u201cNo harm was intended towards Novak or his fans,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cWe look forward to further showcasing his Australian Open campaign at Melbourne Park.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on a TV show Monday, Jones said he intended his words as \u201cbanter\u201d and apologized to Djokovic \u201cif he felt that I disrespected him.\u201d",
      "\u201cI considered it to be humor, which is consistent with most things I do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHaving said that, I was made aware ... that the Djokovic camp was not happy at all with those comments. I immediately contacted the Djokovic camp and issued an apology to them. And as I stand here now, I stand by that apology to Novak.\u201d",
      "Jones also offered words to Serbians.",
      "\u201cI do feel as though I\u2019ve let down the Serbian fans,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not just saying this to try and wriggle out of trouble or anything. I genuinely feel for those fans.\u201d",
      "Serbia\u2019s ambassador to Australia, Rade Stefanovic, even got involved Monday, telling the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper that Jones\u2019 comments were \u201cclearly unprofessional,\u201d including a \u201cmost concerning\u201d reference to what happened three years ago when Djokovic was kicked out of the country ahead of the tournament amid the pandemic.",
      "Before Jones and his employer offered their apologies, Djokovic posted a message on social media reiterating why he declined to speak. That drew a reply from billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who said, \u201cIt\u2019s way better just to talk to the public directly than go through the negativity filter of legacy media.\u201d",
      "Djokovic replied to Musk's tweet with \u201cIndeed\u201d and a raised-hands emoji.",

      "Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday",
      "NANTERRE, France -- Officially, Indiana will be the home team on the scoreboard when it plays San Antonio in Paris on Thursday.",
      "The Pacers know better. They will not be feeling right at home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big crowd against us, honestly,\u201d Indiana guard Andrew Nembhard said.",
      "He\u2019s not wrong, for one 7-foot-4 reason. The upcoming NBA Paris Games \u2014 Indiana vs. San Antonio on Thursday and Saturday, the Pacers being the designated home team for the first matchup and the Spurs getting that distinction for the second game \u2014 are essentially going to be a weeklong celebration of France\u2019s own Victor Wembanyama, San Antonio\u2019s reigning NBA rookie of the year who likely will be an All-Star this season for the first time.",
      "In other words, welcome to Wemby Week in Paris.",
      "The teams arrived in Paris on Monday, with practices and other events scheduled throughout the week and then the games toward the end. The Spurs were coming straight from the airport to a light workout in Nanterre \u2014 the place where Wembanyama started his pro career in the French league as a 15-year-old.",
      "There have been single games in Paris in each of the last two seasons \u2014 Chicago-Detroit in 2023, Brooklyn-Cleveland last year \u2014 but this season, it\u2019s a two-game trip and Wembanyama is surely one of the reasons for that.",
      "Ticket demand was off the charts. The games sold out in a day. Some tickets remain as part of packages; for example, a game ticket for Thursday, including a chance to grab a picture with the Larry O\u2019Brien Trophy, will set you back $730. Flight not included, of course.",
      "Then again, not everyone in attendance will have bought their tickets. Wembanyama arranged a treasure hunt for 10 tickets; there were QR codes hidden in five cities \u2014 Paris, Lyon, Lille, Marseille and Bordeaux \u2014 and he encouraged fans to start hunting.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t come back to the capital without giving you the opportunity to come see me play,\u201d he wrote on social media.",
      "The Spurs are a global brand with deep ties to France that pre-date Wembanyama\u2019s arrival in San Antonio. Tony Parker and Boris Diaw helped the Spurs establish that relationship with France during their years in Spurs colors, and now the interest can be marked in plenty of ways off the court as well. Last week, the Spurs announced a series of events for this week in collaboration with Paris-Saint Germain, one of the world\u2019s most-followed soccer teams.",
      "\u201cWe have a long history with France for obvious reasons in many ways. So, it\u2019s just another milestone or opportunity, I think, to probably strengthen that bond or connection,\u201d Spurs interim coach Mitch Johnson said. \u201cVery cool for Vic. Obviously, he just got done in the Olympics as well.\u201d",
      "France played host to the Paris Games last summer and Wembanyama helped his home nation get to the gold-medal game against the U.S. He was spectacular in the final, scoring 26 points. It wasn\u2019t enough, not with Stephen Curry leading the way with 24 for the Americans \u2014 capped by a barrage of four 3-pointers in the final couple of minutes to clinch the gold.",
      "Wembanyama settled for silver that night. The games this week are in the same arena as the Olympic final was. He was asked earlier this season how often he thinks about this trip and getting to play in Paris again.",
      "\u201cAll the time,\u201d he said.",
      "Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton was on that U.S. Olympic team. He knows what that arena felt like and can envision what it\u2019ll be like for Wembanyama\u2019s return this week.",
      "\u201cThe game has never seen anybody like him,\u201d Haliburton said.",
      "The Spurs played in Miami on Sunday and lost, then stuck around for a few hours to have some dinner and get their body clocks right for the 8-hour flight from South Florida to France. The Pacers were heading to do some sightseeing after landing Monday, including the Eiffel Tower.",
      "\u201cAll that good stuff,\u201d Pacers center Myles Turner said in a video released by the team.",
      "Paris has been waiting. And Wemby will be welcomed back like a conquering hero.",
      "\u201cI think any time anybody gets to play (or) perform back home, especially when that\u2019s not something you do consistently or regularly, it\u2019s a pretty cool opportunity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m sure there\u2019ll be people at the game that haven\u2019t seen him play in a long time or typically maybe never have. You know, hometown kids get to see you \u2026 maybe they\u2019ve never been to an NBA game. So, I know there\u2019s a lot of things, not to speak for him, that I\u2019m sure he\u2019s looking forward to and that are unique in a very, very cool way for him to connect.\u201d",

      "The White Sox said on social media that Torborg \u2014 who was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease in 2010 \u2014 died in his hometown of Westfield, New Jersey. A cause of death wasn't given.",

Someone who truly understood me and gave me a chance to lead, to be a captain. So much of my way of managing and being in a clubhouse came from him.\u201d",
      "Torborg was behind the plate for three no-hitters, the first with Koufax and the Los Angeles Dodgers for the perfect game against the Chicago Cubs in 1965. Torborg had the second in 1970 with Bill Singer for the Dodgers against Philadelphia, then in 1973 with the Angels caught the first of Nolan Ryan\u2019s record seven no-hitters in a game against Kansas City.",
      "After starring at Westfield High School and Rutgers University, Torborg spent 10 seasons in the majors as player \u2014 the first seven with the Dodgers and the last three with the Angels. He hit .214 with eight homers and 101 RBIs in 574 games.",
      "He began his managing career with Cleveland in 1977 at the age of 35 and was let go in 1979. He was with the White Sox from 1989-91 and also had stints with the New York Mets (1992-93), Montreal (2000) and Florida (2002-03). He was the AL manager of the year in 1990, leading the White Sox to 94 victories.",
      "\u201cRIP Jeff Torborg!\u201d former White Sox slugger Frank Thomas said on X. \u201cYou were my first big league manager and I enjoyed playing for you. You gave me a chance to shine right away and I\u2019m very thankful. God Bless the Torborg family.\u201d",
      "Torborg was a member of the Dodgers' 1965 championship team, but didn't appear in the World Series against Minnesota.",
      "Torborg also spent time as a broadcaster.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sad day to lose a great man with such high character,\u201d said Robin Ventura, who played for Torborg from 1989-91 with Chicago. \u201cHe was a family man who ran his team like a family. I smile as I think of him in the dugout wearing his soccer cleats as he managed his team.\u201d",
      "Torborg is survived by his wife of nearly 62 years, Suzie, sons Doug, Greg and Dale, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.",

    "title": "Ichiro about to get Hall of Fame moment. For Japan, he's more than a baseball star",

    "summary": "Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he is much more than that at home in Japan",
    "story": [
      "Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he is much more than that at home in Japan",
      "TOKYO -- Ichiro Suzuki is all about baseball, but he's much more than that in Japan.",
      "Back home, he's a wellspring of national pride, much like Shohei Ohtani now. His triumphs across the Pacific buoyed the nation as Japan's economy sputtered through the so-called lost decades of the 1990s and into the 2000s.",
      "\u201cHe healed the wounds in Japan\u2019s national psyche,\u201d Kiyoteru Tsutsui, professor of sociology at Stanford University, told The Associated Press.",
      "On Tuesday, he\u2019s expected to be the first Japanese player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, and possibly only the second player chosen unanimously after New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera.",
      "Ichiro debuted in Major League Baseball in 2001 with the Seattle Mariners, the first Japanese position player to span the Pacific and an instant star. Left-handed pitcher Hideo Nomo preceded him, and Hideki Matsui came just after, both boosting the country's confidence in a period of national malaise.",
      "Tsutsui termed Ichiro a \u201cgreat cultural export,\" akin to Hello Kitty, sushi, manga and others creations from Japan.",
      "\u201cIt may not be an exaggeration to say that Ichiro represents Japan's transition from the faceless economic animal to a producer of global cultural icons,\u201d Tsutsui said.",
      "Ichiro started playing baseball at age 7 on a Little League team near Nagoya in central Japan. Sure, baseball is baseball, but the culture around the game \u2014 known as \u201cyakyu\u201d (field ball) \u2014 is special.",
      "He was driven by his father, Nobuyuki Suzuki, and came up through what is often described as a regimented baseball-training system that some link to the martial arts and even samurai history.",
      "Ichiro grew to be hip in the majors, which fit the nation\u2019s branding as \u201cCool Japan.\u201d On the way, he bumped into pressure in Japan to conform, expressed in the saying \u201cderu kugi wa utareru.\u201d",
      "Roughly in English: \u201cThe nail that sticks up gets hammered down.\u201d",
      "\u201cYoung people flocked to watch him because they saw his do-it-my-way rebel spirit,\u201d William Kelly, emeritus professor of Japanese studies at Yale University, wrote in an email. \u201cOld fans were drawn to his seriousness of purpose and his force of concentration.\u2019",
      "Ichiro developed his unique swing very early, lifting his right leg and almost running to first base before hitting the ball. Repeatedly told in Japan to change it, he declined.",
      "His given name Ichiro \u2014 \u2019ichi\u201d means \u201cone\u201d in Japanese \u2014 started appearing on the back of his jersey in 1994 with the Orix BlueWave. Suzuki is a very common family name, and manager Akira Ohgi wanted to single out Ichiro for attention.",
      "\u201cI see Ichiro as an artist, a craftsman,\u201d said Shimpei Miyagawa, an assistant professor at Temple University in Japan. \u201cThe point is that Ichiro is someone who stands out in both singular talent and longevity in a game that is ironically played as a team sport.\u201d",
      "A Japanese, Miyagawa taught high school in Massachusetts and recalls students wearing Ichiro jerseys \u2014 in the heart of Boston Red Sox country.",
      "\u201cTo me that speaks volumes about the cultural breakthrough,\u201d Miyagawa said.",
      "Ichiro's games were shown live and on tape when be began playing with the Mariners.",
      "Nomo had a similar effect when he debuted with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995. Ichiro topped that interest level, wrote Robert Whiting in his book \u201cThe Samurai Way of Baseball.\u201d",
      "\u201cIchiro was the first to appear front and center ever single day \u2014 a slender Japanese among pumped up musclemen, sparking big American teammates to victory \u2014 and the public could simply not get enough of this delectable sight,\" he wrote.",
      "Whiting wrote that few Japanese had seen much of Ichiro when he played in Japan for the BlueWave in the western city of Kobe.",
      "\u201cHis face adorned billboards all over Japan. Yet he nearly always played to half-empty stands, in games that were almost never telecast nationally.\u201d",
      "Ichiro will go into the Hall of Fame as professional baseball\u2019s all-time leader in hits with 4,367 (3,089 in MLB and 1,278 in Japan) \u2014 more even than Pete Rose's 4,256. He broke George Sisler\u2019s single-season hits mark of 257 in 2004. The new mark is 262.",
      "He played his last two games in 2019 in the Tokyo Dome against the Athletics, going 0 for 5 for the Mariners and then retiring at 45.",
      "\u201cI really wanted to play until I was 50,\u201d he said after his final game. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t do it. But it was a way of motivating myself. If I had never said that, I don\u2019t think I would have come this far.\u201d",
      "Ichiro made global news just over a year ago when he broke a window with a 426-foot home run while teaching students batting techniques at a Japanese high school.",
      "Much of Ichiro\u2019s early life is documented in the modest Ichiro Exhibition Room in his hometown of Toyoyama. It\u2019s situated in a residential area, a four-story, inconspicuous building; a shrine filled with Ichiro memorabilia.",
      "It\u2019s only open on the weekends and it\u2019s sure to become popular as this summer\u2019s Cooperstown induction nears. A marker guiding tourists to the office is graced with a silhouette of left-handed hitting Ichiro \u2014 his right leg raised as he begins his swing.",
      "Baseball was introduced into schools in Japan in 1872 by an American teacher, and many have used it to gauge the country\u2019s march toward modernization after centuries of isolation from the West.",
      "Ichiro's Hall of Fame enshrinement coincides with a surge of Japanese players shining in MLB. Ohtani is a singular talent in the history of the sport, and he was one of a dozen Japanese exports in the majors last season, including Yu Darvish, Shota Imanaga and $325 million Dodgers ace Yoshinobu Yamamoto.",
      "\u201cIchiro and Ohtani command so much respect from their peers and the public alike because they are focused on honing their crafts,\u201d Tsutsui wrote.",
      "Phenom pitcher Roki Sasaki, who announced Friday he's leaving Japan to join Ohtani on the Dodgers, continues the evolution.",
      "\u201cThe Hall of Fame vote caps that process,\u201d Tsutsui added. \u201cAnd many Japanese embrace the recognition that he is one of the greatest players to ever play in the Majors.\u201d",

Trailing by four after one, the Cardinal opened the second with Shay Ijiwoue hitting the first of two at the line and scoring at the basket to get within a point at 18-17, but Duke responded with a 14-0 run fueled by a Jordan Wood 3, a three-point play by Jackson and two layups by Delany Thomas.

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday to keep TikTok operating for 75 days, a relief to the social media platform\u2019s users even as national security questions persist.",
      "TikTok\u2019s China-based parent ByteDance was supposed to find a U.S. buyer or be banned on Jan. 19. Trump\u2019s order could give ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "\u201cI guess I have a warm spot for TikTok,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Trump has amassed nearly 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters. Yet its 170 million U.S. users could not access TikTok for more than 12 hours between Saturday night and Sunday morning.",
      "The platform went offline before the ban approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court took effect on Sunday. After Trump promised to pause the ban on Monday, TikTok restored access for existing users. Google and Apple, however, still have not reinstated TikTok to their app stores.",
      "Business leaders, lawmakers, legal scholars, and influencers who make money on TikTok are watching to see how Trump tries to resolve a thicket of regulatory, legal, financial and geopolitical issues with his signature.",
      "TikTok's app allows users to create and watch short-form videos, and broke new ground by operating with an algorithm that fed viewers recommendations based on their viewing habits. But concerns about its potential to serve as a tool for Beijing to manipulate and spy on Americans pre-date Trump's first presidency.",
      "In 2020, Trump issued executive orders banning dealings with ByteDance and the owners of the Chinese messaging app WeChat. Courts ended up blocking the orders, but less than a year ago Congress overwhelmingly passed a law citing national security concerns to ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold it to an approved buyer.",
      "The law, which went into force Sunday, allows for fines of up to $5,000 per U.S. TikTok user against major mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services like Oracle if they continued to distribute TikTok to U.S. users beyond the deadline for ByteDance's divestment.",
      "Trump on Sunday said he had asked TikTok's U.S. service providers to continue supporting the platform and app while he prepared to sign an executive order to stop the ban for now.",
      "\u201cThe order will also confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order,\u201d Trump posted on Truth Social, his social networking site.",
      "The law that Congress passed and now-former President Joe Biden signed in April allowed for a 90-day extension if there had been progress toward a sale before the statute's effective date. Less certain is whether that provision can be applied retroactively, according to Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "\u201cExecutive orders cannot override existing laws,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear that the new president has that authority to issue the 90-day extension of a law that\u2019s already gone into effect.\u201d",
      "Kreps also doubts the conditions for a delay exist at this point without so much as even a potential buyer being named to prove that a sale was moving along.",
      "But Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor, has written that the law also empowers the president to decide what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture\u201d \u2014 suggesting Trump could have discretion to say whether or when ByteDance meets the terms of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.",
      "Although ByteDance spent months repeating it wasn't interested in selling, Beijing on Monday also signaled a possible easing on China's stance on TikTok to allow it to be divested from its Chinese parent company. China\u2019s vice president held meetings with Vice President JD Vance and Tesla tech titan Elon Musk on Sunday.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, said Monday that business operations and acquisitions \u201cshould be independently decided by companies in accordance with market principles.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf it involves Chinese companies, China\u2019s laws and regulations should be observed,\u201d Mao said.",
      "Until now, it was widely believed that Beijing would not allow the sale of TikTok, which had come to embody China\u2019s defiance in the face of \u201cU.S. robbery.\u201d However, TikTok was among several issues brought up in a phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump on Friday, though details were not available.",
      "Trump later announced plans to delay the TikTok ban and suggested a joint venture in which the U.S. would get a 50% ownership of the app. Shou Zi Chew, TikTok\u2019s CEO, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration, seated with American tech heavyweights.",
      "The Justice Department is generally tasked with enforcing the laws of the federal government, so it\u2019s possible that Trump will direct the DOJ to ignore the law. Such a move might itself be subject to legal scrutiny but would buy time for TikTok.",
      "Trump\u2019s efforts to save TikTok may put him at odds with some of the House members and senators who voted for the law, which received broad bipartisan support. House Speaker Mike Johnson called ByteDance's ownership \u201ca very dangerous thing,\u201d and said he expected a full sale to happen.",
      "\u201cI think we will enforce the law,\u201d Johnson told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday.",
      "Legislators now stand to \u201clook a little bit silly\u201d if the ban doesn\u2019t last, Kreps said.",
      "\u201c(The case) becomes about the separations of powers, and checks and balances, that we don\u2019t have a king who decides what happens with the law,\u201d Kreps said. \u201cEnforcement isn\u2019t only up to the executive branch.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, in a message posted on X, listed a number of state and federal agencies, and private entities, that might be willing to go to court to get the ban enforced.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d Cotton noted.",
      "Despite the intense scrutiny and potential costs involved, the machinations over TikTok are in some ways just business as usual for the tech companies involved, according to Gus Hurwitz, a legal scholar with the International Center for Law and Economics.",
      "\u201cThe fines that we\u2019re talking about are civil penalties and companies risk civil penalties all the time,\u201d Hurwitz said.",
      "Still, the hard business calculus of complying with a law in limbo or risk defying a president who holds lucrative federal contracts over those companies could come into focus if shareholders sue.",
      "Oracle, for example, has a part of the Pentagon\u2019s $9 billion contract to build its cloud computing network.",
      "\u201cThis actually could be the right business decision to make,\u201d Hurwitz said. \u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily a breach of duty to shareholders.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s been lots of questions about how companies such as Oracle and Akamai Technologies are powering TikTok\u2019s servers to stay online, while others such as Apple and Google have made the app unavailable for new users to download.",
      "None of the companies have responded to requests for comment.",
      "Oracle in 2020 announced it had a 12.5% stake in TikTok Global after securing its business as the app\u2019s cloud technology provider.",
      "Meanwhile, as of Monday night, a search for TikTok on Apple\u2019s app store directs to an online statement that reads in part: \u201cApple is obligated to follow the laws in the jurisdictions where it operates,\u201d while Google\u2019s app store notes downloads for TikTok \u201care paused due to current US legal requirements.\u201d",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The bitcoin-friendly administration of President-elect Donald Trump and an expanding lobbying effort in statehouses could push states to become more open to crypto and lead public pension funds and treasuries to buy into it.",
      "Proponents of the uniquely volatile commodity argue it is a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.",
      "Many bitcoin enthusiasts and investors are quick to say government-backed currencies are prone to devaluation and increased government buy-ins will stabilize future price swings, giving them more legitimacy and boosting already rising prices.",
      "But the risks are significant. Critics say crypto investments are highly speculative, with so much unknown about projecting future returns. They warn that investors should be prepared to lose money.",
      "Only a couple of public pension funds have invested in cryptocurrency. A U.S. Government Accountability Office study on 401(k) plan investments in crypto, issued late last year, warned it has \u201cuniquely high volatility.\u201d It found no standard approach for projecting the future returns of crypto.",
      "2024 was a landmark year for crypto, with bitcoin surpassing $100,000. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. Now, crypto enthusiasts are banking on Trump's promise to make the United States the \u201cbitcoin superpower\u201d of the world.",
      "Lawmakers in more states can expect to see bills this year to make them crypto-friendly. Analysts say crypto is becoming a powerful lobby. Bitcoin miners are building new installations and venture capitalists are underwriting a growing tech sector that caters to cryptocurrencies.",
      "Meanwhile, a new crypto-friendly federal government under Trump and Congress could consider legislation from Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyoming, to create a federal bitcoin reserve on which states can piggyback.",
      "A bill introduced in November in Pennsylvania's House of Representatives sought to authorize the state's treasurer and public pension funds to invest in bitcoin. It went nowhere before the legislative session ended, but it caused a stir.",
      "\u201cI had a friend who is a rep down the road text me, \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019m getting so many emails and phone calls to my office,' more than he ever did about any other bill,\u201d said the measure's sponsor, Republican Mike Cabell.",

      "Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, said he doesn\u2019t expect many public pension fund investment professionals, who oversee nearly $6 trillion in assets, to invest in crypto.",
      "Pension fund professionals take risks they deem to be appropriate, but bitcoin investing has a short track record, might only fit into a niche asset class and may not fit the risk-to-reward profile they seek.",
      "\u201cThere might be a bit of dabbling in bitcoin,\u201d Brainard said. \u201cBut it\u2019s difficult to envision a scenario in which pension funds right now are willing to make a commitment.\u201d",
      "Louisiana Treasurer John Fleming helped make the state the first to introduce a system allowing people to pay a government agency in cryptocurrencies.",
      "Fleming said he's not trying to promote cryptocurrency, but rather views it as a recognition that the government must innovate and be flexible about helping people do business with the state. He said he would never invest his money, or the state's, in crypto.",
      "\u201cMy concern is that at some point it\u2019ll stop growing and then people will want to cash in,\u201d Fleming said. \u201cAnd when they do, it could tank the value of a bitcoin.\u201d",

      "Still, a highly volatile asset is ill-suited to the agency's need for predictability, considering it writes millions of checks a year. The overwhelming majority of the roughly $60 billion it invests at any given time is in short-term, conservative investments designed for an investment period of months, officials there said.",
      "Pension boards, which invest on a 30-year time horizon, may already hold small investments in companies involved in mining, trading and storing cryptocurrencies. But they have been slow to embrace bitcoin.",
      "That could change, said Mark Palmer, managing director and a senior research analyst at The Benchmark Company in New York.",
      "Pension boards got investment tools they like last year when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approved the first exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin. In October, it approved listings of options on those funds, Palmer said.",

      "During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed threats to U.S. national security",
      "NEW YORK -- During his first term as president, Donald Trump led the effort to ban TikTok, the hugely popular video-sharing site he said posed a threat to U.S. national security. But on the eve of his return to the White House, the president-elect is being hailed as the app's savior.",
      "After going dark for users this weekend, Trump said on his social media site that he would issue an executive order after he's sworn in for a second term on Monday delaying a TikTok ban \u201cso that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\u201d He said the order would make clear that companies will not be held liable for violating a law that aimed to force TikTok's sale by its China-based parent company. Hours later, the app returned, to the relief of its legions of dedicated users.",
      "\u201cThanks for your patience and support. As a result of President Trump's efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.!\" read the announcement.",
      "Trump's legal authority to unilaterally decide not to enforce the law, which passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in April and was upheld by the Supreme Court on Friday, is unclear. But the rapid developments over the weekend served as a reminder of how dramatically debates over technology, social media and national security have changed since Trump was last in the White House. It also signaled how closely Trump is following those shifts after waging a successful campaign in which he made inroads with voters in part by harnessing the appeal of some social media platforms.",
      "Trump can now take credit for reviving an app with 170 million users that is especially popular with younger Americans, many of whom spend hours a day on the platform to get news, make money and find entertainment.",
      "\u201cThis is one of those things where the domestic politics has become so upside down and crazy that it turns out there\u2019s only upside for Trump now,\u201d said Bill Bishop, a China expert who has been closely following the back-and-forth. If the bans ends up being enforced, he said, Trump will say it was on outgoing President Joe Biden\u2019s watch. \u201cAnd if it does come back then Trump is a savior. And he will be rewarded both by users\u201d as well as the company, which he said is now \u201cbeholden to Trump\u201d and will have an incentive to make sure content on the platform is favorable to him.",
      "TikTok\u2019s move comes as tech companies and CEOs have been been working furiously to improve their standing with Trump. X owner and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has enjoyed unprecedented access to the president-elect after spending more than $200 million and personally campaigning to help him get elected.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and reshaped his social media platforms\u2019 policies to align more closely with Trump\u2019s worldview earlier this month, ending third-party fact-checking, loosening rules against hate speech, ending his company\u2019s diversity and equity policies and naming Dana White, the president and CEO of Ultimate Fighting Championship and a familiar figure in Trump\u2019s orbit, to its board.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Amazon, Meta and Google have all pledged to donate $1 million each to Trump\u2019s inaugural fund.",
      "The companies have a lot on the line, including regulatory challenges. Although federal regulators began cracking down on Google and Facebook during Trump\u2019s first term as president \u2014 and flourished under Biden \u2014 most experts expect his second administration to ease up on antitrust enforcement and be more receptive to business mergers.",
      "TikTok also worked to curry Trump's favor, with CEO Shou Chew meeting with him at Mar-a-Lago in December. In a video responding to the Supreme Court decision, Chew was careful to praise Trump and cast the app's fate as dependent on him.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of everyone at TikTok and all our users across the country, I want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform.\"",
      "When the app went dark, it had initially posted a simple message informing users of the change, but later updated the language to include Trump.",
      "\u201cSorry, TikTok isn\u2019t available right now,\u201d it read. \u201cA law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can\u2019t use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\u201d",
      "The federal law had required TikTok parent company ByteDance to cut ties with the platform\u2019s U.S. operations by Sunday. The Biden administration had stressed in recent days that it did not intend to enforce the ban before Trump took office. But TikTok said it would nonetheless \u201cgo dark\u201d because the Biden administration had not provided \u201cnecessary clarity and assurance\u201d to service providers \u2014 a stance outgoing Deputy National Security Adviser Jon Finer cast as disingenuous.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it doesn\u2019t feel completely on the level,\u201d he said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\" \u201cI think we were extremely clear that there was no need to take this action,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump said in an interview with NBC News on Saturday that he was considering granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to sell. ByteDance has repeatedly refused to sell, but the company is being eyed by investors including Trump\u2019s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt.",
      "Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute, said there was no evidence ByteDance had made any meaningful progress toward divestiture, \u201cso I don\u2019t see how, by any measure, it would legally meet those conditions.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther, an Executive Order cannot legally override or cancel a law that Congress passed,\u201d she said. \"Laws enacted through the legislative process have a higher legal standing and an EO that conflicts with the existing law, the law takes precedence and the EO would likely be struck down by the courts.\u201d",
      "Sen. Tom Cotton, the Republican chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, warned Sunday that there is no legal basis for the kind of extension Trump is pursuing.",
      "\u201cAny company that hosts, distributes, services, or otherwise facilitates communist-controlled TikTok could face hundreds of billions of dollars of ruinous liability under the law, not just from DOJ, but also under securities law, shareholder lawsuits, and state AGs,\u201d he wrote on X. \u201cThink about it.\u201d",
      "Trump, in his Sunday post, proposed new terms of a deal in which he said the United States would have \u201ca 50% ownership position in a joint venture\u201d that would be \"set up between the U.S. and whichever purchase we so choose.\u201d But the details remained murky and it was unclear whether Trump was proposing control by the U.S. government or another company. Trump did not elaborate during a rally Sunday night, where he hailed the move.",
      "\u201cAs of today, TikTok is back,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have no choice. We have to save it.\u201d",
      "Though Trump sought to ban TikTok during his first term, he reversed that stance during his 2024 campaign, when he came to believe a ban would help the app's rival, Facebook, which he held responsible, in part, to his 2020 election loss to Biden.",
      "Trump ended up joining the app last year and has grown his following to nearly 15 million users. He has since credited the app for helping him win over young voters.",
      "\u201cI have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\u201d he said during a December news conference. \u201cTikTok had an impact.\u201d",

      "\u201cKnow your blood pressure, know the numbers,\u201d stressed Dr. Randy Zusman of Massachusetts General Hospital, who specializes in the hardest-to-treat cases and advises people who think they\u2019re fine to at least get a yearly check.",
      "And only a fraction of patients have their hypertension well-controlled, meaning there\u2019s a need for novel strategies. The Food and Drug Administration approved that \u201crenal denervation\u201d option about a year ago, based on studies showing a modest benefit in patients whose blood pressure remains high despite multiple medicines.",
      "Now, after the American Heart Association recently deemed it promising, some hospitals including Mass General Brigham are cautiously offering it as they work out who are good candidates \u2014 and whether their insurance will cover a minimally invasive procedure costing thousands of dollars.",
      "Two numbers describe blood pressure. The top, \u201csystolic\u201d pressure, is the force blood puts on the walls of arteries as its pumped out of the heart. The bottom \u201cdiastolic\u201d number measures that same pressure but between heartbeats.",
      "Normal is less than 120 over 80. Blood pressure naturally fluctuates throughout the day, higher when you\u2019re physically active or stressed. But when it stays high \u2014 consistently 130 over 80 or higher, according to the most recent guidelines \u2014 it stiffens arteries and makes the heart work harder.",
      "It doesn\u2019t take a doctor\u2019s visit. Pharmacies and sometimes even libraries offer screening, and people can use at-home monitors.",
      "To avoid falsely high readings, the American Medical Association has tips: Sit quietly with feet on the floor, legs not crossed. Place the cuff on a bare arm, not over clothing. Don\u2019t dangle the arm \u2014 rest it on a table.",
      "Lifestyle changes are the first step, especially for otherwise healthy people. Guidelines urge losing weight, exercise, eating more fruits and vegetables, limiting salt and alcohol, and taking steps to handle stress.",
      "Medicine is a must once hypertension reaches 140 over 90. The average patient requires two or three drugs, sometimes more, along with healthier living, Zusman said.",
      "But the hypertension Garrity has struggled with since his late 20s is treatment-resistant. Despite taking four to six drugs plus a strict diet and exercise, his blood pressure regularly reached 150 over 100 or worse.",
      "Doctors thread a small catheter, or tube, through blood vessels to reach the kidneys, and then beam in ultrasound or radiofrequency energy. Those pulses pass through the renal arteries to selectively target surrounding nerves, said Dr. Joseph Garasic, a Mass General interventional cardiologist who performed Garrity\u2019s procedure. It takes about an hour.",
      "Although already used in other countries, a key U.S. trial of renal denervation failed about a decade ago, prompting changes before researchers tried again. In November 2023, the FDA approved two catheter systems, from Recor Medical and Medtronic.",
      "It\u2019s not a cure \u2013 and some patients get no benefit. But Garasic said multiple studies show on average an 8 to 10-point drop in blood pressure, a modest but important improvement. Some like Garrity see a bigger drop, enough to gradually scale back medications.",
      "The FDA deemed the procedure safe for carefully chosen patients \u2014 it wasn\u2019t tested in those with kidney disease or narrowed arteries, for example. And studies have lasted only a few years, not long enough to tell if the nerves might eventually regenerate.",
      "Guidance from the American Heart Association urges would-be patients and experienced doctors to have \u201cthoughtful and informed discussions\u201d to decide who\u2019s a good candidate.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 10:02:24 -0500",

      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles versus those still standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world",
      "Emails and videos of burned buildings in Los Angeles next to those left standing have been flying back and forth among architects, builders and fire safety specialists around the world.",
      "For many homeowners, like Enrique Balcazar, the sometimes scattershot nature of the carnage can seem like random chance. Balcazar, a real estate agent, posted video that showed little more than chimneys remaining of most homes on his block after fire leapt through his Altadena neighborhood. Balcazar stood on his neighbor's destroyed classic Mustang to douse his smoldering roof, but his home was otherwise fine.",
      "\u201cIt's an older house and it still has the old wood sidings,\u201d Balcazar said. \u201cTo me there's nothing explainable in logical or scientific reason of why my house would not have burned.\u201d",
      "Many experts say luck does play a part. After all, wind can shift 180 degrees in a split second, pushing fire away from your house and towards a neighbor's. But they also say there are many ways that homes can be made less vulnerable to fire.",
      "\u201cBecause there are, say, 50 ways a fire can burn your house,\" said Greg Faulkner of Faulkner Architects in California, who has focused on less combustible home exteriors for more than a decade. \u201cIf you eliminate half of those, or three-quarters of them, that\u2019s not luck, that\u2019s increasing your odds.\u201d",
      "People in fire country generally know that trees, landscaping and wood fences near homes can be a fire risk. Architects and contractors are going beyond that, using newer materials and techniques in roofing, walls and windows to keep buildings standing. The measures do add cost to the homes \u2014 around 3% to 6%, Faulkner said, or as much as 10% for the most robust protection.",
      "Many of these experts no longer use wood siding. Where it is used, or still allowed, it needs to have a fire-resistant barrier underneath, often made of gypsum, the same material used to make drywall. That way if the wood catches fire, it takes longer for the heat to reach inside the home",
      "But even with that, you\u2019re still putting a combustible material on the building, said Richard Schuh, with Nielsen : Schuh Architects. \u201cSo that would be something we would avoid. Use of fire-resistant materials is critical.\u201d",
      "Stucco, a cement material, is a common exterior for Southern California houses and it's fire-resistant. Reviewing AP photographs showing buildings still standing, Arnold Tarling, who has four decades experience in fire protection and building inspection in Britain, said houses with stucco walls appeared to survive the Los Angeles fires better. Yet if more of them had had a layer of gypsum beneath the stucco, it would have given more protection from the heat, he said.",
      "Windows are a huge factor in whether a home burns down, because so much heat is transmitted through them. Double-pane windows significantly slow heat coming from the burning building next door.",
      "\u201cThe outside layer protects the inside layer until it fails,\u201d said Schuh. Codes in many places require one of the two panes to be tempered, which is much more resistant to heat than conventional glass, he said.",
      "Tarling noted one intact Malibu beachfront home, surrounded by gutted buildings. He speculated that the fact that no windows faced a neighbor helped protect it because radiated heat couldn\u2019t penetrate as easily.",
      "In his buildings, Faulkner builds in fire shutters that can slide closed and cover the windows.",
      "Then there's the roof \u2014 a convenient landing pad for fire embers.",
      "Simpler roof lines can allow red-hot embers to slide off. Spanish Mission, for example, is an iconic Los Angeles style \u2014 part of what says \u201cHollywood\u201d in movies about the city, for example, as well as a reminder of its Mexican and Spanish history. That style doesn\u2019t always have simple roof lines \u2014 the knee walls that are common on Mission-style roofs create corners.",
      "\u201cThe embers could, just like snow, gather in that corner,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "Many roofs in the U.S. are covered in asphalt. Areas that are designated as wildfire-prone in California \u2013 an ever-growing area \u2013 are required to use roofing that delays the transfer of heat to the inside of the building, called one-hour or Class A.",
      "Still, asphalt is a petroleum product. Some building professionals prefer metal, which doesn\u2019t burn. Metal has its own downside, though: It conducts heat. Putting a layer of gypsum under a metal roof is becoming a common practice in some areas.",
      "Maybe as important as which material is used on a roof is whether the roof offers fire a way to get in. Here, as in so many tradeoffs, one effort to do good conflicts with another: Contractors have been more careful over the years to make sure moisture doesn't build up in attics by making sure air circulates, using those vents that are visible on many roofs or under eaves.",
      "But in a powerful fire, Schuh says, \u201cif you\u2019re on the side where the wind is putting pressure against the house, it\u2019s also blowing the flames into the house like a blow torch,\u201d and fire gets in through the vents.",
      "On the other side of the house, it can create a vacuum, several experts said, sucking fire in.",
      "But you can\u2019t easily just eliminate roof ventilation because it will cause moisture problems, said Cesar Martin Gomez, an architect at the University of Navarra, Spain, who\u2019s worked for 25 years in building services.",
      "Faulkner said in some buildings he's eliminating the need for ventilation in the roof structure by sealing the spaces. Schuh is using a cover on roof vents that can actually respond to fire with a mesh that closes.",
      "Martin Gomez noted that in some parts of Australia, new homes are required to have water tanks. \u201cIf each home has the ability to protect itself, fire won\u2019t be able to spread as much,\u201d he said.",
      "And some homes in the U.S. are now built with sprinkler systems for the outside of the house, not just the inside. It sprays water with a soapy solution to make it flow over the surface of the building, Schuh said.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re adding one more layer of protection to your building, and that\u2019s more of a priority now than ever because your insurance company may or not be around for you,\u201d he said.",

      "With President-elect Donald Trump adding uncertainty around whether a TikTok ban will go into effect, the focus is now turning to companies like Google and Apple that are expected to take the popular video sharing app off their platforms in just two days.",
      "Though the Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld a federal law that could ban TikTok nationwide, it\u2019s unclear how a shutdown of the popular social media platform will play out and what Americans will see when the clock strikes midnight on Sunday.",
      "The court decision comes against a backdrop of unusual political agitation by Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution after he takes office, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won\u2019t enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Now, tech observers \u2014 and some users \u2014 are intently watching to see what happens over the weekend and beyond.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really in uncharted territory here in terms of tech policy,\u201d said Sarak Kreps, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Tech Policy Institute.",
      "Under the law, mobile app stores \u2014 like the ones operated by Apple and Google \u2014 and internet hosting services will face major fines if they continue to distribute the platform to U.S. users beyond the deadline for divestment from ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s China-based parent company. The companies could pay up to $5,000 for each user who continues to access TikTok, meaning penalties could total to a large sum.",
      "A lawyer representing TikTok told Supreme Court justices last week that the platform will \u201cgo dark\u201d on Jan. 19 if the law isn\u2019t struck down. But TikTok, which is not required to block its own platform under the statute, has not said whether it will limit access to the app, or its website, on Sunday. Experts have noted TikTok\u2019s app should remain available for current users, but existing ones will no longer be able to update it, making it unusable in the long term.",
      "Trump\u2019s national security adviser has signaled this week that the incoming administration may take steps to \u201ckeep TikTok from going dark,\u201d though what that looks like \u2014 and if any of those steps can withhold legal scrutiny \u2014 remains unclear.",
      "\u201cMy decision on TikTok will be made in the not-too-distant future, but I must have time to review the situation,\u201d Trump said Friday in a post on Truth Social after the court\u2019s ruling. Earlier in the day, he said in another post that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "In the meantime, some of the attention has turned to tech companies, such as Apple, Google and Oracle, who currently offer TikTok on their app stores or host company data on their servers.",
      "Tech CEOs have been attempting to forge friendlier ties with Trump, who wants to put the TikTok ban on hold, since he was elected in November. But Kreps said it would \u201cdefy credulity\u201d for them to continue to offer TikTok, even if they want to please Trump, since it would open them up to punitive fines.",
      "Tech companies are also used to removing apps at the behest of governments. In 2023, Apple says it removed nearly 1,500 apps globally. Nearly 1,300 of the apps were taken down in China.",
      "\u201cPenalties for companies like Apple and Google could run as high as $850 billion,\u201d Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X on Thursday, while referring to the U.S. TikTok law. \u201cNot sure I\u2019d take a politician\u2019s word if I ran those companies.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, said he believes there\u2019s a \u201csmall chance\u201d that nothing happens to TikTok, but acknowledged that would require \u201cenormous risk on the on the part of the companies that support them.\u201d",
      "Apple, Google and Oracle did not respond to questions sent this week about their plans on TikTok.",
      "In a video after the court ruling, TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is expected to attend Trump\u2019s inauguration and be granted a prime seating location on the dais, thanked the president-elect for \u201chis commitment to work\u201d with TikTok to \u201cfind a solution\u201d that keeps the platform available.",

      "Earlier this week, TikTok told its U.S. employees that its offices would remain open for work even if the \u201csituation\u201d won\u2019t be resolved by Sunday.

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. is inching closer and closer to a potential TikTok ban \u2014 with the nation's highest court upholding a law that's set to halt new downloads of the app starting Sunday. But many questions around what exactly this ban will look like, and whether it will actually be enforced, remain.",
      "That puts millions of users and content creators in limbo \u2014 particularly influencers and small business owners who have come to rely on the mega-popular social media platform as a source of income.",
      "Among those individuals is Terrell Wade, a comedian, actor and content creator with 1.5 million followers on TikTok under the handle @TheWadeEmpire. Wade, who has turned his TikTok presence into a full-time job, said he expects \u201ctwo days of chaos\u201d as the Sunday deadline nears.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I really don\u2019t know what to believe,\u201d Wade told The Associated Press.",
      "In a unanimous decision on Friday, the Supreme Court upheld a federal law that will ban TikTok unless it\u2019s sold by its China-based parent company before Jan. 19 \u2014 ruling that a risk to national security posed by the platform's ties to China overcomes First Amendment concerns about limiting free speech on and by the app.",
      "A sale does not appear imminent, meaning the ban should go into effect Sunday. But the ruling also arrives just days before the inauguration of a new president.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration has maintained that TikTok must change its ownership to address national security concerns, but signaled that it won't enforce the law on Sunday, the Democrat's final full day in office. On Friday, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that actions to enforce the law will fall to the new administration due to \u201cthe sheer fact of timing.\" Meanwhile, Republican President-elect Donald Trump, who once also tried to ban TikTok, has now vowed to preserve access to the platform. But what his options will be following Monday's inauguration remains unclear.",
      "Among other points of confusion is what a ban on TikTok will look like. Experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users\u2019 devices once the law takes effect. But new users won\u2019t be able to download it and updates will not be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department said in court filings.",
      "All of this is \u201ca reminder to the creator community that social media platforms can come and go,\u201d notes Kelsey Chickering, a principal analyst at Forrester, stressing the disruptions TikTok creators and influencers will feel if the ban takes effect. If access is lost, she adds, many will have to pivot and re-build their presence on other platforms.",
      "While bracing for a potential Sunday ban, Wade is among creators who hope that something happens to avert the shutdown, although he thinks he has enough followers on other platforms to stay afloat.",

      "Ok was also among influencers who TikTok brought to Washington in 2023 to lobby for the preservation of the app, and remembers a ban being discussed as far back as 2020. And as someone who is Asian, the efforts to ban TikTok over the years have also felt \u201ca little xenophobic,\u201d she added.",

I\u2019m disappointed,\" Ok said. \"It\u2019s a beautiful app, it\u2019s brought so many people together, it\u2019s changed a lot of people\u2019s lives, and for it to just be taken away like that feels ... so not American.\u201d",
      "Jordan Smith, a former WNBA player who operates The Elevated Closet in Austin, Texas \u2014 a clothing brand for tall women \u2014 depends on TikTok and TikTok Shop to find customers that fit her niche demographic that\u2019s difficult to specifically market to otherwise.",
      "\u201cOn TikTok I\u2019ve just been able to find that audience so much easier,\u201d she said.",

      "DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- Sebastian Ray Serpa, a 16-year-old high school student from Volusia County, passes by Daytona International Speedway often and hears the roar of race cars from outside the gates but had never before been inside the \u201cWorld Center of Racing.\u201d",
      "After an immersive experience Friday designed for talented STEM students, Ray Serpa \u201cwill definitely\u201d be returning for next week's Rolex 24 at Daytona \u2014 his first ever motorsports event.",
      "IMSA arranged for 27 high school students who excel in STEM programs to come to the speedway to educate the teens on how many opportunities exist in motorsports for those interested in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.",
      "Ray Serpa, who described himself as passionate about mechanical engineering, was blown away. He thought he'd like a future learning about how the human joint works. After stops at four different stations and a tour of the speedway and cars, he's now aware motorsports is an option.",
      "\u201cThis has been a real eye-opener for me,\u201d he told The Associated Press. \u201cI knew that behind almost every concept out there there were opportunities, but I never realized how wide that actually went. There are so many applications that require STEM skills. I heard from marketing people who went to school for mechanical engineering, and then ended up getting greater satisfaction from marketing. Or, they still work hand-in-hand. I would really like to get to a point where I can say the same.\u201d",
      "It is the debut year for the program in IMSA sports car racing, but series president John Doonan ran a similar STEM experience when he was head of Mazda. It took sponsorship from Gainbridge, Konica Minolta and EVERFi, which is working to develop the curriculum to continue the program, to launch it in IMSA.",
      "The students made four stops at the track: Tires, Traction and Tread to learn about physics and engineering at the Michelin Tire Center; Data-Driven Racing at the IMSA Engineering Center to learn about data, science and technology; Engineering Safety at IMSA Tech Inspection Area to learn about material science; and IMSA Technology Lab, with the IMSA GTP Hybrid Electrified Race Car, at Action Express Racing to learn about physics and engineering.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing here is a laboratory. It\u2019s a laboratory for the automakers. It\u2019s a laboratory for Michelin on the tire front. It\u2019s a laboratory for all these teams,\u201d Doonan said. \"For the students to be able to see what they\u2019re doing in the classroom, be applied in a real-world environment, that gives me and all of my IMSA teammates a lot of satisfaction.",
      "\"These students here, some of the top students from the Volusia County schools surrounding the Daytona area, they\u2019re our future. We are going to do it at five other races this year and then have a web portal to allow the educators and students to follow up. For me it\u2019s the best of both worlds.\u201d",
      "Doonan in his morning remarks to the students tried to prep them for what they were about to learn concerning STEM and motorsports.",
      "\u201cI told them, \u2018Look, algebra, calculus, physics, chemistry, as much as you may dislike it at the moment, it\u2019s being applied here real-time,\u2019\u201d Doonan said. \u201cAnd when you say that to the students, the teachers all raise their hand and cheer and tell them \u2018I told you so!\u2019 And then the opposite side, I think, once the web portal gets established by EVERFI, the teachers are going to be able to leverage this resource in story problems and race strategy and aerodynamics, potentially, ride height, all the things that the teams are doing.\u201d",
      "Amy Monahan, a K-12 STEM Specialist for Volusia County Schools, said the students who attended were selected by their teachers for \u201cshowing tenacity in what they do on a daily basis.\u201d One of the students said prior to Friday he'd been thinking of enlisting in the military after high school but now wonders if there might be something in motorsports he can pursue.",
      "\u201cThis whole program is educating them to many opportunities are out there and this one is in your backyard. Some of them think the military or trade jobs are all that is available to them,\" Monahan said. \u201cThey don't know. Most of them have never been to a race, so seeing this and what it looks like, and understanding there are plenty of things to pursue is just a wonderful gift for them.\u201d",

      "Disabled people make up about 3% of the science, technology, engineering and math workforce, according to 2021 data from the National Science Foundation.",
      "Scientists with disabilities say that\u2019s in part because labs, classrooms and field sites aren\u2019t designed to accommodate them. Students and faculty are still told that they can\u2019t work in a lab or do research safely, said Mark Leddy, who formerly managed disability-related grants for the National Science Foundation.",

      "At Purdue University in Indiana, engineering professor Brad Duerstock helped design an accessible biomedical lab years ago with support from the school and a National Institutes of Health grant, removing cabinets under sinks and fume hoods so that wheelchairs can easily pull up.",
      "The cost of making a lab more accessible varies depending on how extensive the changes are, Duerstock said. Some schools set aside money for improvements and science organizations can offer grants.",
      "On the California geology field trip, the group explored the lake carved into the landscape by the San Andreas Fault, where the grating of two tectonic plates can cause earthquakes.",
      "The group included rock enthusiasts at all different stages of their careers. A handful were students. Others were professors, eager to explore the outdoors in a group they could trust to look after them.",

      "Scientists are unraveling the mystery of what triggers Huntington\u2019s disease, a devastating and fatal hereditary disorder that strikes in the prime of life, causing nerve cells in parts of the brain to break down and die.",
      "The genetic mutation linked to Huntington's has long been known, but scientists haven't understood how people could have the mutation from birth, but not develop any problems until later in life.",
      "New research shows that the mutation is, surprisingly, harmless for decades. But it quietly grows into a larger mutation \u2014 until it eventually crosses a threshold, generates toxic proteins, and kills the cells it has expanded in.",
      "\u201cThe conundrum in our field has been: Why do you have a genetic disorder that manifests later in life if the gene is present at conception?\u201d said Dr. Mark Mehler, who directs the Institute for Brain Disorders and Neural Regeneration at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and was not involved in the research. He called the research a \u201clandmark\u201d study and said \"it addresses a lot of the issues that have plagued the field for a long time.\u201d",
      "The brain cell death eventually leads to problems with movement, thinking and behavior. Huntington\u2019s symptoms \u2013 which include involuntary movement, unsteady gait, personality changes and impaired judgment \u2013 typically begin between the ages of 30 and 50, gradually worsening over 10 to 25 years.",
      "Scientists at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, McLean Hospital in Massachusetts and Harvard Medical School studied brain tissue donated by 53 people with Huntington\u2019s and 50 without it, analyzing half a million cells.",
      "They focused on the Huntington\u2019s mutation, which involves a stretch of DNA in a particular gene where a three-letter sequence \u2013 CAG \u2013 is repeated at least 40 times. In people without the disease this sequence is repeated just 15 to 35 times. They discovered that DNA tracts with 40 or more such \u201crepeats\u201d expand over time until they are hundreds of CAGs long. Once CAGs reach a threshold of about 150, certain types of neurons sicken and die.",
      "The findings \u201cwere really surprising, even to us,\u201d said Steve McCarroll, a Broad member and co-senior author of the study, which was published Thursday in the journal Cell. The study was partly funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, an organization that also supports The Associated Press Health and Science department.",
      "The research team estimated that repeat tracts grow slowly during the first two decades of life, then the rate accelerates dramatically when they reach about 80 CAGs.",
      "\u201cThe longer the repeats, the earlier in life the onset will happen,\u201d said neuroscience researcher Sabina Berretta, one of the study's senior authors.",
      "Researchers acknowledged that some scientists were initially skeptical when results were shared at conferences, since previous work found that repeat expansions in the range of 30 to 100 CAGs were necessary \u2014 but not sufficient \u2014 to cause Huntington\u2019s. McCarroll agreed that 100 or fewer CAGs are not sufficient to trigger the disease, but said his study found that expansions with at least 150 CAGs are.",
      "Researchers hope their findings can help scientists come up with ways to delay or prevent the incurable condition, which afflicts about 41,000 Americans and is now treated with medications to manage the symptoms.",
      "Recently, experimental drugs designed to lower levels of the protein produced by the mutated Huntington's gene have struggled in trials. The new findings suggest that's because few cells have the toxic version of the protein at any given time.",
      "Slowing or stopping the expansion of DNA repeats may be a better way to target the disease, researchers said.",
      "Though there are no guarantees this would stave off Huntington\u2019s, McCarroll said \u201cmany companies are starting or expanding programs to try to do this.\u201d",

Ohio State University also announced plans in 2023 to build a $110 million software innovation center to dovetail with those efforts.",
      "At separate upcoming state meetings, the Anduril project will pursue a job creation tax credit from the Ohio Department of Development and a $70 million infusion from the All Ohio Future Fund, which the DeWine administration and lawmakers established to help local governments prepare sites for economic development projects. JobsOhio also plans to provide the project a sizeable grant, whose exact amount will be announced once agreements are signed, as well as talent acquisition services.",

      "HONG KONG -- Taiwan computer chip maker TSMC reported Thursday that its profit in the last quarter rose 57%, buoyed by the artificial intelligence boom.",
      "The world\u2019s biggest semiconductor manufacturer reported a net profit of 374.7 billion new Taiwan dollars ($11.4 billion), higher than expected.",
      "Last week, the company, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., reported that its revenue for 2024 rose almost 34% to 2.9 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($88 billion). Revenue for the fourth quarter rose 38.8% to 868.46 billion new Taiwan dollars ($26.4 billion), also higher than forecasts.",

      "The U.S. said this week that it would further restrict exports of chips used for AI and other advanced technology, seeking to limit China's access. The new rules cap the number of AI chips that can be exported to most countries, although about 20 close allies including Taiwan will have unlimited access to U.S. AI technology.",
      "The regulations however could impact demand for AI chips from chipmakers like TSMC.",
      "The Taiwanese chipmaker has plans to open three factories in the U.S. and two more in Japan. Both the Japanese and U.S. governments are offering billions in funding and subsidies to TSMC to boost domestic chip production.",

      "Blue Origin has launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) \u2014 Blue Origin launched its massive new rocket on its first test flight Thursday, sending up a prototype satellite to orbit thousands of miles above Earth.",
      "Named after the first American to orbit Earth, the New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida, soaring from the same pad used to launch NASA's Mariner and Pioneer spacecraft a half-century ago.",
      "Years in the making with heavy funding by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the 320-foot (98-meter) rocket carried an an experimental platform designed to host satellites or release them into their proper orbits.",
      "All seven main engines fired at liftoff as the rocket blazed through the predawn sky to the delight of spectators lining nearby beaches. Bezos took part in the action from Mission Control and Blue Origin employees erupted in cheers once the craft successfully reached orbit 13 minutes later, a feat that drew praise from SpaceX's Elon Musk.",
      "The first-stage booster missed its landing on a barge in the Atlantic, but the company stressed that the more important goal was achieved. Bezos said before the flight it was \u201ca little crazy\u201d to even try to land the booster on the first try.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\" Blue Origin\u2019s CEO Dave Limp said via X about reaching orbit. \"On to spring and trying again on the landing.\u201d",
      "For this test, the satellite was meant to remain inside the second stage while circling Earth. Plans called for the second stage to be placed in a safe condition to stay in a high, out-of-the-way orbit in accordance with NASA's practices for minimizing space junk.",
      "New Glenn was supposed to fly before dawn Monday, but ice buildup in critical plumbing caused a delay. The rocket is built to haul spacecraft and eventually astronauts to orbit and also the moon.",
      "Founded 25 years ago by Bezos, Blue Origin has been launching paying passengers to the edge of space since 2021, including himself. The short hops from Texas use smaller rockets named after the first American in space, Alan Shepard. New Glenn, which honors John Glenn, is five times taller.",
      "Blue Origin poured more than $1 billion into New Glenn's launch site, rebuilding historic Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The pad is 9 miles (14 kilometers) from the company's control centers and rocket factory, outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center.",
      "Blue Origin envisions six to eight New Glenn flights this year, with the next one coming up this spring.",
      "In a weekend interview, Bezos declined to disclose his personal investment in the program. He said he does not see Blue Origin in a competition with Musk\u2019s SpaceX, long the rocket-launching dominator.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s room for lots of winners\u201d Bezos said, adding that this was the \u201cvery, very beginning of this new phase of the space age, where we\u2019re all going to work together as an industry ... to lower the cost of access to space.\"",
      "New Glenn is the latest in a series of big, new rockets to launch in recent years, including United Launch Alliance\u2019s Vulcan, Europe\u2019s upgraded Ariane 6 and NASA's Space Launch System or SLS, the space agency's successor to the Saturn V for sending astronauts to the moon.",
      "The biggest rocket of all, at approximately 400 feet (123 meters), is SpaceX's Starship. Musk said the seventh test flight of the full rocket could occur later Thursday from Texas. He hopes to repeat what he pulled off in October, catching the returning booster at the launch pad with giant mechanical arms.",
      "Starship is what NASA plans to use to land astronauts on the moon later this decade. The first two moon landings under the space agency's Artemis program, which follows the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 1970s, will see crews descending from lunar orbit to the surface in Starships.",
      "Blue Origin's lander, dubbed Blue Moon, will make its debut on the third lunar touchdown by astronauts.",
      "NASA Administrator Bill Nelson pushed for competing moon landers similar to the strategy to hire two companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Nelson will step down when President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Monday.",
      "Trump has tapped tech billionaire Jared Isaacman to run NASA. Isaacman, who has twice rocketed into orbit on his own privately financed SpaceX flights, must be approved by the Senate.",
      "New Glenn's debut was supposed to send twin spacecraft to Mars for NASA. But the space agency pulled them from last October's planned flight when it became clear the rocket wouldn't be ready in time. They will still fly on a New Glenn rocket, but not until spring at the earliest. The two small spacecraft, named Escapade, are meant to study the Martian atmosphere and magnetic environment while orbiting the red planet.",

      "Efforts to ban students' cellphones at school is gaining rare bipartisan consensus in Republican and Democrat-led states",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Arkansas' Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' cellphones need to be banned during the school day.",
      "At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year.",
      "Here is a look at the push by states for such bans.",
      "The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children\u2019s mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom.",
      "Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people\u2019s lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times.",
      "Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them.",
      "Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices.",
      "\u201cIt doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,\u201d she said.",
      "At least eight states \u2014 California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia \u2014 have enacted measures banning or restricting students\u2019 use of cellphones in schools.",
      "The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi.",
      "A 2024 California law requires the state\u2019s nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026.",
      "Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day.",
      "Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 schools signed on. In her state of the state address this week, Sanders proposed an outright ban.",
      "\u201cWe will ban cellphones in our schools, bell to bell, so that our kids are not distracted, in class or out of it,\u201d Sanders said.",
      "Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics.",
      "The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency.",
      "Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time.",
      "But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active shooter situation.",
      "Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation.",
      "Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media on children but that the bans sought by states are taking too broad of an approach. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said.",
      "\u201cWe have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,\u201d she said. \u201cWe've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.\u201d",

      "Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a legal challenge to the statute brought by TikTok, its China-based parent company ByteDance, and users of the app. The Justices seemed likely to uphold the law, which requires ByteDance to divest TikTok on national security grounds or face a ban in one of its biggest markets.",
      "\u201cIf the Supreme Court comes out with a ruling in favor of the law, President Trump has been very clear: Number one, TikTok is a great platform that many Americans use and has been great for his campaign and getting his message out. But number two, he\u2019s going to protect their data,\u201d Waltz said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a deal maker. I don\u2019t want to get ahead of our executive orders, but we\u2019re going to create this space to put that deal in place,\" he added.",

He joined TikTok during his 2024 presidential campaign and his team used it to connect with younger voters, especially male voters, by pushing content that was often macho and aimed at going viral. He pledged to \u201csave TikTok\u201d during the campaign and has credited the platform with helping him win more youth votes.",

    "summary": "President Donald Trump shattered the record for most executive orders signed on his first day in office.",
    "story": [
      "'It's all about common sense,\" Trump said of his executive actions.",
      "Armed with plenty of black Sharpies, President Donald Trump shattered the record for most executive orders signed on his first day in office and became the only commander-in-chief to partly do so in an arena packed with thousands of people.",
      "But the nation's 47th president is already facing legal challenges to some of his most controversial executive actions and others have stoked outrage.",
      "\"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" Trump said during his inauguration speech on Monday. \"It's all about common sense.\"",
      "With those words, Trump immediately began rescinding numerous executive actions taken by now-former President Joe Biden, alleging in a written preamble published with his presidential actions that \"the previous administration has embedded deeply unpopular, inflationary, illegal, and radical practices within every agency and office of the Federal Government.\"",
      "In another unprecedented move, Trump signed his first eight executive actions in front of a wildly enthusiastic crowd filling Washington D.C.'s 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, capping his inauguration parade.",
      "\"President Trump has really made political theater a core part of how he uses unilateral power,\" Jon Rogowski, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago, told ABC News. \"He wants to make sure people know he has taken action that\u2019s consistent with the kinds of campaign promises that he made when he was running for office.\"",
      "What is an executive order?",
      "Executive orders are signed, official documents through which the president manages the operations of the federal government and provides instructions to the executive branch about how to interpret the law, Allan Lichtman, a professor of history at American University in Washington D.C., told ABC News.",
      "\"An executive order is a directive issued by the president that goes into the Federal Register. It has the force of law, but it does not require an act of Congress,\" Lichtman said. \"Although it has the force of law, it can be repealed by a subsequent president issuing executive orders of his or her own.\"",
      "Lichtman said that unlike laws passed by Congress, executive orders are more vulnerable to challenges in the courts, either substantive or procedural.",
      "\"The reason why we are seeing the government by executive order is twofold: Donald Trump was singularly ineffective in getting his agenda through Congress during his first term, even with Republican majorities in the House and the Senate during his first two years. The second reason is they have such a thin majority in the House,\" Lichtman said.",
      "In the past, executive orders were typically challenged after the federal government took action to implement them and someone claimed they had been harmed by that executive action, Rogowski told ABC News.",
      "\"Now, it has changed. Presidents are being sued immediately after they sign an executive order by organizations who represent collections of individuals or by states' attorneys general,\" said Rogowski.",
      "Rogowski said that during Trump's first term \u201cit became more common for groups and for states to directly challenge the president immediately upon the issuance of the directive with which they disagreed.\u201d",
      "\"Over the last decade, there\u2019s been more organization on the ground and among legal groups and states to put pressure on the presidential administration\u2019s use of executive action,\" Rogowski said.",
      "Trump's action prompt legal challenges",
      "Trump on Monday granted 1,500 people convicted of crimes stemming from the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol Building, \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon\" and commuted the sentences of 14 others involved in the riot. Trump called them \"hostages.\"",
      "The Constitution gives a sitting president the power to grant clemency to just about anybody and such actions cannot be reversed. Before leaving office on Monday, Biden issued a slew of preemptive pardons to potential targets of the incoming Trump administration, including several close relatives, Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and lawmakers who served on the House Jan. 6 Committee, including former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney.",
      "\"What they have done to these people is outrageous,\" Trump said while signing the pardons and commutations in the Oval Office.",
      "The pardons and commutations immediately sparked a backlash from both Democrats and Republicans.",
      "\"The president's actions are an outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol, the Congress and the Constitution,\" former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement.",
      "Former Rep. John Katko, R-N.Y., an ABC News contributor, called the pardons of the Jan. 6 rioters \"unsettling\" to members of Congress on both sides of the aisle.",
      "\"They weren't 'hostages,' they were defendants. I was there,\" Katko told ABC News Live Prime anchor Linsey Davis on Monday night. \"A lot of people in the Capitol were beaten. I saw a lot of officers that were severely beaten and injured that night. It was a bad scene.\"",
      "Another controversial executive order Trump signed was one aiming to cut off birthright citizenship. Critics immediately pounced on Trump, arguing people born in the United States are granted citizenship under the U.S. Constitution's 14th Amendment even if their birth parents migrated here illegally.",
      "Asked by reporters if he expected the order to prompt legal challenges, Trump responded, \"We'll see. We have very good grounds. People have wanted to do this for decades.\"",
      "Four federal lawsuits were filed already this week, challenging Trump's birthright citizenship executive order. One was filed in Massachusetts federal court by 18 Democratic state attorneys general, the city of San Francisco and the District of Columbia, accusing Trump of seeking to eliminate a \"well-established and longstanding Constitutional principle.\"",
      "Another federal lawsuit was brought by an undocumented expectant mother and two nonprofit groups, arguing the executive order is an attempt to reinterpret the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to nearly every person born in the United States.",
      "\"This unprecedented attempt to strip citizenship from millions of Americans with the stroke of a pen is flagrantly illegal. The President does not have the power to decide who becomes a citizen at birth,\" the lawsuit argues.",
      "The lawsuit asks the Massachusetts District Court to declare the executive order unconstitutional and issue an injunction preventing it from being enforced.",
      "A similar federal lawsuit was filed by the states of Arizona, Oregon, Washington and Illinois. The American Civil Liberties Union also backed another lawsuit to block Trump's order in New Hampshire.",
      "\"We will not let this attack on newborns and future generations of Americans go unchallenged. The Trump administration's overreach is so egregious that we are confident we will ultimately prevail,\u201d said Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the ACLU.",
      "In other executive actions, Trump issued a proclamation declaring a national emergency at the southern U.S. border, saying, \"America\u2019s sovereignty is under attack.\"",
      "\"Our southern border is overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and illicit narcotics that harm Americans, including America,\" the proclamation reads. \"This invasion has caused widespread chaos and suffering in our country over the last 4 years.\"",
      "Trump also issued an executive order designating certain cartels as foreign terrorists. He signed yet another executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "Many of the proposed executive orders require help from international partners like Mexico and would almost certainly spark legal battles.",
      "\"We have to relate as equals, not subordinates,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday in reaction to Trump's executive orders pertaining to the southern border.",
      "Sheinbaum said her focus is on defending Mexicans and her country's Constitution.",
      "\"You have to keep a cool head with what he signed,\" Sheinbaum said. \"You have to read the decrees. In fact, we continue to study them because some of them went out very late at night and we have a team working on that.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said some of Trump's executive actions are similar to ones he signed during his first term, including the one proclaiming a national emergency at the southern border.",
      "\"There was cooperation between the two governments at that time,\" Sheinbaum said. \"When President Biden comes in, he removes it and now President Trump reinstates it.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said Trump's executive action to prevent asylum seekers from entering the U.S. from Mexico is almost identical to the decree he made in 2018.",
      "As far as changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico, Sheinbaum said, \"For us and the world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico.\"",
      "\"We will always act in the defense of our independence, the defense of our fellow nationals living in the U.S.,\" Sheinbaum said. \"We act within the framework of our constitution and laws. We always act with a cool head.\"",
      "Legal action could delay implementation of orders",
      "Rogowski said legal challenges could delay the executive orders from being put in place.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want to undermine the chances that any of these could have real, tangible consequences for people, but I suspect Trump is going to find it frustrating that many of his actions that he intends to have an immediate effect are instead going to be held up in court for weeks, months or even years, in some cases,\" Rogowski said.",
      "During his first term, Trump signed an executive order that banned foreign nationals from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering the United States for 90 days, suspended entry to the country of all Syrian refugees indefinitely, and prohibited any other refugees from coming into the country for 120 days. Rogowski noted that legal challenges stymied the so-called Muslim ban for 10 months and forced Trump to issue two revised versions of the ban before the U.S. Supreme Court upheld it in a 5-3 ruling issued in June 2018.",
      "'A lot of them are symbolic'",
      "Trump also issued an executive order withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, alleging the organization mishandled the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "As he did in his first term, Trump signed an executive order removing the United States from the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to mitigate climate change that was enacted in 2016. Trump said the agreement doesn't reflect U.S. values and directs \"American taxpayer dollars to countries that do not require, or merit, financial assistance in the interests of the American people.\"",
      "Rogowski said some of the executive actions taken by Trump, like changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico and restoring the name of America's 25th president, William McKinley, to the highest peak in North America, are primarily \"symbolic.\"",
      "Rogowski said renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America \"is not going to advance any of Trump's economic goals or priorities that he outlines, other than make a symbolic change.\"",
      "Lichtman agreed, saying, \"They're symbolic in that they resonate with themes that Trump has been professing ever since he arrived in presidential politics a decade ago.\"",
      "But Lichtman added that many of Trump's executive orders \"are real and they have a real impact on the American people.\"",

      "In a sworn affidavit obtained by Democrats on the Senate Armed Services Committee, the former sister-in-law of defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth said that Hegseth's ex-wife Samantha told her she \"once hid in her closet from Hegseth because she feared for her personal safety\" in the home she shared with Hegseth during their marriage.",
      "The affidavit, which details concerns about allegedly abusive behavior by Hegseth against Samantha, who was Hegseth's second wife, came from Danielle Hegseth, who was previously married to Hegseth's brother.",
      "News of the affidavit was first reported by NBC News, which reported that Samantha refuted many of the claims in the affidavit in a statement to NBC.",
      "\"There was no physical abuse in my marriage. This is the only further statement I will make to you, I have let you know that I am not speaking and will not speak on my marriage to Pete. Please respect this decision,\" NBC reported that Samantha said in an email.",
      "\"Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse, she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview,\" said an attorney for Pete Hegseth, Tim Parlatore, who accused Danielle Hegseth of being \"an anti-Trump far-left Democrat\" who \"had an ax to grind against the entire Hegseth family.\"",
      "Samantha did not respond to a request for comment from ABC News.",
      "Sen. Jack Reed, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, requested the sworn statement from Danielle Hegseth in a letter sent on Jan. 18, after Hegseth had already appeared for a public hearing before the committee.",
      "According to the partially redacted affidavit, obtained by ABC News, Danielle initially provided much of the information in the document to the FBI under the condition of anonymity. But she attests that she was unsure how much of the information was in the FBI report that members of the Armed Services Committee were briefed on, and later made the choice to publicly share her observations in an affidavit.",
      "Hegseth's nomination to serve as secretary of defense cleared the Senate Armed Services Committee by a party-line vote last Monday. His nomination can afford to lose the support of three Republicans on the Senate floor when it comes up for a vote in the coming days.",
      "\"I have chosen to come forward publicly, at significant personal sacrifice, because I am deeply concerned by what Hegseth's confirmation would mean for our military and our country and because I have been assured that making this public statement will ensure that certain Senators who are still on the fence will vote against Hegseth's confirmation,\" Danielle Hegseth says in the affidavit. \"But for that assurance, I would not subject myself or others referred to in this statement to the public scrutiny this statement is likely to cause.\"",
      "In the affidavit, she asserts that Hegseth's second wife, Samantha, had a \"plan to deploy if she felt she needed to get away from Hegseth.\" The plan involved Samantha sending a text message that included a safe word that meant she should call another person to fly to Minnesota to help Samantha, according to the affidavit. Danielle said she was part of the plan's deployment on one occasion, but did not specify why the plan was enacted or what happened after she called the other person.",
      "\"I believe that Samantha feared for her safety and that she did have this plan, not only because I was part of its deployment one time in 2015-2016 but also because it is consistent with what I personally observed of Hegseth's erratic and aggressive behavior over many years,\" she said.",
      "Hegseth, a former Fox News host, faced numerous questions over allegations of misconduct and sexual assault heading into last week's hearing. He has denied wrongdoing and has never been charged.",
      "The FBI performed a background check on Hegseth, but as ABC News reported, only Reed and Sen. Roger Wicker, the Republican Armed Services Committee chairman, were briefed on it.",
      "In the letter requesting a statement from Danielle, Reed wrote that it had come to the committee's attention that she may have \"information that shed light on the fitness of Mr. Hegseth to occupy this important position.\" Reed asked for a statement detailing instances of alleged abuse, mistreatment of a spouse, public drunkenness, treatment of women or \"any other matter you believe speaks to Mr. Hegseth's character and fitness.\"",
      "Aside from the experiences she says were recounted to Danielle by Samantha, Danielle attested to having personally experienced \"emotional abuse\" by Hegseth, recounting an alleged episode during which Hegseth yelled at her and was \"very, aggressive, in my face.\"",
      "She also said Hegseth made \"disparaging comments\" related to people using Spanish to sing the Star Spangled Banner at a football game, and \"rude comments\" about women's looks and his sexual interactions with women.",
      "\"As I told the FBI, I have also heard Hegseth say that women should not have the right to vote and that they should not work,\" she said.",
      "Danielle, in the affidavit, also recounted alleged episodes of Hegseth drinking too much, to the point of passing out.",
      "Hegseth, throughout his confirmation process, has repeatedly asserted that he is a \"changed man.\" During his hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month, he told the panel, \"I am not a perfect person, but redemption is real.\"",
      "Reed, in a statement concerning the affidavit, called the allegations \"disturbing.\"",
      "\"As I have said for months, the reports of Mr. Hegseth's history of alleged sexual assault, alcohol abuse, and public misconduct necessitate an exhaustive background investigation. I have been concerned that the background check process has been inadequate, and this affidavit confirms my fears,\" Reed said in a statement to ABC News. \"The alleged pattern of abuse and misconduct by Mr. Hegseth is disturbing. This behavior would disqualify any servicemember from holding any leadership position in the military, much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense.\"",
      "A representative for Sen. Wicker did not immediately respond to a request for comment from ABC News."

      "President Donald Trump\u2019s goodwill in the cryptocurrency industry has taken a hit after he and his wife launched meme coins \u2014 a move critics say looks like an unseemly cash grab that undermines an effort to legitimize digital assets.",
      "The industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration and spent heavily to help Trump win, is eager for the new president\u2019s help to make crypto a bigger part of mainstream financial systems. Trump has promised a lighter regulatory touch and picked pro-crypto officials for key government positions.",
      "The price of bitcoin and other digital assets has soared since Trump won. A lavish \u201cCrypto Ball\u201d Friday ahead of Trump's inauguration sold tickets for thousands of dollars and featured a performance by the rapper Snoop Dogg.",
      "But as that party was ongoing, Trump announced on social media he was offering his very own cryptocurrency in the form of a meme coin. The move dampened the mood for many in the crypto community.",
      "\"I really was kind of bummed out when I saw it,\u201d said Tom Schmidt, a partner at a crypto venture capital firm Dragonfly. \u201cIt just felt very grifty and cheap.\u201d",
      "Some crypto fans even joked on social media they missed Gary Gensler, the recently departed chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission who was viewed as the Biden administration\u2019s chief crypto antagonist thanks to the SEC's aggressive enforcement actions against crypto companies.",
      "Meme coins are among the wilder and more unregulated corners of the crypto universe. They often start as a joke with no real value but can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Popular meme coins include Dogecoin, whose mascot is a dog, and Fartcoin. Scammers have tried to pump up the price of certain meme coins before dumping them on unsavvy investors.",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin\u2019s release and eager buyers drove up the price of the coin to above $70 each. The price fell dramatically on Sunday after First Lady Melania Trump announced the launch of her own meme coin, which also saw an initial price spike followed by a large fall. As of Tuesday afternoon, Trump\u2019s meme coin was trading at about $45 while the Melania meme coin was at about $4.",
      "Trump named SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda as the agency's acting chief Tuesday and Uyeda quickly announced he was launching a new crypto task force to set the SEC on a \u201csensible regulatory path.\u201d Trump has promised to create a U.S. bitcoin stockpile and enact industry-friendly rules that make it easier for crypto companies to access the broader financial market.",
      "But by associating himself so closely with meme coins, some crypto fans worry that Trump hurts his ability to enact reforms.",
      "\u201cNow, on the cusp of getting some liberalization of crypto regulations in this country, the main thing people are thinking about crypto is, \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a casino for these meme coins,\u2019\u201d said Nic Carter, a Trump supporter and partner at the crypto investment firm Castle Island Ventures. \u201cIt does the opposite of validating us, it makes it look completely unserious.\u201d",
      "The sale of Trump meme coins was organized by CIC Digital, an affiliate of the Trump Organization. In promoting the meme coin, Trump told supporters to \u201cHave Fun!\u201d The website selling the tokens says they are meant as expressions of support and not an investment opportunity. The coin\u2019s website said 200 million Trump meme coins are currently available, with plans to issue 1 billion over the next three years.",
      "The Trump family business recently released an ethics agreement  that prohibits Trump from \u201cday-to-day\u201d decision making at the Trump Organization when he\u2019s president and limits financial information about the business shared with him.",
      "The president and first lady were not the only ones promoting new cryptocurrencies around the inauguration. Lorenzo Sewell, the Michigan pastor who gave a spirited inaugural invocation Monday, announced the launch of a new coin named after him, which he said would be used to benefit his church.",
      "\u201cI need you to do me a favor right now, I need to you to go buy the official Lorenzo Sewell coin,\u201d Sewell said in a video post on social media.",

    "summary": "Here\u2019s what Republican senators told ABC News after President Donald Trump issued pardons for Jan. 6 violent offenders.",
    "story": [
      "Tuberville says he doesn't believe rioters beat police because he didn't see it.",
      "Four years ago, the idea of pardons for Jan. 6 rioters seemed unthinkable to most Republicans.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump floated the idea of pardons, most Republicans stood firm on one thing: violent offenders should not be included in that list.",
      "Here\u2019s what Republican senators told ABC News on Tuesday after Trump issued pardons for or commuted the sentences of more than 1,500 people who rioted at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021:",
      "Sen. Tommy Tuberville claims he\u2019s \u2018never\u2019 seen video of rioters beating police",
      "\u201c100 percent, I'm for the -- pardon everyone. They've been there long enough. Most of them hadn't been charged with anything,\u201d Tuberville told us.",
      "ABC News asked about those pardoned after attacking police -- beating them with fire hydrants and metal batons. Among those pardoned: Devlyn Thompson, who hit a police officer with a metal baton, and Robert Palmer, who attacked police with a fire extinguisher, a wooden plank and a pole.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see that,\u201d the Alabama senator said. When asked if that\u2019s acceptable, Tuberville said \u201cNo, that\u2019s not acceptable, but I didn't see it.\u201d",
      "Tuberville went a step farther: \u201cI don't believe it because I didn't see it. Now, if I see it, I would believe it, but I didn't see in that video.\u201d",
      "Sen. Thom Tillis distances himself from the pardons: \u201cJust can\u2019t agree\u201d",
      "Of the Republican senators ABC News spoke to, only two were willing to fully distance themselves from Trump\u2019s action.",
      "Tillis, of North Carolina, has been outspoken on this issue, even using his time at Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi\u2019s confirmation hearing to publicly press her on the prospect of pardons for the Jan. 6 rioters.",
      "\u201cI find it hard to believe the president or you would look at facts that were used to convict the violent people on Jan. 6 and say it was just an intemperate moment,\u201d he said during that hearing.",
      "When approached on Tuesday, he continued to say he \u201cjust can\u2019t agree.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone -- What I'm trying to do is figure out there are some commutations to me, I just can't agree,\u201d he said. \u201cI'm about to file two bills that will increase the penalties up to and including the death penalty for the murder of a police officer, and increasing the penalties and creating federal crimes for assaulting a police officer. That should give you everything you need to know about my position, like it is, it was surprising to me that it was a blanket pardon. Now I'm going through the details,\u201d Tillis said.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins \u201cdisagrees\u201d with pardons for violent offenders",
      "Collins, of Maine, was among the seven Republicans who, in 2021, voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial over Jan. 6. She said she \u201cdisagrees\u201d with pardons for violent offenders who assaulted officers, broke windows, or performed other violent acts that day.",
      "\u201cI made very clear to you that I think that there's a difference between violent crimes and non-violent crimes. I do not support the pardons if they were given, if they were given to people who committed violent crimes, including assaulting police officers or breaking windows to get into the Capitol or other violent acts, pepper spray, for example,\u201d Collins said.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune insists he hasn't seen the details",
      "Thune was pressed several times in the hallway Monday. He first stated he didn\u2019t have any comment and \u201chadn\u2019t seen all the stuff.\u201d",
      "Later, when asked again, the South Dakota senator said, \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we're looking forward to the next four years, not the last four.\u201d",
      "Some Republicans called the pardons the president\u2019s prerogative",
      "When asked about the violent offenders being pardoned, Texas Sen. John Cornyn said, \u201cThat's not the question. The question is who has the authority, and the president has the authority.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson tried to split the difference, insisting the pardons were \u201cabsolutely justified\u201d while also saying he didn\u2019t want pardons for \u201cviolent actors.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think they were absolutely justified,\u201d he said. \u201cAgain, I don't know all the cases. I certainly don't want to pardon any violent actors, but there's a real miscarriage of justice, so I\u2019m totally supportive.\u201d",
      "When I pointed out Trump had pardoned violent offenders, Johnson said, \"I haven't seen the details, but I think a lot of those pardons are definitely well deserved.\u201d",
      "Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota stated Biden and Trump\u2019s pardons of both Jan. 6 select committee members and those charged with crimes from that day, should \u201cclear the deck\u201d for Americans to put the attack on the Capitol \u201cbehind us.\u201d",
      "When asked about Trump\u2019s promise after the riot that those who broke the law \u201cwill pay,\u201d Cramer said, \u201cI think a lot of those, a lot of those who broke the law have paid it's been four years.\u201d",
      "What about Biden\u2019s pardons?",
      "Several Republican senators brought up President Joe Biden\u2019s 11th-hour pardons.",
      "\u201cWell, are we making a big deal about the pardons that Biden put in place? That\u2019d be worse,\u201d Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma said when asked how he felt about Trump pardoning violent offenders. Mullin, who has previously said that those who committed violent crimes that day \u201cneed to pay for that,\u201d continued to point back to Biden when asked if he changed his tune.",
      "At least one Democrat seemed to understand that argument from Republicans. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine said Trump\u2019s pardons of Jan. 6 criminals were \u201charder to critique\u201d because of Biden\u2019s pardons for family members.",
      "\u201cI'm very disappointed in them,\u201d Kaine said Tuesday about Biden\u2019s actions.",
      "\u201cBecause I think, look, I think we need to make a critique of some of the unjust pardons, like the January 6 pardon. And I think it's harder to make a critique, to stand on the high ground and make a critique of the Trump pardons on January 6, when President Biden is pardoning family members,\u201d the Virginia Democrat said.",

    "summary": "Public health experts say there could be massive implications after President Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization.",
    "story": [
      "In his order, Trump accused the WHO of \"mishandling\" the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday evening withdrawing the United States from the World Health Organization, a move some public health experts say will put the nation at a major disadvantage.",
      "In the order, Trump accused the WHO of \"mishandling\" the COVID-19 pandemic, not adopting \"urgently needed reforms\" and being politically influenced by other member states.",
      "The president also said the withdrawal was about \"being ripped off.\"",
      "\"Everybody rips off the United States and that's it -- it's not going to happen anymore,\" Trump said Monday night when asked by a reporter about his experience leading the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and the importance of the WHO to mount a global response to pandemics.",
      "The text of the executive order describes an \"unfair\" demand of \"onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "\"China, with a population of 1.4 billion, has 300 percent of the population of the United States, yet contributes nearly 90 percent less to the WHO,\" the executive order reads.",
      "Trump's executive order is an attempt to finish a process he began during the last months of his first term. The president temporarily slashed funding and signed an executive order in July 2020 removing the U.S. from the WHO but, because withdrawal requires a one-year notice, former President Joe Biden reversed the decision upon taking office in January 2021.",
      "Public health experts who spoke to ABC News said they worry the withdrawal from the WHO will put the U.S. at a disadvantage when it comes to responding to health crises at home and abroad.",
      "\"The U.S. withdrawal from the WHO is really disappointing news. It's a strategic mistake in so many ways for us as a country,\" Dr. Daniele Fallin, dean of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta, told ABC News.",
      "\"Not being part of the WHO means not only do we threaten the health of Americans and our fellow humans across the globe, but we also lose our stature as a leader in global health, and I'm very concerned about that,\" she added.",
      "Here's what experts said would be the implications of the U.S. leaving the WHO:",
      "U.S. could miss early warning signs of disease",
      "Removing the U.S. from the WHO could hamper efforts to address current public health issues, such as bird flu, the experts said.",
      "Human cases have been diagnosed across the country since April 2024, with 67 confirmed as of Monday, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The CDC and other public health officials say there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission and the risk to the general public is low. However, federal health officials have prepared millions of vials of an available bird flu vaccine as a precautionary measure, in case it becomes necessary.",
      "Last year, the WHO announced it had launched an initiative to help accelerate the development of a human bird flu vaccine using messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.",
      "No longer being part of the WHO could mean losing the ability to collaborate on disease preparedness and response, as well as the ability to exchange information about emerging threats to public health, the experts said.",
      "The U.S. also majorly contributes to the WHO's work, including collaborations with the CDC and the National Institutes of Health on issues including cancer prevention and global health security.",
      "\"I think about the WHO as a network of countries around the world that inform and protect each other when health issues are emerging, whether they're health issues entering into the United States, or whether the health issue is going outside the United States,\" Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health in New Jersey, told ABC News. \"And so, it is disadvantageous for people, and is disadvantageous for the United States, [who need] access to relevant, timely, important information.\"",
      "U.S. could play lesser role in responding to global health crises",
      "WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus responded to the withdrawal announcement in a statement early Tuesday morning, expressing \"regret\" to hear the news.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats,\" his statement read, in part. \"Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication. American institutions have contributed to and benefited from membership in WHO.\"",
      "Public health experts said not being part of the WHO when those initiatives were being conducted -- and, in some cases, are still being conducted -- would have been detrimental to making progress at home and abroad.",
      "Thomas Bollyky, director of the global health program at the think tank Council on Foreign Relations, described the executive order removing the U.S. from the WHO as \"an enormous mistake.\"",
      "He said he's worried because it comes at the same time as another executive order Trump signed putting a 90-day pause on all foreign aid spending.",
      "\"Many U.S. global health programs fund the ongoing treatment of individuals for malaria or for HIV/AIDS,\" he told ABC News. \"A 90-day pause could be significantly disruptive to the operation of those programs, and it is not entirely certain how the strategy review that will occur during that time will affect global health programs moving forward.\"",
      "\"The WHO is not a perfect institution, but it plays an irreplaceable role in global outbreak response and, by withdrawing this action, reduces the ability of the United States to positively influence that response to outbreak. It makes Americans less safe,\" Bollyky added.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 16:03:24 -0500",
    "summary": "After taking the oath of office, Marco Rubio promised that every action taken by the State Department will be determined by the answers to three questions.",
    "story": [
      "Rubio is the first confirmed Cabinet member of Trump\u2019s second administration.",
      "After taking the oath of office to be sworn in as the nation's 72nd secretary of state, Marco Rubio promised that every action taken by the State Department will be determined by the answers to three questions: \"Does it make us stronger? Does it make us safer? And does it make us more prosperous?\"",
      "The Senate unanimously confirmed Rubio's appointment to secretary of state Monday evening, making Rubio the first confirmed Cabinet member of the second Trump administration.",
      "Rubio also gave remarks in Spanish, giving thanks to God and his family members both present and not present -- including his parents, who he said came to the United States in 1956 and that the purpose of their lives was that their children could realize dreams that were not possible for them.",
      "Rubio, a Cuban American son of refugees, is the first Hispanic American ever to hold this position.",
      "\"It's an incredible honor to be the secretary of state of the most powerful, best country in the world,\" he continued in Spanish, thanking President Donald Trump for the opportunity.",
      "Switching back to English, Rubio joked, \"I just said I saved a bunch of money by switching to Geico -- that's what I said.\"",
      "The former senator also echoed themes from Trump's inaugural address and reiterated the president's platform.",
      "\"[Trump's] primary promise when it comes to foreign policy is that the priority of the United States Department of State will be the United States. It will be furthering the national interest of this country,\" Rubio said.",
      "\"We will work hard every second of the day to help him achieve the agenda the American people have given him to achieve,\" he added.",
      "In addition to thanking his former colleagues, including Vice President J.D. Vance and Idaho Sen. James Risch, Rubio expressed gratitude to his family and emphasized that \"the most important job I'll ever have is that of a father and husband.\"",
      "Rubio told State Department employees later Tuesday that he wanted the department to \"be where it belongs -- I want the Department of State to be at the center of how America engages the world.\"",
      "\"There will be changes. But the changes are not meant to be destructive,\" Rubio added. \"They're not meant to be punitive, they're not -- the changes will be because we need to be a 21st century agency that can move, by a clich\u00e9 that's used by many, at the speed of relevancy. But we need to move faster than we ever have because the world is changing faster.\"",
      "Ahead of the swearing-in ceremony Tuesday morning, Rubio spoke with CBS and was asked about Trump's statement that he is \"not confident\" the ceasefire in Gaza will hold.",
      "\"Well, I'm hoping and praying it will hold -- but remember, on Oct. 6 there was a ceasefire in place between Israel and Hamas. Oct. 7 was a violation of that,\" Rubio said. \"So when you're dealing with a terrorist organization that has committed atrocities, motivated by all kinds of evil, I don't think you can go into it very confident that things will hold in the long term.",
      "\"We want it to work out. We think there is the broader hope of a peace in the region,\" he added. \"So we're hopeful, but I think we need to be realistic about what we're dealing with here.\"",
      "Rubio also spoke with ABC's \"Good Morning America\" and discussed Trump's pardons for Jan. 6 rioters, TikTok and the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "Rubio sidestepped directly weighing on the pardons, saying his \"focus needs to be 100% on how I interact with our counterparts, our adversaries, our potential enemies around the world to keep this country safe, to make it prosperous.\"",
      "When asked about Trump's campaign pledge to end the conflict between Russia and Ukraine on Day One, Rubio contended the matter is more complex and that negotiations will not be played out in public.",
      "\"Look, this is a complex, tragic conflict, one that was started by Vladimir Putin that's inflicted a tremendous amount of damage on Ukraine and also on Russia, I would argue, but also on the stability of Europe,\" Rubio said. \"So the only way to solve these things, we got to get back to pragmatism, but we also get back to seriousness here, and that is the hard work of diplomacy. The U.S. has a role to play here. We've been supportive of Ukraine, but this conflict has to end.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 19:05:09 -0500",
    "summary": "Leading candidates for the Democratic National Committee chair election said front-runner Ken Martin's claim that he has the support of 200 members is inflated.",
    "story": [
      "Front-runner Ken Martin claims 200 endorsements, which his opponents dispute.",
      "Leading candidates for the Democratic National Committee chairperson election said Tuesday's claim by front-runner Ken Martin that he has the support of 200 members is inflated and fails to paint an accurate picture of the dynamics of the race.",
      "Chair candidates need a simple majority of DNC members, or 225 votes, to win. If it holds, Martin's latest endorsement count would bring him close to victory on the first ballot.",
      "The role of the chair, who guides fundraising, recruiting and organizing efforts for Democrats nationally, holds particular importance in years when the party is outside of the White House and lacks a de facto leader.",
      "Whoever wins the election will have the responsibility of balancing messaging against the Trump presidency while looking to define and rebuild a party now marked by decisive losses in the executive branch and across both chambers of Congress.",
      "Typically, presidents appoint their own chairs to lead the parties they represent.",
      "Martin, the Minnesota Democratic Party chairman, announced his 200-member number in a statement Tuesday morning.",
      "\"I'm honored to have gained the support of leaders from across the country,\" Martin said. \"Our campaign is gaining momentum and we're going to continue to work hard for people's votes.\"",
      "The teams of Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and Wisconsin Democratic Party Chairman Ben Wikler claimed the dynamics of the race are far from locked.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Wikler's spokesperson claimed Martin is inflating his whip count in an attempt to create \"false momentum\" and \"lacks a clear path to victory.\"",
      "\"Ken Martin is releasing inflated whip counts because his momentum in this race has stalled and he is seeking to create a false sense of momentum,\" the spokesperson said. \"Our internal count has Ben within 30 votes of Ken, with a surge in support since last week's union endorsements. Ken has fewer votes than the combined support for Ben and Martin O'Malley and lacks a clear path to the majority.\"",
      "O'Malley's team swiped at Martin, claiming that the 200 figure is inflated and unsubstantiated. Pushing further than Wikler's team, O'Malley spokesman Chris Taylor told ABC News that \"not a single soul\" believes Martin, who he asserted is acting \"beneath the seriousness of this moment.\"",
      "\"This race isn't about inflated and unsubstantiated numbers or tricks and gimmicks,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"It's about making the changes we need to win and rebuilding the Democratic Party for the future of our Republic. There is not a single soul running for any DNC office who believes Ken Martin's count. It's disrespectful to the 448 voting members of the DNC -- many of whom are still making up their minds -- and beneath the seriousness of this moment.\"",
      "In their statements, O'Malley's and Wikler's teams both pointed to their internal numbers, which they said show a much closer race. None of the leading candidates have provided a full list of names of their supporters. O'Malley's team said it has commitments from 100 members. Wikler's team declined to offer its internal count.",
      "Even still, public endorsements for Martin seem to outnumber all others.",
      "Over the past few weeks, Martin's campaign has been rolling out daily endorsements on social media. His bid boasts the support of at least 50 current state party chairs and vice chairs, including party leaders from swing-states Arizona, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, and several members of Congress, including Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith and former Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, as well as leaders of the Young Democrats of America.",
      "Wikler has the support from one of the highest-ranking Democrats, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and rubber stamps from both centrist and progressive organizations within the party. Last week, Wikler won the support of four powerful public sector unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.",
      "O'Malley has also been rolling out endorsements from individual members, including current and former members of the Congressional Black Caucus, alongside former mayors.",
      "The DNC has been hosting forums that function as debates between candidates for all officer positions. There are two left, one this week and one next week, a few days before the officer elections on Feb. 1.",

      "Those connected to the US mission in Afghanistan are at risk, an advocate says.",
      "President Donald Trump's executive order freezing refugee programs could impact thousands of Afghans approved to resettle as refugees in the United States, according to one major advocacy organization.",
      "That includes family members of U.S. service members and Afghans who served alongside the U.S. military in partner forces, as well as others \"who in one way or another are connected to the U.S. mission and are at risk through their association with us,\" Shawn VanDiver, the president of #AfghanEvac, a coalition working to bring Afghans safely out of Afghanistan, told ABC News.",
      "\"We have a commitment there,\" he said. \"Our national security promises can't be conditional based on who is in the Oval Office.\"",
      "VanDiver confirmed a Reuters report that nearly 1,660 Afghans cleared to resettle in the U.S. could have their flights canceled. As of Tuesday, the flights have not been canceled as the administration works through the order, which takes effect on Jan. 27.",
      "The program will be suspended for at least 90 days, according to the order, after which the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security will submit a report to the president on whether restarting the program \"would be in the interests of the United States.\"",
      "If it is suspended indefinitely, it could wind up affecting as many as 30,000 to 40,000 Afghans currently in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Qatar, some of whom could face reprisals from the Taliban for cooperating with American forces, VanDiver said.",
      "America's \"bilateral relationships are at risk here,\" he said. \"Our partners need to be able to trust our word.\"",
      "ABC News spoke to half a dozen senators Tuesday about the status of Afghan refugees. Several Republicans -- including Trump allies like Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Kevin Cramer of North Dakota -- are in favor of clarifying the order to make sure that thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. in Afghanistan aren't left in limbo.",
      "\"I'd like to get them back here if there associated with helping our cause,\" Graham told ABC News.",
      "\"I hope they can work through that. The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan was traumatic enough,\" Cramer said. \"One of the reasons was that it left behind so many of our allies.\"",
      "The White House, State Department and the National Security Council did not immediately respond to ABC News' questions about the order and its impact on vetted Afghan refugees.",
      "\"I can't imagine that their intention was to include interpreters and allies in Afghanistan who helped us, and we left them behind,\" Cramer said, adding that veterans groups have expressed concern to him about the status of Afghans under the new executive order."

      "Judge Aileen Cannon, in an order issued one day after Trump's inauguration, offered a scathing criticism of the Department of Justice's \"startling\" conduct and willingness to \"gamble\" with the rights of Trump's former co-defendants by attempting to allow four members of Congress to review Smith's final report as directed by DOJ policy.",
      "\"Prosecutors play a special role in our criminal justice system and are entrusted and expected to do justice,\" Cannon wrote. \"The Department of Justice's position on Defendants' Emergency Motion ... has not been faithful to that obligation.\"",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in June 2023 to 37 criminal counts related to his handling of classified materials, after prosecutors said he repeatedly refused to return hundreds of documents containing classified information. The former president, along with his longtime aide Walt Nauta and staffer Carlos De Oliveira, also pleaded not guilty in a superseding indictment to allegedly attempting to delete surveillance footage at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "Judge Cannon dismissed the case in July based on the constitutionality of Smith's appointment, and Smith dropped Trump from his appeal of the case after the election due to a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president -- but the Justice Department appealed the dismissal of the case against Nauta and De Oliveira.",
      "Cannon, in her ruling issued Tuesday, criticized prosecutors for being willing to release sensitive court materials -- including material pursuant to grand jury subpoenas -- while the case against Trump's former co-defendants is ongoing.",
      "\"In short, the Department offers no valid justification for the purportedly urgent desire to release to members of Congress case information in an ongoing criminal proceeding,\" Cannon wrote.",
      "Cannon expressed concern that the report, if shown to members of Congress, could be leaked publicly and prevent Trump's former co-defendants from having a fair trial.",
      "\"This Court lacks any means to enforce any proffered conditions of confidentiality, to the extent they even exist in memorialized form. And most fundamentally, the Department has offered no valid reason to engage in this gamble with the Defendants' rights,\" the order said.",
      "Cannon's order remains in effect at least 30 days after the case proceedings conclude, at which point the Justice Department can advise the court about their position on the order.",
      "The DOJ's new leadership under the Trump is not expected to press for the report's release, making it unlikely that the report will ever see the light of day.",

      "Trump\u2019s executive actions are expected to rescind Biden administration policies.",
      "President Donald Trump is expected to issue a slew of executive actions on Monday that would impact transgender Americans, including an executive order declaring that the U.S. government will only recognize a person\u2019s gender assigned at birth, Trump officials told reporters during a press call.",
      "The executive orders, which Trump is expected to sign on Monday, his first day in office, include prohibiting federal funds from being used in programs that acknowledge people who identify as transgender, according to Trump officials.",
      "\u201cIt is the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female. These are sexes that are not changeable, and they are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality,\u201d an incoming White House official said during the call, which took place ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday.",
      "Trump\u2019s executive actions are expected to rescind 2023 Biden administration policies related to the treatment of transgender individuals in the federal workplace.",
      "Policies include Biden administration guidance on gender and inclusion for public servants, which was issued on March 31, 2023, marking Trans Visibility Day, in which the Office of Personnel Management updated guidance on gender inclusion in the federal workplace, including ensuring that \u201call federal employees have their respective gender identities accurately reflected and identified in the workplace.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration guidance also directed federal agencies to \u201ctake steps to implement or increase the availability of training programs on gender identity and inclusion in the federal workplace for employees, managers, and leadership.\u201d",
      "According to Trump officials, Trump\u2019s executive actions also would rescind many policies set by the Biden administration, including withholding federal money from schools and colleges unless they followed certain rules to protect trans students from harassment.",
      "In addition, entities like prisons and shelters that receive federal funds would also be required to designate \u201csingle sex\u201d spaces, White House officials said, assigning people to certain areas based on their gender assigned at birth.",
      "Trump also plans to rescind a 2022 Biden administration rule in which the U.S. Department of State made it possible for people applying for U.S. passports to be able to select \"X\" to mark their gender, officials said.",
      "The move, which was designed to accommodate nonbinary, intersex and gender nonconforming individuals, was announced by then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken on March 31, 2022, marking Transgender Day of Visibility.",
      "\"The Department of State has reached another milestone in our work to better serve all U.S. citizens, regardless of their gender identity,\" Blinken said in a statement at the time.",
      "The Human Rights Campaign, a leading LGBTQ+ advocacy group, told ABC News in a statement that while the group has not seen the text of the executive orders, HRC is committed to working to help combat these actions in the courts and in Congress to \u201censure that LGBTQ+ people are protected.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery person deserves to be treated with dignity and respect in all areas of their lives,\u201d HRC President Kelley Robinson told ABC News in a statement on Monday. \u201cNo one should be subjected to ongoing discrimination, harassment and humiliation where they work, go to school, or access health care. But today\u2019s expected executive actions targeting the LGBTQ+ community serve no other purpose than to hurt our families and our communities.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny attack on our rights threatens the rights of any person who doesn\u2019t fit into the narrow view of how they should look and act,\u201d Robinson added. \u201cThe incoming administration is trying to divide our communities in the hope that we forget what makes us strong. But we refuse to back down or be intimidated.\u201d",

      "Jeanne Kay Whitefeather took the stand Tuesday as the second week began in the trial of her and her husband, Donald Ray Lantz. They are accused of mistreating four of the five children, all of whom are Black. Whitefeather and Lantz, who are white, each face more than a dozen felony counts that include forced labor, civil rights violations, human trafficking and gross child neglect.",
      "Whitefeather and Lantz were arrested in October 2023 when neighbors called police to report seeing Lantz lock the oldest girl and her teenage brother in the shed and leave the property in Sissonville.",

      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t locked in,\u201d Whitefeather testified. \u201cThey had a key. They could come and go as they pleased.\u201d",
      "But the oldest daughter, now 18, testified last week that she didn\u2019t know about access to a key, which a detective had testified earlier was found out of sight on top of a cabinet in the shed.",
      "The daughter also said the children were given a steady diet of peanut butter sandwiches at scheduled times and were not allowed to eat at other times, even if they were hungry. But Whitefeather said the children were allowed to use the refrigerator and said she cooked food every night.",
      "After the couple's arrest, all five children were placed under the care of Child Protective Services. The couple adopted the five siblings while living in Minnesota. They moved to a farm in Washington state in 2018 before moving again to West Virginia in 2023, when the children ranged in age from 5 to 16. The oldest boy is receiving full-time care in a psychiatric facility."

      "Jackie Johnson served as district attorney when Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, was chased by three white men in pickup trucks and fatally shot on a residential street. Johnson's misconduct trial will be held in the same courthouse where Arbery's assailants were convicted of murder in 2021.",
      "Officials summoned a large pool of potential jurors given the notoriety of Arbery's killing and Johnson's public profile during her decade as the top prosecutor in coastal Glynn County.",

      "Potential jurors will be asked what they've read or heard about Arbery's killing and the case against Johnson, and whether they're able to serve as impartial jurors. Walden said she suspects it could take a week to select a jury of 12 members plus alternates.",
      "Greg McMichael, a retired investigator for Johnson's office, started the pursuit with his son Travis McMichael on Sept. 23, 2020, after Arbery ran past his home just outside the port city of Brunswick. Travis McMichael killed Arbery with a shotgun at point-blank range as a neighbor who joined the chase, William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, recorded the shooting on his cellphone. The men later said they wrongly suspected Arbery was a thief.",

      "The Georgia Bureau of Investigation then took over the case from local police. All three men were arrested, convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. They were also found guilty of federal hate crimes in a separate 2022 trial.",
      "Johnson was indicted in September 2021 on a charge of violating her oath of office, a felony punishable by one to five years in prison, and a misdemeanor count of hindering police as they investigated Arbery's death.

      "Johnson has denied wrongdoing, insisting she immediately handed the case to an outside prosecutor because of her connection to Greg McMichael. She was voted out of office in November 2020, a defeat she largely blamed on controversy over Arbery's death.",

      "\u201cDon\u2019t do things to start another fire so we can focus on the mitigation of the current fires,\u201d Acuna said.",
      "The low humidity, bone-dry vegetation and strong Santa Ana winds come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on Jan. 7. The Palisades fire was 61% contained early Tuesday and the Eaton fire 87% contained, according to fire officials.",
      "More evacuation orders were lifted Monday for Pacific Palisades and authorities said only residents would be allowed to get back in after showing proof of residency at a checkpoint. Over the weekend, two men impersonating firefighters attempted to enter an evacuation zone for the Palisades Fire, according to the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department.",
      "Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday the city was prepared for any possible new fires and warned the strong winds could disperse ash from existing fire zones across Southern California. She urged Angelenos to visit lacity.gov to learn about ways to protect themselves from toxic air during Santa Ana winds.",
      "Cal Fire and local fire departments have positioned fire engines, water-dropping aircraft and hand crews across the region to enable a quick response should a new fire break out, Acuna said.",
      "Acuna said Cal Fire had extra fire crews in Kern and Riverside counties.",
      "Los Angeles fire officials said the department has all available engines ready and that 30 of them had been positioned in fire risk areas. The agency also ordered the outgoing shift of about 1,000 firefighters to remain on duty to staff the extra engines.",
      "\u201cThe pre-deployment is very, very thoughtful and strategic,\u201d Crowley said."

      "President Donald Trump has signed an executive order temporarily suspending all U.S. foreign assistance programs for 90 days pending reviews to determine whether they are aligned with his policy goals",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending all U.S. foreign assistance programs for 90 days pending reviews to determine whether they are aligned with his policy goals.",
      "It was not immediately clear how much assistance would initially be affected by the Monday order as funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress and is obligated to be spent, if not already spent.",
      "The order, among many Trump signed on his first day back in office, said the \u201cforeign aid industry and bureaucracy are not aligned with American interests and in many cases antithetical to American values\u201d and \u201cserve to destabilize world peace by promoting ideas in foreign countries that are directly inverse to harmonious and stable relations internal to and among countries.\u201d",
      "Consequently, Trump declared that \u201cno further United States foreign assistance shall be disbursed in a manner that is not fully aligned with the foreign policy of the President of the United States.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during his confirmation hearing last week that \u201cevery dollar we spend, every program we fund, and every policy we pursue must be justified with the answer to three simple questions:",
      "\u201cDoes it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?\u201d he said.",
      "The order signed by Trump leaves it up to Rubio or his designee to make such determinations, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development are the main agencies that oversee foreign assistance.",
      "Trump has long railed against foreign aid despite the fact that such assistance typically amounts to roughly 1% of the federal budget, except under unusual circumstances such as the billions in weaponry provided to Ukraine. Trump has been critical of the amount shipped to Ukraine to help bolster its defenses against Russia's invasion.",
      "The last official accounting of foreign aid in the Biden administration dates from mid-December and budget year 2023. It shows that $68 billion had been obligated for programs abroad that range from disaster relief to health and pro-democracy initiatives in 204 countries and regions.",
      "Some of the biggest recipients of U.S. assistance, Israel ($3.3 billion per year), Egypt ($1.5 billion per year) and Jordan ($1.7 billion per year) are unlikely to see dramatic reductions, as those amounts are included in long-term packages that date back decades and are in some cases governed by treaty obligations.",
      "Funding for U.N. agencies, including peacekeeping, human rights and refugee agencies, have been traditional targets for Republican administrations to slash or otherwise cut. The first Trump administration moved to reduce foreign aid spending, suspending payments to various UN agencies, including the U.N. Population Fund, and funding to the Palestinian Authority.",
      "However, the U.S. previously under Trump had already pulled out of the U.N. Human Rights Council, with its financial obligations, and has been barred from funding the the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, by a bill signed by former President Joe Biden last March."

      "Trump's order, coming just hours after he returned to the White House, compels the Justice Department to not only seek the death penalty in appropriate federal cases but also to help preserve capital punishment in states that have struggled to maintain adequate supplies of lethal injection drugs.",
      "Trump had been expected to restart federal executions, which have been on hold since a moratorium was imposed by former Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2021. Only three defendants remain on federal death row after Democratic President Joe Biden recently converted 37 of their sentences to life in prison.",
      "Trump directed the attorney general to pursue federal jurisdiction and seek the death penalty \"regardless of other factors\u201d when the case involves the killing of a law enforcement officer or capital crimes \u201ccommitted by an alien illegally present in this country.\" He's also instructing the attorney general to seek to overrule Supreme Court precedents that \u201climit the authority of limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.\u201d",

      "Trump's administration carried out 13 federal executions during his first term, more than under any president in modern history, and the president has spoken frequently of expanding executions. In a speech announcing his 2024 campaign, Trump called for those \u201ccaught selling drugs to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts.\u201d He later promised to execute drug and human smugglers and even praised China\u2019s harsher treatment of drug peddlers.",
      "Trump's order comes days after Garland withdrew the Justice Department's protocol for federal executions that allowed for single-drug lethal injections with pentobarbital, after a government review raised concerns about the potential for \u201cunnecessary pain and suffering.\u201d The protocol could be imposed by Trump's new acting Attorney General James McHenry III, or his his pick to lead the Justice Department, Pam Bondi, once she's confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The pentobarbital protocol was adopted by Bill Barr, attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term, to replace a three-drug mix used in the 2000s, the last time federal executions were carried out before Trump was in office.",
      "Biden's decision last month left just three inmates on federal death row. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history."

The prayer by a Michigan pastor heavily cited King's seminal \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech alongside the Declaration of Independence, patriotic songs and gospel hymns.",
      "In his spirited roughly three-minute invocation on Monday, Rev. Lorenzo Sewell thanked God for the incoming Trump administration and prayed \u201cthat America would begin to dream again.\u201d",
      "The comments were at times a near complete rendition of King\u2019s 1963 address. He asked God to \u201clet freedom ring\u201d nationwide and ensure that Americans are \u201cfree at last. Free at last. Thank God Almighty, we are free at last.\u201d",

      "\u201cHeavenly father, we are so grateful that you gave our 45th and now our 47th president a millimeter miracle,\u201d Sewell said Monday, referencing the July attempt on Trump\u2019s life.",
      "Here is more about Sewell and the reaction to his benediction:",
      "Sewell, 43, has been the pastor at the non-denominational 180 Church on the west side of Detroit for seven years, and has said he came to Christianity in 1999 after a spiritual revelation from God.",
      "Sewell adheres to a charismatic, conservative Christian doctrine and does not shy away from politics in his ministry.",
      "\u201cThe gospel message is a political message. The Bible is a political book, from Genesis to Revelations. We see that the Bible is a political book,\u201d Sewell told Fox News in January. \u201cIt is impossible to be politically neutral.\"",
      "At the Black Conservative Federation\u2019s Legacy of Freedom Ball on Sunday night, Sewell invoked Bible verses and gospel hymns as he prayed for Trump's protection.",

      "Monday's ceremony was the third time a presidential inauguration has coincided with Martin Luther King Day in the nearly 40 years since its enactment as a federal holiday. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were also inaugurated for their second terms on the holiday.",

      "\"To the Black and Hispanic communities, I want to thank you for the tremendous outpouring of love and trust that you have shown me with your vote. We set records and I will not forget it. I\u2019ve heard your voices in the campaign, and I look forward to working with you in the years to come,\" Trump said.",
      "\"Today is Martin Luther King Day, and his honor \u2014 this will be a great honor \u2014 but in his honor, we will strive together to make his dream a reality. We will make his dream come true,\" Trump declared.",
      "He said he intends to \u201cend the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\u201d and promised to \u201cforge a society that is colorblind and merit based.\u201d",
      "King's family observed the holiday with a day of service and prayer, but references to the new administration were evident throughout. During proceedings at the King Center in Atlanta, Rev. William Barber III rejected the idea that Trump has the right to carry out the most sweeping parts of his agenda.",
      "\u201cYou never win a mandate to violate justice. You never win a mandate to hurt people with your power,\u201d Barber said. \u201cWe come today to remember Dr. King but more so to commit ourselves to the spirit,\u201d he continued, praying \u201cthat every day we\u2019ve got life in our bodies, to tell America who she is supposed to be.\u201d",
      "Civil rights leaders, including King\u2019s family, said before the inauguration that they were unsettled by the juxtaposition of Trump\u2019s return to the White House and the King holiday.",
      "But many, including King\u2019s youngest daughter Dr. Bernice King, urged those who want to carry out King\u2019s vision to watch the inaugural address. Major civil rights organizations have adopted a wait-and-see approach to Trump\u2019s second term, even as many privately prepared for him to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion policies, social programs and civil rights laws.",
      "\"For some, today\u2019s inauguration represents the best of time: Make America great again. And for others, it highlights the worst of times: Set America back again. For some, today\u2019s King holiday represents a day to champion freedom, justice and democracy. For others, it\u2019s a day to decry DEI, disavow a legacy of peace, love and justice and distort the meaning of King\u2019s words,\" she said.",
      "\"But regardless of how this day shows up for you, we must remember the mission and be in pursuit of it,\" King continued.",
      "The holiday proceedings took place in Ebenezer Baptist Church, where the late King once presided. The senior of that church was not present for the sermons and day of service. Rev. Raphael Warnock, who also serves as a senator for Georgia in Congress, was in Washington observing the inaugural proceedings.",

      "He also is credited with helping scuttle a bipartisan government funding proposal last month, in part by posting false claims on X, where he has over 200 million followers. The platform has largely abandoned guardrails against misinformation and has experienced a surge in conspiracy theories and bogus claims since Musk bought what was then Twitter nearly three years ago. That has raised concerns about how it could be used to manipulate public perception given its owner's ties to the Trump administration.",

      "President Donald Trump says he plans to rename North America\u2019s tallest peak, Denali in Alaska, as Mount McKinley",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- President Donald Trump on Monday vowed to rename North America's tallest peak, Denali in Alaska, as Mount McKinley \u2014 reviving an idea he'd floated years ago that at that time saw strong pushback from state political leaders.",
      "Trump, who took office for a second time Monday, said he planned to \u201crestore the name of a great president, William McKinley, to Mount McKinley, where it should be and where it belongs. President McKinley made our country very rich through tariffs and through talent.\u201d Trump also announced plans to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.",
      "Messages left for Alaska's three-member Republican congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy weren't immediately returned. Alaska's U.S. senators in 2017 vehemently opposed a prior suggestion by Trump that the name Denali be changed back to Mount McKinley.",
      "In 2015, then-President Barack Obama changed the name to Denali to reflect the traditions of Alaska Natives and acknowledge the preference of many Alaska residents. The federal government in recent years has sought to change place names considered disrespectful to Native people.",
      "Denali is an Athabascan word meaning \u201cthe high one\u201d or \u201cthe great one.\u201d The iconic 20,310-foot (6,190-meter) mountain, snow-capped and dotted with glaciers, is in Denali National Park and Preserve.",
      "A prospector in 1896 dubbed the peak \u201cMount McKinley\u201d after President William McKinley, who had never been to Alaska. The name was formally recognized by the U.S. government until Obama changed it \u2014 in spite of opposition from lawmakers in McKinley\u2019s home state of Ohio.",
      "Trump raised the notion of a name change again during a rally late last year, following his election.",
      "\u201cMcKinley was a very good, maybe a great president,\u201d Trump said in December. \u201cThey took his name off Mount McKinley, right? That\u2019s what they do to people.\u201d",
      "Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was among those expressing opposition to a name change from Denali.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t improve upon the name that Alaska\u2019s Koyukon Athabascans bestowed on North America\u2019s tallest peak, Denali \u2013 the Great One,\" she said at that time, adding that the issue \"should not be relitigated.\u201d",
      "The Tanana Chiefs Conference, a consortium of Athabascan tribes in Interior Alaska, spent years advocating for the peak to be recognized as Denali.",
      "McKinley, a Republican native of Ohio, was the 25th president. He was assassinated early in his second term in 1901.",
      "Alaska and Ohio had been at odds over the name since at least the 1970s. Alaska had a standing request to change the name since 1975, when the legislature passed a resolution and then-Gov. Jay Hammond appealed to the federal government."

      "Richards died Monday at home \u201csurrounded by family and her ever-loyal dog, Ollie,\u201d her family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cOur hearts are broken today but no words can do justice to the joy she brought to our lives,\u201d the family said.",
      "Richards, the daughter of the late Texas Gov. Ann Richards, was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in 2023, five years after she left Planned Parenthood.",
      "Though Planned Parenthood also provides birth control, cancer screenings and testing for sexually transmitted diseases at clinics nationwide, its status as the nation\u2019s leading abortion provider has long made it a lightning rod for debate. Richards played a prominent role in pushing back against criticism during her tenure as president and beyond.",
      "In 2015, she spent hours answering hostile questions from Republican U.S. House members who later created an investigative panel to probe Planned Parenthood\u2019s abortion and fetal-tissue policies. In 2021, she warned that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s inaction on Texas\u2019 restrictive abortion law could signal the end of judicial checks and balances on the issue. And after the court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, she continued to speak out.",

      "In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some researchers in Michigan are looking for a late bloomer",
      "In the quest to make apple trees more resilient in a warming climate, some Michigan researchers are looking for a late bloomer.",
      "A native Michigan apple tree, the Malus coronaria, learned to fight frost by blooming two or three weeks later than the trees that produce cultivated varieties of apples like Honeycrisp or Red Delicious.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound like a lot, but almost always that\u2019s enough for the flowers to escape the killing spring frost,\u201d said Steve van Nocker, a Michigan State University professor and plant geneticist.",
      "Van Nocker wants to identify the genes responsible for the Malus coronaria\u2019s delayed blooms and use them to develop more frost-resistant apple varieties, a decades-long process. But first, he\u2019s hiking through forests, trying to find the elusive trees.",
      "Van Nocker\u2019s project is one of many ways researchers and growers are trying to make apples more resilient as climate change makes weather less predictable.",
      "In Europe and South Korea, growers are experimenting with solar panels in vineyards and orchards. The panels protect fruit from hail and sun damage but also let in light and heat when necessary, said Jared Buono, the director of Cornell University\u2019s Hudson Valley Research Lab. Buono\u2019s lab is also adding solar panels to its experimental orchard.",
      "University of Maryland researchers recently announced the development of a more heat-tolerant apple variety. At Penn State University, a team built an unmanned vehicle with a propane-fueled heater that can roll through an orchard and automatically warm trees.",
      "Buono said such efforts can mitigate the impact of unusual weather like a May 18, 2023 frost that damaged trees across New York state and cut apple production by 20%.",
      "\u201cGrowers\u2019 jobs are already hard,\u201d Buono said. \u201cThe change in climate, the increased unpredictability and variability, makes it that much harder.\u201d",
      "According to a Washington State University study published this month, major apple-growing counties in the top three U.S. apple-producing states -- Washington, Michigan and New York -- are seeing fewer cold days and more warm fall nights than they used to. Washington also is experiencing more extreme heat.",
      "The study, which examined climate data from 1979 to 2022, said the temperature trends could alter bloom timing, bring trees out of dormancy too early and increase the risk of sunburn, which hurts the appearance and quality of apples.",
      "That\u2019s why, on a chilly day in December, van Nocker and graduate assistant Lily \u201cKaz\u201d Christian hiked through a public park near Michigan State to check on a handful of Malus coronaria trees they had found there.",
      "Malus coronaria \u2013 also called sweet crabapple -- was once so common in Michigan its blossoms were designated as the state flower in 1897. But the species appears to be in decline, van Nocker said. Parking lots and shopping centers now stand in many of the places where the tree was documented in the past, and the remaining trees often produce little new growth or fruit.",
      "When they reached the trees, van Nocker and Christian cut off small pieces of the stems. The snippets will be tested to ensure they are fully Malus coronaria and not a hybrid. Then, these Malus coronaria cuttings \u2014 along with cuttings from previous hunts \u2014 will be grafted onto an apple rootstock. That will allow them to grow into trees which are identical to the original.",
      "However, the goal is not to replace popular varieties like Fuji or Honeycrisp with Malus coronaria apples, since the Michigan tree's fruit is small, green and bitter.",
      "\u201cTo me, they don\u2019t taste good at all,\u201d van Nocker said.",
      "Instead, he wants to identify the genes that cause late blooming and create a genetic stock that breeders could use to develop commercial apples. Van Nocker also is sending seeds to the U.S. Department of Agriculture so the genetic stock won\u2019t be lost if the tree continues to decline.",
      "Making a later-blooming commercial apple could take decades. If a Malus coronaria is crossed with a commercial apple tree to make a new hybrid, it would take four or five years for that tree to start producing apples. Crossbreeding would continue until researchers developed an apple with the desired traits of both varieties.",
      "But van Nocker said it\u2019s critical to try.",
      "\u201cWith climate change, it\u2019s quite possible that apples won\u2019t be able to be produced in Michigan in the future,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why cultivar improvement, especially in terms of frost resistance, is so important.\u201d",

      "In her first televised interview since her Jan. 8 release, Cecilia Sala referred to the three-nation negotiation that resulted in her freedom after 21 days in detention.",
      "Sala, 29, was arrested in Tehran just days after Italy detained an Iranian national, Mohammad Abedini, on a U.S. warrant and their fates became intertwined. After three weeks of negotiations that Premier Giorgia Meloni called \u201cdiplomatic triangulation,\u201d Sala went home and Abedini returned to Iran.",

The United States and Iran don\u2019t have diplomatic relations.",
      "\u201cYou understand that it\u2019s a case that concerns Iran, Italy, and the United States, so Elon Musk becomes a fundamental person,\u201d Sala said on the Sunday talk show \u201cChe Tempo Che Fa\u201d (What the Weather's Like\"). \u201cThe only response Daniele got from Andrea Stroppa was \u2018he is informed.\u2019\"",

      "While the negotiations were underway, Meloni flew to Mar-a-Lago and met with Trump. Stroppa has since tweeted a photoshopped image of Musk eating a plate of pasta, a reference to a reported promise by Sala's mother to cook Musk his favorite pasta the next time he is in Italy, to thank him for his intervention.",
      "Sala, deprived of news from the outside world, assumed she would have been held for much longer, given other Western prisoners have been held for over a year or more. She said she also feared Trump\u2019s arrival in the White House could have meant a much longer detention, because of regional tensions between Israel and Iran.",
      "\u201cIf Donald Trump had come out in the press saying publicly that he wanted particular retaliation against some Iranians, my situation could have been very complicated,\u201d she said. \u201cI was sure that I would be inside a lot more, because everybody else has been inside a lot more.\u201d",
      "Kept in solitary confinement without her glasses or contact lenses that she needs to see, Sala said she was interrogated while hooded, for up to 10 hours a day, by someone speaking \u201cperfect English\u201d and who knew a lot about Italy. She was denied an English-language Quran that she requested and said she felt reality slipping away.",
      "\u201cThere were these neon lights on for 24 hours a day. You lose faith in your head when you don\u2019t talk for days. You don\u2019t trust your memory and even responding to your interrogators becomes a pretty heavy psychological game,\u201d she said.",

      "But crypto has so far defied naysayers and survived multiple prolonged price drops in its short lifespan. Wealthy players in the crypto industry, which felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump win last November\u2019s election. Bitcoin has surged in price since Trump's victory, topping $100,000 for the first time last month before briefly sliding down to about $90,000. On Friday, it rose about 5%.

      "Crypto investors and companies chafed as what they said was a hostile Biden administration that went overboard in unfair enforcement actions and accounting policies that have stifled innovation in the industry \u2014 particularly at the hands of outgoing SEC Chairman Gary Gensler.",

      "Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires less than two weeks after deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and ravaged thousands of homes",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Southern Californians are bracing for gusty winds and a heightened risk of wildfires, less than two weeks after the outbreak of deadly blazes that have killed at least 27 people and charred thousands of homes.",
      "The National Weather Service has issued a warning of a \u201c particularly dangerous situation \u201d for parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties from Monday afternoon through Tuesday morning due to low humidity and damaging Santa Ana winds. Gusts could peak at 70 mph (113 kph) along the coast and 100 mph (160 kph) in the mountains and foothills.",
      "Windy weather and single-digit humidity are expected to linger through Thursday, said Rich Thompson, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service. He said the fire risk is also elevated because the region hasn\u2019t seen rain since April.",
      "Critical fire weather with wind gusts up to 60 mph (97 kph) was also forecast for Southern California communities stretching to San Diego on Monday and Tuesday, with residents urged to take steps to get ready to evacuate such as creating an emergency kit and keeping cars filled with at least a half tank of gas. A windblown dust and ash advisory was also issued, as high winds could disperse ash from existing fire zones across Southern California.",
      "The warnings come as firefighters continue to battle two major blazes in the Los Angeles area, the Palisades and Eaton fires, which have destroyed more than 14,000 structures since they broke out during fierce winds on Jan. 7. The Palisades fire was 52% contained on Sunday and the Eaton fire 81% contained, according to fire officials.",
      "Firefighters have made progress on the perimeter of the Palisades fire, which has blackened more than 37 square miles (96 square kilometers) near the Pacific coast, but there are areas in the interior that continue to burn, said Dan Collins, a spokesperson for the Palisades fire incident.",
      "\u201cThere is always a possibility in a red flag warning something hot, or some type of burning material from the interior, could be perhaps whipped up and blown across the containment lines,\u201d Collins said.",
      "While firefighters are fairly confident the Eaton fire further inland will remain contained, there are concerns a new fire could break out with vegetation especially dry for this time of year, said Carlos Herrera, an Eaton fire spokesperson.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has positioned fire engines, water-dropping aircraft and hand crews across the region to enable a quick response should a new fire break out, according to the governor's office of emergency services.",
      "\u201cThis proactive approach has proven to be a critical component of California\u2019s wildfire response strategy, reducing response times and containing fires before they escalate,\u201d the office said.",
      "Damage estimates have continued to climb for the Palisades and Eaton fires nearly two weeks since they began. Inspectors have fanned out to check buildings and assess damages, but Collins said it is impossible to know whether the remaining structures affected in the Palisades fire are intact.",
      "\u201cOur damage inspection teams have to inspect every structure within the fire perimeter,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThey're about two-thirds of the way done.\u201d",
      "Fire officials said they were focused on repopulating evacuated areas, with residents allowed to return Sunday to the hillside area of Pacific Palisades known as the highlands.",
      "Authorities said two people were arrested Saturday while attempting to enter an evacuation zone for the Palisades fire and are being investigated for impersonating firefighters. The pair were wearing turnout gear and claimed to be from an Oregon fire agency, but they weren't, and the truck they were driving had been bought at auction, the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department said in a statement."

      "The three main US indexes ended the day higher, while shares in Europe and Asia also made modest gains.",
      "While Trump did not announce widespread tariffs, he has ordered a review US trade deals, in a possible step toward the border taxes as well as threatening Canada and Mexico with 25% from 1 February.",
      "The International Monetary Fund and analysts have warned that Trump policies threaten a significant disruption of global trade that could eventually backfire on the US.",

      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people, Canada's a very bad abuser also, vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Trump said in the Oval Office.",

      "Rates are currently at 4.75%, but traders have bet on a cut to 4.5% in February, after inflation, which measures the rate prices rise at over time, unexpectedly fell last month.",

      "Ms Coles warned there was a risk rising wages could lead to higher inflation and interest rate cuts being delayed, but added \"on balance, the lack of growth in the economy, and a month of falling inflation, are likely to mean a rate cut in February is still on the cards\".",

      "The UK has had worker shortages for various sectors in recent years. This can drag on economic growth, but can also lead to workers in those industries securing higher pay deals as employers seek to attract them or current bosses try to retain them.",

    "summary": "Lord Rose says it harms productivity but expert says hybrid work can be as good as full-time in the office.",
    "story": [
      "Working from home is creating a generation who are \"not doing proper work\", the former boss of Marks and Spencer and Asda has warned.",
      "Lord Rose told BBC Panorama that home working was part of the UK economy's \"general decline\" and employees' productivity was suffering.",
      "His comments come as some companies are calling time on remote working. Amazon, Boots and JP Morgan are just some of the businesses who now require their head office staff to be in every day.",
      "However, work-from-home expert Prof Nicholas Bloom said that while fully remote work can be \"quite damaging\" to some workers' productivity, spending three days out of five in the office was as productive as fully office-based work overall.",
      "Lord Rose, who was chief executive of M&S and recently stepped down as the chairman of Asda, said: \"We have regressed in this country in terms of working practices, productivity and in terms of the country's wellbeing, I think, by 20 years in the last four.\"",
      "In a November 2024 GB snapshot survey by the Office for National Statistics, 26% of people said they had been hybrid-working in the prior seven days, with some days in the workplace and some days at home - while 14% had been fully remote and 41% had commuted to their workplace every day (the remainder were not working in the week surveyed).",
      "The shift to working from home has transformed local economies. Industry estimates indicate that vacant office space has nearly doubled since the pandemic, a quarter of dry-cleaning businesses have shut down, and the number of golf games played during the working week has risen 350% - suggesting some people are mixing work and pleasure.",
      "Working from home is rapidly becoming a major battleground in the culture wars. The government is currently legislating to strengthen the right of employees across the UK to request working from home and says that it intends to make it harder for employers to turn down requests.",
      "But some employers - including government bodies - are battling with staff to get them back into the office, arguing that face-to-face interaction is essential to collaborative working.",
      "In some cases, such as independent record label Hospital Records, this requires negotiation between a young workforce - some of whom may never have worked full-time in an office - and their older bosses.",
      "Company founder Chris Goss, who introduced a new policy requiring staff work three days in the office rather than two, said he had \"a nagging feeling\" that remote working has affected the company's bottom line.",
      "\"I firmly believe that the music industry is all about relationships, and so the one single way for any of us to be able to build those kind of meaningful relationships is to do it in person.\"",
      "Maya, a 25-year-old marketing manager at the company, said she likes being around her more experienced colleagues in the workplace. \"There's a lot of people in my team that are a lot further along in their career, so if I need help with something, you know, I can just ask someone.\"",
      "But she believes she would not be able to be in the office five days a week \"because my social battery drains and I need sometimes to be just at home and just to smash out loads of admin\".",
      "Prof Bloom, a Stanford University economist, said his research into working from home suggests employees in their teens and early 20s should probably be in the office at least four days a week to maximise their opportunities for being mentored.",
      "However, he said polls of tens of thousands of employees in the UK, US and Europe suggest workers valued the ability to work from home for two days a week about as much as an 8% pay rise.",
      "Employment rights minister Justin Madders told Panorama there was a growing body of evidence that working from home was more productive.

      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",

      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 00:07:03 GMT",
    "summary": "AI can take a second look at medical scans and flag up potential problems that doctors might not see.",
    "story": [
      "This is the sixth feature in a six-part series that is looking at how AI is changing medical research and treatments.",
      "When 58-year-old Will Studholme ended up in accident and emergency at an NHS hospital in Oxford in 2023 with gastrointestinal symptoms, he wasn't expecting a diagnosis of osteoporosis.",
      "The disease, strongly associated with age, causes bones to become weak and fragile, increasing the risk of fracture.",
      "It turned out that Mr Studholme had a severe case of food poisoning, but early in his ailment's investigation, he received an abdominal CT scan.",
      "That scan was then later run through artificial intelligence (AI) technology which identified a collapsed vertebra in Mr Studholme's spine, a common early indicator of osteoporosis.",
      "Further testing ensued, and Mr Studholme emerged not only with his diagnosis, but a simple treatment: an annual infusion of an osteoporosis drug that is expected to improve his bone density.",
      "\"I feel very lucky,\" says Mr Studholme, \"I don't think this would have been picked up without the AI technology.\"",
      "It isn't unheard of that a radiologist might note something incidental in a patient's imaging \u2013 an undetected tumour, a concern with a particular tissue or organ \u2013 outside of what they had originally been checking for.",
      "But applying AI in the background to systematically comb through scans and automatically identify early signs of common preventable chronic diseases that might be brewing \u2013 regardless of the reason the scan was originally ordered \u2013 is new.",
      "The clinical use of AI for opportunistic screening or opportunistic imaging, as it is called, \"is just beginning\" notes Perry Pickhardt, a professor of radiology and medical physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, who is among those developing the algorithms.",
      "It is considered opportunistic because it takes advantage of imaging that has already been done for another clinical purpose \u2013 be it suspected cancer, chest infection, appendicitis or belly pain.",
      "It has the potential to catch previously undiagnosed diseases in the early stages, before onset of symptoms, when they are easier to treat or prevent from progressing. \"We can avoid a lot of the lack of prevention that we have missed out on previously,\" says Prof Pickhardt.",
      "Regular physicals or blood tests often fail to pick up these diseases, he adds.",
      "There's a lot of data in CT scans related to body tissues and organs that we don't really use, notes Miriam Bredella, a radiologist at NYU Langone who is also developing algorithms in the field.",
      "And while analysis of it could theoretically be done without AI by radiologists making measurements \u2013 it would be time consuming.",
      "There are also benefits of the technology in terms of reducing bias, she notes.",
      "A disease like osteoporosis, for example, is thought of as mostly affecting thin, elderly white women \u2013 so doctors don't always think to look outside of that population.",
      "Opportunistic imaging, on the other hand, doesn't discriminate that way.",
      "Mr Studholme's case is a good example. Being relatively young for osteoporosis, male and with no history of broken bones, it is unlikely he would have been diagnosed without AI.",
      "In addition to osteoporosis, AI is being trained to help opportunistically identify heart disease, fatty liver disease, age-related muscle loss and diabetes.",
      "While the main focus is on CT scans, for example of the abdomen or chest, work is taking place to opportunistically glean information from other types of imaging too, including chest x-rays and mammograms.",
      "The algorithms are trained on many thousands of tagged previous scans, and it is important the training data includes scans from a wide swathe of ethnic groups if the technology is going to be deployed on a diverse range of people, stress the experts.",
      "And there is supposed to be a level of human review \u2013 if the AI finds something suspect it would be sent to radiologists to confirm before it is then reported on to doctors.",
      "How AI uncovers new ways to tackle difficult diseases",
      "AI is trained to spot warning signs in blood tests",
      "Why 'digital twins' could speed up drug discovery",
      "The AI technology used to examine Mr Studholme's scan belongs to Israeli company Nanox.AI, which is one of only a handful of companies working on AI for opportunistic screening - far more are focused on using AI to assist in the accurate and swift diagnoses of the specific conditions the scans are actually conducted for.",
      "Nanox.AI offers three opportunistic screening products aimed at helping identify osteoporosis, heart disease and fatty liver disease respectively from routine CT scans.",
      "Oxford NHS hospitals began trialling Nanox.AI's osteoporosis focused product in 2018 before officially rolling it out in 2020.",
      "Results from Oxford hospitals show an up to six-fold increase above the NHS average in the number of patients being identified with vertebral fractures \u2013 patients that can then be checked for osteoporosis, and start treatment to combat the disease, says Kassim Javaid, a professor of osteoporosis and rare bone diseases at the University of Oxford who has spearheaded the algorithm's introduction.",
      "Further trials of the algorithm are also now underway at hospitals in Cambridge, Cardiff, Nottingham, Southampton and Bradford. \"We want to build the evidence to use it across the NHS,\" says Prof Javaid.",
      "Yet while the technology can benefit individuals, there are wider ramifications that need to be considered says Sebastien Ourselin, a professor of healthcare engineering at Kings College London, who heads the AI Centre for Value Based Healthcare.",
      "A big problem that needs to be balanced, he notes, is the extra patient numbers that the use of the technology can create. \"This is increasing the demand on the healthcare system not reducing it,\" he says.",
      "First, people who are flagged by the opportunistic screening as potentially having a disease will likely need further confirmatory testing, which takes resources. And, if the AI is inaccurate or too sensitive, that could result in a lot of unnecessary testing.",
      "Then services need to be in place for those extra people that do end up being diagnosed.",
      "The extra load is a challenge that comes with the technology admits Prof Javaid \u2013 but there are solutions.",
      "Patients confirmed to have the fractures in Oxford are routed for follow up to a largely nurse delivered fracture prevention service so as not to overload doctors. \"The AI does force you to change your pathway,\" he says.",
      "And in the long run, believes Prof Javaid, to have a greater number of people with early-stage osteoporosis identified and receiving the preventative treatment they need will save the NHS money. \"Fracture is one of the top reasons people end up in hospital,\" he says.",
      "Mr Studholme has seen the devastation of osteoporosis first hand: it led to his mother breaking both her hips. It used to just be considered an old person's condition with nothing that could be done, he says. \"I feel quite privileged I can do something before my bones turn into chalk,\" he says."

      "She's recently returned to Guatemala in Central America from the US, where she was picking strawberries in California.",

      "\"It's so different to what I get paid in Guatemala, which is around $10 per day, when there's work.\"",
      "Sandra is one of around 5,000 Guatemalans who go and work \u2013 legally - in the US every year, thanks to a US government visa scheme for temporary agriculture workers from overseas, called H-2A.",
      "This allows US farms that cannot find enough locals to do the work to bring in staff from overseas. The foreign workers can stay for up to 12 months, before they then have to go back to their home countries.",
      "For people like Sandra it's a chance to get on in life, and to help her family by sending back some of the money she earns. In Guatemala there are now around 30 recruitment companies that are registered with the Guatemalan government to help people find temporary work in the US via H-2A visas.",
      "It's a cold, grey, windy day in southern Guatemala as Sanda proudly shows off the plot of land she rents in a place called Las Tres Cruces, high up in the hills near a town where she lives with her family, called Santiago Sacatep\u00e9quez.",
      "She and her relatives grow corn, lettuce, beans and spinach for them to eat. And if there's enough left over they sell them at the local market.  Sandra's dream is to save enough money to buy some land, so they don't have to rent.",

      "\"We paid someone $2,000 per person because we wanted to get work in the US,\" she says. \"My sister and I thought we needed to do this so we could move forward and make our dreams come true. So, we got a loan to get the money, but sadly it was all a scam, and they took our money.\"",
      "This is common practice for fraudsters in Guatemala, who play with people's desperation to get to the US, and trick them into handing over money.",
      "Cesia Ochoa is the executive director for the Guatemala branch of a legitimate recruitment company called Cierto. A business that also has offices in the US and Mexico, it is one of the 30 or so officially registered in Guatemala to offer H-2A visas.",
      "\"Part of our inspiration for opening an office in Guatemala was to help locals avoid the scams,\" she says.",
      "When Sandra went to the US via Cierto, she didn't have to pay it a fee. Instead, the company is paid by farm businesses in the US looking for temporary workers.",
      "Ms Ochoa explains: \"For us, it's really important that we make a good contact between businesses and the workers, and that the salaries and contract they are offering are real.\"",
      "While the H-2A visa allows people from Guatemala to legally find temporary farm work in the US, there is estimated to be more than 675,000 undocumented Guatemalans in the US, according to the Pew Research Center think tank.",
      "And a further 200,000 were found to have tried to enter the US without valid documentation in the 12 months to September of last year. That is the third highest number behind Mexicans and Venezuelans.",

      "A big problem is that to raise that amount of money many families need to take out loans secured against the value of their home. They can then lose their properties if the money isn't paid back.",
      "And that is often the case, given that the chance of them making it to the US is far from guaranteed, with the risk of accidents along the way, or being turned back at the US border.",
      "But the rewards are high. The money loved ones send back from the US is known as remittances, and these are propping up Guatemala's economy. In 2023 the country received $19.8bn in total remittances from abroad, according to one study from the Inter-American Development Bank.",
      "President Donald Trump has vowed to get tough on undocumented immigrants, and is threatening to carry out mass deportations .",

      "\"No one is trying to micromanage you, or look over your shoulder,\" says Mr Hoces, who works for a tech firm in Copenhagen. \"Bosses aren't coming in to check if you put in eight or nine hours a day, as they mainly only care if you completed your projects.",
      "\"There's a lot of trust in Denmark in that way, and I don't feel a hierarchy at my job. It's all very democratic.\"",
      "It is no surprise to Mr Hoces, a married father of two young daughters, that Denmark is consistently among the top-five countries in the world for work-life balance rankings.",
      "Only 1.1% of Danes have to work 50 or more hours a week, according to the most recent global figures from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). That's a significantly lower proportion than the world average of 10.2%.",
      "By contrast, the figure for the UK is 10.8% and the US is 10.4%.",
      "Meik Wiking, author of the book The Art of Danish Living, has long regarded his home country as a shining example of what other countries should aspire to mimic with their workplace policies.",
      "\"Danes are actually happy at work,\" he tells the BBC. \"Almost 60% of Danes say they would continue to work if they won the lottery and became financially independent.\"",
      "Mr Wiking, who is also the boss of Danish think tank The Happiness Research Institute, shares several policies that help generate a strong work-life balance in Denmark.",
      "These include the right to a minimum five weeks of paid annual leave per year, in addition to public holidays. In the UK most workers are entitled to 5.6 weeks of paid leave, but in the US it can be as low as  just 11 days.",
      "Denmark also offers a very generous six months of paid maternity and paternity leave. In the UK the father, or non-birthing partner, typically gets one to two weeks of paid leave.",
      "In the US there is only a federal guarantee of unpaid parental leave, although some states, such as California, now offer paid time away from work after the birth of a child. And federal employees can get 12-weeks of paid leave.",
      "Mr Wiking is another Dane who cites the concept of bosses trusting their employees to do the right thing. He uses the example of staff at the Tivoli Gardens amusement park in Copenhagen, where they follow the three-metre rule.",
      "The idea is that you are CEO of everything within a radius of three metres. \"If you see garbage within your three-metre radius you pick it up, and if you see a guest looking for something, you stop and ask them if you can help,\" says Mr Wiking.",
      "He adds that when staff take ownership of their own space it can help them feel empowered and appreciated, which goes a long way to contributing to a healthy sentiment about their workplace.",
      "Janine Leschke, a professor in the department of management, society and communication at the Copenhagen Business School, says Denmark is definitely \"not a work culture where you have to show up and be available all day, all evening, to show that you're working hard all the time\".",
      "Instead, she says flexibility during the workday gives employees the time they need to, say, pick up their children from school or day care. \"The day doesn't have to officially end at five or six, and that's appealing to a lot of Danes with kids.\"",
      "Mr Hoces has noticed how some employers in the US may expect their staff to be available over weekends, to answer the odd email or message. That kind of overtime doesn't fit with his outlook on a positive work-life balance.",
      "\"If I was expected to take calls on the weekend, that would be a huge red flag to me, and I would likely change jobs,\" he says. \"But so far that hasn't happened to me or anyone I know.\"",
      "Casper Rouchmann, a Copenhagen-based CEO and founder of tech firm SparkForce, says his relaxed leadership policy would be familiar to most Danes. \"You don't need to ask me to leave early,\" he says. \"No one takes advantage of my kindness.\"",
      "Mr Rouchmann adds that the element of trust is so ingrained in Danish culture, visitors to Denmark are often aghast at how far it can go. He also highlights Denmark's generous welfare state, and the fact that firms have to give financial compensation to staff who are made redundant.",
      "\"If you lose your job, the government is there to help,\" adds Mr Rouchmann.",
      "As much as other countries can learn from Denmark's work-life balance, he says it has some downsides. \"Some people can rely too much on that safety net, and it might say to them that they don't have to take real risks, which is why we can be less entrepreneurial compared to the US.\"",
      "Samantha Saxby, an American human resources expert, says Denmark has such a good work-life balance because the country \"prioritises collective well-being\".",
      "By contrast, she says the US \"has long emphasised individual achievement and ambition, which has driven tremendous innovation, but often at the cost of work-life balance\".",
      "Yet Ms Saxby, who is director of marketing for the US National Human Resources Association, says that companies in the US and elsewhere around the world may be finally following the lead of Denmark and the other equally happy Nordic nations.",
      "\"Progressive organisations are introducing benefits like unlimited paid time off, mental health days, and wellness programs, to encourage employees to prioritise self-care,\" she says. \"These measures not only alleviate pressure, but also demonstrate that employers value their workforce's overall well-being.",
      "\"More companies are recognising that well-rested and balanced employees bring fresh ideas, better problem-solving skills, and greater engagement.  Employees are beginning to feel empowered to take the time they need without sacrificing career growth.\"",

      "\"He's entitled to an education, so for him to just get pushed back when we've done everything right is just annoying\", said Kray.",

      "Councils have a legal time limit of 20 weeks, in most cases, to issue an EHCP or explain why the bid has been rejected after a professional asks for an assessment, but growing demand and insufficient funding is resulting in delays.",
      "The 33-year-old said without an EHCP he could not apply for a specialist school before the window for school applications closed this month.",
      "Kray said he felt a mainstream school would not be able to cope with his son.",
      "Bodhi displays many of the signs of autism including not speaking, not responding to his name, not being able to sit still and not interacting with other children or adults.",
      "Both he and his wife Sacha, who is also a chef, first started noticing the signs when he was one year old, and his nursery picked up on it too.",
      "Now that the school application window has closed, they fear they have missed their opportunity to get him a place at a specialist school, many of which are oversubscribed.",
      "Their concern is that if the school they have applied to cannot cope with Bodhi, he will be out of school and will have to be educated at home.",
      "For the couple, who have three young children and work full-time running their Michelin-listed restaurant, home-schooling is not a viable option.",
      "\"Obviously the children come first but we need that business to just live a nice life,\" said Kray.",
      "Data from the Department for Education shows that hundreds of other children in Birmingham are also facing delays to the support they need.",
      "In 2023 the city council's rate for getting EHCPs issued on time was 58.9% (652 of 1,107).",
      "That was better than the national average for that year, which was 49.1%",
      "To give Bodhi the best possible chance of getting into a good specialist school, the family have now moved out of Birmingham to Burton-upon-Trent, Staffordshire, and have asked the local county council for the educational needs assessment.",
      "But without the EHCP they are in the same position as they were in Birmingham.",
      "Sacha said she wondered how anyone got their children into a specialist school from reception age.",
      "The 29-year-old said they had begun the process to see a paediatrician when Bodhi was two and did everything their end as quickly as possible.",

      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",
      "\"I'm almost scared to have him as a granddad, because I want my kids to think I'm cool, too.\""

    "summary": "The children's laureate says a \"recession in children's happiness\" is caused by a decline in reading.",
    "story": [
      "Best-selling author Frank Cottrell-Boyce, the current children's laureate, is to spearhead a campaign to tackle a \"recession in children's happiness\" that he believes is caused by a decline in reading at a young age.",
      "The writer has organised a summit in Liverpool on Wednesday, at which he will call on the government to \"stand up and give a visible sign this country values its children\".",
      "Cottrell-Boyce, whose books include Millions and Cosmic, will warn that while children in the UK may fare well in reading league tables, reading for pleasure is in decline, leading to \"less chance of [them] being happy\".",
      "The Reading Rights Summit will also hear from fellow authors Cressida Cowell and Michael Rosen, two of his predecessors as children's laureate.",
      "Cottrell-Boyce will implore politicians \"to make sure that every single child has access to books, reading and the transformative ways in which they improve long-term life chances\".",
      "The author will add that \"our children are near the top of the global leagues when it comes to the mechanical skill of reading but near the bottom when it comes to 'reading for pleasure.'",
      "\"That our children seem to be experiencing some kind of happiness recession at the moment is not surprising, and I believe that the decline in reading has played its part in this.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC ahead of his speech, the writer emphasised the benefits of help with reading in early years. \"It's easy to get depressed about the situation, but there's a huge amount of happiness and optimism to be drawn on,\" he said.",
      "A 2022 BookTrust survey of over 2,000 low-income families in England, Wales and Northern Ireland found less than half of children under seven are being read a bedtime story.",
      "Disadvantaged children who achieve highly at the end of primary school are twice as likely to have been read to at home in their early years compared with their peers, the charity found.",
      "Cottrell-Boyce described the \"invisible privilege\" of being read to from a young age as \"not something that people have seen the importance of, and if you have it, then you're at a huge advantage over other people\".",
      "Screen time is also an issue. In his speech, he will say he has heard about some children who \"instead of turning the pages, try to swipe them or make the pictures grow bigger with their fingers\" because they hadn't encountered a book before starting school.",
      "He will also say: \"Yes, it's important for educational attainment. Yes, DCMS (Department for Culture, Media and Sport), it's the most crucial - and most democratic - part of our cultural heritage.",
      "\"Shared reading is an effective, economic health intervention, so yes, it's essential, [Health Secretary] Wes Streeting, to mental health, to bonding, to attachment, to creating a situation where parents and carers can give the best, the most joyous start in life to our children.\"",
      "He told the BBC he had \"incredibly happy memories\" of his own childhood.",
      "But in hindsight, he realised his mum was finding life difficult living in a small flat with her own mother and two young boys.",
      "\"Her solution was, she took us to the library a lot. I don't think she was hoping to hothouse us. I think she just wanted to get out and have somewhere nice to sit!",
      "\"I've just got these unbelievably happy memories... so that's what makes me passionate about happiness.\"",
      "Many children's laureates have campaigned on similar issues, but Cottrell-Boyce told the BBC he was aiming his message more at the government than the public.",
      "He added: \"We're not talking about a huge undertaking. Some of the most amazing stuff I've seen, in terms of capital spend, has been some Pritt stick and two copies of [Rod Campbell's classic toddler book] Dear Zoo.",
      "\"The infrastructure is there but it's not joined up.\"",
      "The summit, organised with children's reading charity BookTrust, will also hear from Rachel de Souza, the government's children's commissioner, and a report will be issued afterwards.",
      "A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"High and rising standards, with excellent foundations in reading, writing and maths and making sure tens of thousands more children start school ready to learn are key parts of our Plan for Change to ensure every child can achieve and thrive.",
      "\"We've invested over \u00a390 million in our English Hubs programme, which supports reading for pleasure, with a further \u00a323 million committed for the 2024-25 academic year and we have extended early language support.\"",

      "Fourth Wing introduced heroine Violet Sorrengail, a 20-year-old woman who is thrust into brutal training to become an elite dragon rider.",
      "Like the author, Violet has a genetic condition that means the character dislocates joints and breaks bones easily - so must use her wits and inner strength to help her survive.",

      "Iron Flame was then set during Violet's second year at Basgiath War College, while in Onyx Storm, according to the publisher, she \"knows there's no more time for lessons\" because \"the battle has truly begun\"."

      "But no inauguration day is without its surprises, and no programme of events - no matter how meticulously planned - can account for the weird, the wacky and the fascinating moments. Here's what you might have missed - and what people might still be talking about for days to come.",
      "Maga meets American Idol",
      "After Trump's inaugural address concluded, country singer Carrie Underwood arrived on stage to sing the patriotic song America the Beautiful.",
      "Underwood, who launched to fame after winning the TV talent show American Idol in 2005, had faced criticism for her decision to perform at the ceremony, particularly among opponents of Trump.",
      "\"I love our country and am honoured to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event,\" she said in a media statement last week. \"I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.\"",
      "Underwood's performance didn't start out smoothly - a technical malfunction cut off backing music just as she was to perform.",
      "\"You know the words, help me out here, \" she said after a few moments waiting for the music to return.",
      "The crowd in the rotunda joined her in signing an a cappella version of America the Beautiful that ended with applause.",

      "What's an inauguration day without a little romance?",
      "Melania Trump arrived in a dark blue and white ensemble, complete with an eye-catching hat. As our fashion writer noted, hats have long been a staple of First Lady inauguration dressing and Monday's hat was a fresh addition to the genre.",
      "The wide brim hid the famously inscrutable first lady's eyes, putting literal distance between her and other attendees, including her husband.",
      "In one of the more awkward moments of the day, Donald Trump greeted his closest allies as he walked on stage to his swearing-in at the Capitol. When he reached his wife, he leaned in for a kiss, only to find her hat brim made it hard to get close enough to Melania's face.",
      "The couple settled on an air kiss instead.",

      "The bros on the bus",
      "Is it possible to fit the entire \"manosphere\" on a single bus? Probably not, but if there was a time to try, it was the 2025 Trump inauguration.",
      "YouTuber-turned-wrestler Logan Paul and his brother Jake Paul, a professional boxer and influencer, spent the morning documenting their trip to Washington DC on Instagram. The brothers shared video from inside a chartered bus where Trump's boys-club was celebrating. Among them were Theo Von, the mulleted comedian and podcast host who interviewed Trump this autumn, internet prankster Kyle Forgeard and Conor McGregor, the controversial Irish mixed-martial arts fighter.",
      "They were some of the VIPs invited to watch the ceremony in a viewing area in the Capitol complex's Emancipation Hall.",
      "A group of hyper-masculine, ultra-online young men dubbed the \"manosphere\" has emerged as a growing faction amongst Trump's diverse mix of supporters.",
      "Trump ultimately won the election 56% to 42% among male voters ages 18-29 - a voting bloc he lost by 15 percentage points in 2020. This demographic helped deliver him the presidency - so it's not much of a surprise to see its prominent figures sharing in the celebration.",

      "But sometimes it's the lack of style that draws the most attention - the anti-fashion.",
      "In 2020, independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders stole the show with his utilitarian coat and patterned mittens - a gift from a constituent - that went viral for their contrast to a day of pomp and circumstance.",
      "But mittens? That's so 2020.",
      "This year, Senator John Fetterman donned perhaps the most unique outfit of the day - his signature oversized hoodie, long, loose athletic shorts and sneakers.",
      "It's a look the Pennsylvania Democrat is famous for - he wears it almost daily and even prompted a change in Senate dress code.",
      "Much of the chatter focused on why Fetterman eschewed a coat and opted for shorts on a day so frigid, the inauguration events were moved indoors. Forecasters have predicted lows of -11C (12F).",
      "In 2017, Fetterman explained to CNN that he dressed out of comfort and found it challenging to find more formal attire for his 6ft 8in frame.",
      "\"Nobody has come to me directly and said the world will burn if you wear a hoodie,\" he said, adding that his work spoke for itself.",

      "Inauguration Day for Donald Trump kicked off by going to church.",
      "But the traditional service isn't just about worship - it's also about who the incoming president chooses to fill the pews with him at a more intimate event.",
      "The morning service was a who's who of the faces that will help shape Trump's second administration - like his children and cabinet picks including Attorney General nominee Pam Bondi and Department of Defense nominee Pete Hegseth.",
      "Beside them, the giants of America's tech industry filled out a billionaire's pew: Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg; Amazon head Jeff Bezos; Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent company Alphabet; and Tim Cook, the Apple CEO that Trump once referred to as \"Tim Apple\".",
      "They later accompanied Trump to the Capitol's rotunda, again as part of a select group given near-front row access to the incoming president.",
      "Tesla/X/SpaceX mogul Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who will soon run his own cost-cutting advisory group for his administration, joined them.",
      "Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAl, was also seen at the Capitol.",
      "Notably, the inauguration overlaps with this year's World Economic Forum in Switzerland - typically a gathering place for tech executives to mingle and assert their influence. Seems the place to be this year wasn't Davos - it was Washington DC.",

      "Former presidential rival Hillary Clinton was seen in crowd behind President Trump, listening as he shared his plans for America to \"reclaim its rightful place as the greatest, most powerful, most respected nation on Earth, inspiring the awe and admiration of the entire world\".",
      "\"A short time from now, we are going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America,\" he said to applause.",
      "Seated between her husband former President Bill Clinton and former President George W Bush, Clinton could be seen laughing at that last line. Reaction online was split, with Trump critics delighting in the moment and Trump supporters decrying it as rude.",
      "It is a controversial proposal that has become a key piece of Trump's vision for US foreign policy in his second term. Among other ideas, Trump has sought to rename the internationally recognised body of water as a means of punishing Mexico over immigration, economic and drug trade-related grievances.",
      "The view from the top of bag mountain",
      "On Friday, forecasts of bitter cold and punishing winds prompted Trump to call for a venue change, turning the traditionally outdoor event into a more private indoor affair. Public ticketholders were instead directed to gather at Washington DC's Capital One Arena, an indoor sports and concert venue.",
      "But some were not expecting the bag-size rules that come with the venue shift. As the arena filled up, images flowed out of piles of discarded bags, water bottles and other items deemed too large or too risky to be allowed inside.",
      "Initial guidance provided by Capitol Police prohibited bags larger than 12in x 12in x 5in from the Capitol grounds for the inauguration, but the arena appears to have stricter requirements.",
      "Purses and backpacks of all sizes were heaped on the street outside, apparently abandoned. Some appeared to be from designer brands, including Coach and Louis Vuitton.",

      "Ten years later, she is one of thousands of grassroots, professional musicians struggling to weather the storm of the cost-of-living crisis. And she thinks their plight has been overlooked.",
      "\"Everyone is human and I sometimes think people forget musicians are human as well - we are people too with bills to pay,\" she said.",
      "While the absence of consistent pay has long been a concern for the performer and others like her, rising living costs have exacerbated the issue. Maintaining equipment, booking rehearsal space and covering travel costs has become more expensive for artists, while venues and gig-goers alike are tightening their budgets as they feel the squeeze.",
      "For Ms Saskia, who relies solely on her music income, the rates she gets paid no longer add up.",
      "She will often travel to and from a performance to find she used up the night's income to pay for that journey.",
      "\"Sometimes you'll only get paid what your phone bill is and then sometimes it will only cover your travel and your food,\" she said.",
      "\"Once I've fed myself and travelled back home, I still have to think about how I'm going to put money towards rent and bills.\"",
      "Kelley Phillips sings as Kelley Tigerheart at pubs, clubs and events within 50 miles of her home in Nantwich, Cheshire.",
      "She also teaches dancing twice a week and has picked up a part-time job to supplement her income.",
      "That, she said, had \"increased my time working, which has given me less leisure time\".",
      "\"[But] I have had no other choice as a single woman living alone but to get other jobs.\"",
      "Ms Phillips said things had \"slowed down\" over the past year due to pubs being more careful with their budgets, causing her to negotiate more and offer discounts.",
      "But she said she would never give up performing and advised others looking to enter the industry to plan and budget meticulously.",
      "\"I always encourage people to go for their passions and do what they love,\" she said.",
      "Jess Harper, marketing manager at Coventry venue The Tin, described grassroots venues as \"incredibly essential\" to budding artists.",
      "But it is not easy for these premises. \"Lots of venues are facing rent increases, price increases everywhere. It's a struggle for a lot of venues,\" Ms Harper explained.",
      "The venue is raising money to refurbish the front of the building with more than \u00a36,000 donated so far. Ms Harper said the venue was lucky to have so much support from regulars.",
      "Asked how vital The Tin was to the city, she said: \"It's really important, we would not get the bigger artists we have with these grassroots music venues.\"",
      "She said initiatives like the Music Venue Trust's proposal for a \u00a31 levy on arenas could help smaller venues with rising costs.",
      "'Art needs to be respected'",
      "According to the Help Musicians charity, 44% of the 6,000 people interviewed for its 2023 Musicians' Census cited the lack of a sustainable income as a barrier to their career.",
      "Meanwhile, 23% of musicians said they were unable to support themselves or their families, while venues tightened budgets.",
      "This has contributed to a third of artists reporting low mental wellbeing, according to the charity.",
      "But its director of services and research Laurie Oliva said musicians were \"resilient\", as 81% reported they would still be in the industry in five years.",
      "\"As fans, it's important we support artists where we can by buying tickets and merch, going to shows, and subscribing to initiatives,\" she added.",
      "In the meantime, Ms Saskia says more investment is needed in infrastructure to secure the future of the arts.",
      "She believes the arts are among the most \"disrespected\" subjects on the curriculum in schools, and says attitudes need to change to encourage more young people into artistic industries.",
      "\"Music is the backdrop for every memory. You can attach music to a person, a feeling, it can help you heal, it can help you get through your bad times and good days,\" she said.",

      "\"I never thought I could actually be a 'pop star girl' and Pink Pony forced me into that.\"",
      "Her label disagreed. They refused to release Pink Pony Club for two years. Shortly after they relented, Roan was dropped in a round of pandemic-era cost-cutting.",
      "Bruised but not broken, she went back home and spent the next year serving coffee in a drive-through doughnut shop.",
      "\"It absolutely had a positive impact on me,\" she says. \"You have the knowledge of what it's like to clean a public restroom. That's very important.\"",
      "The period was transformational in other ways. She saved her earnings, had her heart broken by a person \"with pale blue eyes\", moved back to Los Angeles, and gave herself a year to make it.",
      "It might have taken a little longer than that, but she hit the ground running.",
      "During her exile, Roan had stayed in touch with her Pink Pony Club co-writer, Daniel Nigro.",
      "He was also working with another up-and-coming singer called Olivia Rodrigo and, when her career took off, Roan got a courtside seat, supporting Rodrigo on tour and providing backing vocals on her second album, Guts.",
      "More importantly, Nigro used the momentum to sign Roan to his own record label and ensure the release of her debut album in September 2023.",
      "At first, it seemed like Roan's original label had been right. Sales were disappointing and audiences were slow to catch on because her in-your-face queer anthems were out of step with the trend for whispery, confessional pop.",
      "But those songs came to life on stage. Big, fun and designed for audience participation, they're taken to new heights by Roan's powerhouse voice and flamboyant stage persona.",
      "\"A drag queen does not get on stage to calm people down,\" she says. \"A drag queen does not say things to flatter people. A queen makes you blush, you know what I mean? Expect the same energy at my show.\"",
      "Sure enough, it was a live-streamed appearance at last year's Coachella Festival that pushed her into the upper echelons of pop.",
      "Dressed in a PVC crop top that declared \"Eat Me\", she played the packed Gobi tent like a headliner, strutting purposefully across the stage and coaching the audience in the campy choreography for Hot To Go.",
      "Then she stared directly into the camera and dedicated a song to her ex.",
      "\"Bitch I know you're watching\u2026 and all those horrible things happening to you are karma.\"",
      "The clip went viral and, before long, her career did, too.",
      "By the summer, all of her shows had been upgraded. Festivals kept having to move her to bigger stages. When she played Lollapalooza in August, she drew the event's biggest ever daytime crowd.",
      "\"It just takes a decade,\" she says. \"That's what I tell everyone. 'If you're OK with it taking 10 years, then you're good'.\"",
      "As fans discovered her debut album, Roan also released a standalone single - a sarcastic slice of synth-pop called Good Luck Babe, which became her breakout hit.",
      "\"I don't even know if I've ever said this in an interview, but it was originally called Good Luck, Jane,\" she reveals.",
      "\"I wanted it to be about me falling in love with my best friend, and then her being like, 'Ha ha ha, I don't like you back, I like boys.'",
      "\"And it was like, 'OK, well, good luck with that, Jane'.\"",
      "A masterclass in pop storytelling, Good Luck Babe has a proper three-act structure, with a killer pay-off in the middle eight and a chorus you just can't shake.",
      "Still, Roan was shocked by its success.",
      "\"I just threw it out, like, I don't know what this is going to do \u2013 and it carried the whole year!\"",
      "The question, of course, is what the star does next, now that she's the Sound of 2025.",
      "She's already previewed two new songs, The Subway and The Giver, in concert \u2013 but all she will reveal about a second album is that she's \"more reluctant to be sad or dark\".",
      "\"It feels so good to party,\" she explains.",
      "Looking back at the last 12 months, she's philosophical about what it means to be pop's hottest new commodity.",
      "\"A lot of people think fame is the pinnacle of success, because what more could you possibly want than adoration?\"",
      "Roan does admit that the admiration of strangers is more \"addictive\" than she'd expected.",
      "\"Like, I understand why I'm so scared to lose this feeling.",
      "\"It's so scary to think that one day people will not care about you the same way as they do right now - and I think [that idea] lives in women's brains a lot different than men's.\"",
      "Ultimately, she decides, success and failure are \"out of my control\". Instead, she wants to make good choices.",
      "\"If I can look back and say, 'I did not crumble under the weight of expectation, and I did not stand for being abused or blackmailed', [then] at least I stayed true to my heart,\" she says.",

    "published": "Mon, 20 Jan 2025 10:00:50 GMT",
    "summary": "The rapper's second album following his death has been welcomed by fans, with producers saying it remains authentic.",
    "story": [
      "For the second time in the seven years since his death, Mac Miller fans have the chance to listen to a new album.",
      "The US rapper was 26 when he died from an accidental overdose in 2018. Friends say he was lost in his prime and fans' hunger for new music has remained.",
      "Balloonerism, released on Friday to generally positive reviews, follows the 2020 posthumous release of Circles, made of unfinished work completed after he died.",
      "Collaborators say the studio tracks first laid down more than 10 years ago used in the new album have barely been changed.",
      "Some of those who worked on the new release - who were present at the recording sessions - describe the finished product as haunting, raw, and unpolished.",
      "Circles was a big success but a mixed reception to recent posthumous albums from other artists has caused critics to question whether less is more when it comes to releasing music after death.",
      "Audio engineer Josh Berg was in the LA studio, known as the Sanctuary, where Mac wrote and recorded all his material between 2013-2014.",
      "\"I always hoped this day would come,\" he says of Ballonerism's final release.",
      "\"And now it's kind of sad.",
      "\"Everything except one thing is amazing about this situation. It really makes me feel his loss.\"",
      "Mac Miller, real name Malcolm James McCormick, was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and started making music at school.",
      "His debut album, Blue Slide Park, was the first independently released record to top the Billboard 200 chart in 16 years and all of his later albums followed the same path to the top five in the US.",
      "He wrote Balloonerism between labels in 2014 and producer Eric Dan, who worked with Mac since he was a teenager, tells Newsbeat he was \"just starting to come into his own\".",
      "\"That period was like a creative renaissance for him,\" he says. \"He was a creation machine.\"",
      "Josh says so many projects were started in that time but Balloonerism was among the ones that came closest to release, with Mac even getting to the stage of commissioning artwork.",
      "While Circles was \"in pretty rough shape\" when he died and finished off by producers, Eric says Balloonerism is largely untouched.",
      "\"We made a conscious decision to keep things as they were and not go back and 'fix' mistakes, tune things or add anything.",
      "\"The rough edges were part of its charm and highlighted where Mac was creatively at that time.\"",
      "Josh describes the result of leaving in those imperfections as an album that's \"raw and emotional\", even \"extremely haunting\" in the context of Mac's death.",
      "\"Once you start pulling everything apart and dusting it off, it starts to lose its magic,\" Josh says.",
      "\"It's beautiful to release an album that's not so scoured of imperfection, that's authentic and real.\"",
      "It's that question of authenticity which troubles some fans about music released after an artist has died.",
      "In 2024, posthumous albums released by the families of SOPHIE and Juice WRLD had mixed responses. While SOPHIE's was named Rough Trade's album of the year, some critics considered it too \"safe\" for such a pioneering and experimental talent.",
      "Robin Murray, editor-in-chief at Clash magazine, reviewed Juice WRLD's third posthumous album, The Party Never Ends.",
      "The US rapper died two years after Mac, also from an accidental overdose, leaving a cache of unreleased music but Robin tells Newsbeat the latest album sounded like \"unfinished demos that had been stretched\".",
      "\"Releasing an album or body of work after an artist has passed away is an incredibly difficult and complex task,\" he says.",
      "\"There's no telling how the artist would have proceeded with that work, if they would have proceeded at all.\"",
      "Josh and Eric agree it's fair to question how Mac might have changed Balloonerism but they both believe it was always his plan to be release it when the time was right.",
      "Eric also says that after \"bootleg\" versions of the album were leaked, it was important an official release, in line with Mac's most up-to-date track lists, allowed the family to regain control of the album.",
      "\"I can certainly see where people have concerns with it,\" Josh accepts.",
      "\"I was less concerned but now in this process maybe I shared more of that concern as we got closer.",
      "\"He would always change the playlist, he would always do something I'd never expect, so it will never really be true to him.\"",
      "'Brushing away the myth'",
      "The release of Balloonerism coincides with what would have been Mac's 33rd birthday and a companion film was shared alongside it.",
      "At a sold-out screening in London, fan Conor says it felt like the last opportunity to \"share thanks for the artist that he was\".",
      "Most of the fans who spoke to Newsbeat say they had no reservations about the album being released but Conor says the passage of more than 10 years \"does make it more complex\".",
      "\"It's sad, at some point it does have to end but I'm all here for it for now.\"",
      "Another fan, Carolina, says she \"didn't give it too much thought, because I'm just a sucker\".",
      "\"I just want more, everything he made and was ready to be released, I'd like to be released.\"",
      "Robin says the success of Circles was in part due to how closely Mac's family worked with people who knew him.",
      "Eric, for example, worked on all his music and knew him for a decade, while Josh \"pretty much lived in the studio\" with Mac during the writing and recording sessions.",
      "He says the family \"really lead the way in showing how tenderness and care can be accomplished within posthumous projects\".",

      "However Robin says it's important to know when enough is enough.",

      "Worried about what's going to fill the gap once The Traitors ends on Friday? Fear not - the US version drops on Friday, with an all-star cast descending on the Scottish Highlands.",
      "But that's not the only thing to look forward to this week. Little Mix star Jade Thirlwall will be talking to Louis Theroux about new music, Harry Styles and more.",
      "Plus, The Brutalist is coming to UK cinemas, actress Naomi Watts is due to release a book, and FKA twigs's new album is out.",
      "Read on for this week's biggest releases...",
      "Your next Traitors fix",
      "Hot on the heels of the UK final on Friday, the third season of The Traitors US is arriving on BBC iPlayer.",
      "Five episodes will be available to stream on Friday, after which there will be a new episode available every Friday.",
      "Unlike the UK series, the contestants on the US version are celebrities. The series two cast was primarily made up of US reality stars - with the additions of British Love Island winner Ekin-Su C\u00fclc\u00fclo\u011flu and former House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.",
      "Players competing for the cash prize this time include Britney Spears' ex-husband Sam Asghari, former WWE wrestler Nikki Garcia and British aristocrat Lord Ivar Mountbatten.",
      "The show is filmed at the same castle as the UK version but in place of Claudia Winkleman, Scottish actor Alan Cumming presents. Don't worry, his outfits are just as fabulous.",
      "Jade Thirlwall talks new music... and Harry Styles",
      "Jade Thirlwall waited the longest of any member of Little Mix to release solo music, but she's given fans plenty to get stuck into recently.",
      "In July, she dropped debut single Angel of My Dreams, and she kicked off 2025 with a banger: a dance-pop track called It girl, which appears to take a swipe at the wider music industry.",
      "On Tuesday, she's appearing on Louis Theroux's podcast, which will be available on Spotify.",
      "I'm told it's going to be a \"candid\" conversation, in which Jade will discuss her early career and the X Factor era - including a date with Harry Styles.",
      "Other topics on the agenda include fellow bandmate Jesy Nelson's departure from Little Mix, her experience of an eating disorder, her boyfriend (Rizzle Kicks star Jordan Stephens, in case you haven't been following), and her new album.",
      "However good it is, it surely can't top her interview on podcast Sidetracked last year, in which she confessed she had a \"poo incident\" on stage with Little Mix. You can listen back to that on BBC Sounds.",
      "Is The Brutalist too long?",
      "The Brutalist has already won three prizes at the Golden Globes, and picked up nine Bafta film nominations.",
      "The film, which is also tipped to be a big contender at the Oscars, is released in UK cinemas this Friday.",
      "Starring Adrien Brody, Guy Pearce and Felicity Jones, it tells the tale of a Hungarian architect who is hired by a wealthy American after World War Two.",
      "It's also really long: 215 minutes including a 15-minute intermission in the middle.",
      "I grew up watching Bollywood films, so a lengthy film doesn't spook me.",
      "But my colleague Lizo Mzimba asked director Brady Corbet for his take on the duration.",
      "\"I think that's something you can't concern yourself with. You have to do what's right for the project,\" he said.",
      "\"The length of a movie is similar to the length of a book, a double album, a painting on a big canvas. I love small portraits and I love [German painter] Anselm Kiefer. For me, there's a space for both of them.",
      "\"And at the end of the day, especially if the film has an intermission, it's only 100 minutes on each side so it's not so bad.\"",
      "Lizo's also interviewed the stars of the show - watch out for that later this week.",
      "Have you experienced Eusexua?",
      "FKA twigs coined the phrase Eusexua to describe a feeling of euphoria that is like transcending the human form.",
      "Just \"don't call it love\", she writes, in her song by the same name.",
      "Eusexua is also the title of her upcoming third studio album, due out on Friday.",
      "It's inspired by the techno rave scene in Prague, and is pronounced you-sex-you-uh, in case you were wondering.",
      "Ever since it was announced, there have been near-constant memes.",
      "But many have also expressed their thanks to the singer, that this word now exists.",
      "\u201cStill can't believe that the word Eusexua was literally never heard or used by a human before FKA twigs\u2026\u201d, wrote one X user.",

      "Now 56, she has written a book about her experiences and providing advice for other women.",
      "In Dare I Say It, she says she was initially wary about writing about menopause because she feared negative repercussions for her career.",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:57:01 GMT",
    "summary": "Prince Harry\u2019s legal battle against British tabloids for allegedly unlawfully intruding into his life reaches its most important moment on Tuesday.",
    "story": [
      "Unless there is a sudden and staggering plot twist, Prince Harry's legal battle against British tabloids for allegedly unlawfully intruding into his life reaches its most important moment on Tuesday when his claims against The Sun and the long-closed News of the World, come to trial.",
      "The plot twist would be a settlement of his mammoth case against their parent, News Group Newspapers [NGN], the British press arm of the media empire founded by Rupert Murdoch.",
      "Is it likely? You would get better odds on Harry and Meghan announcing a weekly lifestyle column for The Sun on Sunday.",
      "This will be the first time that News Group Newspapers has had to defend itself against allegations that its journalists and executives across the whole organisation were involved in or knew about unlawful newsgathering techniques.",
      "If it were to lose, and lose badly, a finding from the court of corporate-level wrongdoing would be in stark contrast to a longstanding defence that phone hacking was limited to bad apples in one now-closed title.",
      "The prince's allegations of tabloid wrongdoing date back to 1996. Harry and his brother Prince William first became aware they may have been targeted in 2006.",
      "Back then, texting was still in its infancy and everybody left voicemails - and some tabloid journalists realised it was rather easy to listen in.",
      "Clive Goodman, a News of the World journalist, and Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, were arrested, and later jailed, for intercepting voicemails on phones belonging to the princes' aides.",
      "Prince Harry says as the scandal deepened, he held on for NGN to settle Royal Family claims under a \"secret agreement\" to avoid embarrassment in court. NGN's lawyers have said this is \"Alice in Wonderland stuff\" - and the court has ruled it hasn't seen evidence of such a backroom deal.",
      "All these years on, the Duke of Sussex seems in no mood to give up on what has become a crusade against tabloid journalism. And so his case is going ahead - and what happens over the next two months may define both the prince's legacy and the future of a British journalism institution.",
      "NGN long ago apologised for unlawful practices at the News of the World and closed it down in 2011. It denies similar claims against The Sun - and the duke's wider allegation of a corporate-wide cover-up.",
      "It has settled cases brought by some 1,300 claimants, to the tune of around \u00a31bn including legal costs.",
      "That means it has seen off potential trials from people who say the newspapers ran stories that could have only been written with access to private or confidential sources of information that could not have been publicly known.",
      "Those settlements left just two claimants - one of them Prince Harry.",
      "When he launched his claim, he alleged that more than 200 articles published by NGN between 1996 and 2011 contained information gathered by illegal means. The trial will look at a sample of around 30 stories in detail.",
      "Some of those will cover ground trodden in his successful Mirror Group case in 2023 and, just like in that case, he will give evidence in person.",
      "There will be hours of analysis of how the Sun got scoops such as \"Emotional Harry rang Chelsy at midnight\" - a story it ran almost twenty years ago to the day about his then girlfriend, Chelsy Davy.",
      "There will be further separate allegations from the second claimant, Lord (Tom) Watson. The former Labour MP says his phone was targeted around the time he was investigating the Murdoch newspapers at the height of the scandal almost 15 years ago.",
      "Mr Justice Fancourt will decide if any of the NGN articles were the product of unlawful information gathering, such as information tricked or \"blagged\" out of phone companies by private investigators.",
      "In Prince Harry's case, he will not rule on whether there was any phone hacking because Prince Harry ran out of legal time to bring those allegations to trial.",
      "None of this is going to be simple in court.",
      "The judge had repeatedly expressed his frustration, referring to the two sides as entrenched well-resourced armies refusing to give any ground to each other.",
      "And at no stage has Prince Harry looked like he was going to settle, despite the enormous financial hit he faces by not doing so.",
      "If a claimant turns down an offer of settlement and is later awarded less in damages by a judge, they have to pay the legal costs of both sides.",
      "Prince Harry has been very open about the hit he will take and why he was pressing ahead.",
      "\"The goal is accountability. It's really that simple,\" he told an audience at a New York Times event in December.",
      "News Group has, in simple terms, three lines of defence. It will firstly argue that Harry has run out of time to bring allegations of unlawful information gathering.",
      "This saw off his mobile phone hacking claim.",
      "Secondly, its lawyers will test, article-by-article, the duke's claims that the information in them came from dodgy sources.",
      "Thirdly, News Group has lined up witnesses to rebut Prince Harry and Lord Watson's broader allegation that the top brass knew what was going on and were party to the mass destruction of purportedly incriminating records in 2011.",
      "While the celebrity focus will inevitably be on the prince when he goes into the witness box, that third allegation of a cover up is the most important element of this trial.",
      "While the hit to Prince Harry's wallet will be big, the damage to NGN's reputation - and that of its executives - would be greater still if the court finds they were involved.",
      "The executives the claimants will accuse of wrongdoing include the current CEO, Rebekah Brooks. She was found not guilty of conspiracy to hack voicemails in the seismic 2014 trial that ended with the jailing of Andy Coulson, her former colleague, News of the World editor and David Cameron's communications chief.",
      "Another is Will Lewis. He played a key role in managing the hacking crisis in 2011. He is now the CEO of the Washington Post - an appointment that has been opposed by many at the newspaper because of this association.",
      "They and others deny wrongdoing.",
      "Will they be giving evidence? A spokesperson for NGN said: \"Both claimants allege unlawful destruction of emails by News International between 2010-2011. This allegation is wrong, unsustainable, and is strongly denied. NGN will be calling a number of witnesses including technologists, lawyers and senior staff to defeat the claim.\"",
      "Exactly what evidence Prince Harry brings to prove this claim - and what NGN says in defence - may define the entire battle.",
      "Tuesday really is the beginning of the end. And someone is going to lose - and lose big."

      "\"Most of the day we're just learning about each others lives and so you become really close to everyone there.\"",
      "Matt Harris, another faithful in series one, says that, while the castle is huge, \"you're not allowed out of sight from the cameras so you can't walk around the grounds\".",
      "\"They set up the rooms like the library and bar especially for the show and you're told by producers which rooms you can go into.\"",
      "How long does the roundtable really last?",
      "The lack of clocks make it hard to know exactly how long anything lasts but the roundtable surely far surpasses its 10 minutes of screen time.",
      "\"At the beginning, there are 22 people,\" says Harry. \"Even if everyone only speaks for 10 minutes, that's more than three hours.\"",
      "As viewers, it can be hard to understand why contestants are so emotional during and after the roundtable, but Harry says it's \"really intense\".",
      "\"Everyone has their own story and you're taking someone's chance of winning money away if they are banished.\"",
      "Maddy says she cried so much on the show that \"the security guards would give me ice every morning to help the puffiness of my face go down\".",
      "Where do contestants sleep?",
      "The exact location of contestants' lodgings remains a mystery to us, and apparently to the cast as well.",
      "\"It's about a 30-minute drive from the castle but you're blindfolded as you approach, so you can't see the car in front or figure out exactly where you are,\" Maddy says.",
      "She explains that the whole production team and cast stay in private lodgings but you're kept apart from everyone \"with military precision\".",
      "\"You're allowed to go for a walk but you have to be accompanied by a runner and each floor is manned by two security guards who ensure you don't leave your room unaccompanied.",
      "\"At first, I was really scared of them because I had watched the Dutch version of the show and in that, the faithful are murdered in their hotel room so every time the guard knocked on my door I thought I was going to leave the game,\" she says.",
      "Harry explains he felt lonely at times in the accommodation, especially as contestants have their phones taken away. \"But I can't complain because I slept easy every night knowing I'd be turning up for breakfast!\"",
      "What do contestants eat?",
      "Every now and then viewers get a quick glimpse of a bowl of fruit at breakfast or someone piling carrots onto their plate at dinner time.",
      "The contestants we spoke to gave the food provided on the show mixed reviews.",
      "Dr Amos says \"the breakfast was horrible, you definitely would not want to eat much of it\" but Matt was more generous and described it as \"decent\".",
      "Harry says \"there was a lot of Scottish food like haggis\" adding that as a fussy eater, he \"wouldn't touch it\".",
      "But luckily for Harry, there was the option to request food.",
      "During the day, he says he ate \"a lot of chicken nuggets and chips\" and, in the evening, he would ask for the \"perfect traitor fuel\" to be delivered to his lodgings - a crisp sandwich.",
      "What happens when contestants are banished or murdered?",
      "If a contestant is banished at the roundtable, they \"really do leave immediately\", according to Maddy.",
      "\"You're taken to do an exit interview straight away and then driven to your hotel to pack your stuff. The next day, I was escorted by security in the morning to the airport and was given my phone back.\"",
      "Maddy says the more stressful way of leaving the show is through murder.",
      "\"You turn up in the morning like you're going to breakfast and you are all waiting in these holding rooms. Eventually, you get called as if you're going to breakfast but instead, they take you to another room where the murder letter is sitting on a chair.",
      "\"It was so stressful.\"",
      "Do producers tell contestants what to say and do?",
      "\"The biggest shock was how unscripted everything is,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "Maddy says the only time producers intervened was to tell her to announce that she was an actor over breakfast.",
      "She explains she'd already shared this with her fellow contestants when they were waiting to be taken back to the hotel and had taken their mics off.",
      "Matt says there were some moments that were guided by producers.",
      "\"Occasionally, people were pulled out and told to go and speak to some other people - it's natural that they guide you into a position to make good TV.\"",
      "\"It's weird at first because there are cameras in your face but after a while, you forget they're there and producers don't ever step in,\" Harry adds.",
      "\"Most rooms also just have cameras in the corner and you have a mic attached to you so sometimes, you don't see any of the producers until the end of the day when they check in on you.\"",
      "Mike Cotton, creative director of the studio that makes The Traitors, told the BBC last year there were cameras \"dotted around every single room\".",
      "\"I'd say there's probably about 50 or 60 of those throughout the living space within the castle.\"",
      "He said a team of camera operators worked in pairs to follow the cast around into different rooms - but at a distance.",
      "At the roundtable, he said the cameras were hidden and some were built into the table itself.",
      "\"The contestants can't see any cameras and that's to keep them immersed as they can only see each other,\" he explained.",
      "What is Claudia Winkleman like?",
      "\"When I met Claudia, I was so nervous because she's so powerful,\" says Harry.",
      "\"I wanted to be a traitor so badly and I thought she'd take no notice of us but actually, she knew everything about everyone.",
      "\"She gets really involved and makes you feel really comfortable.\"",
      "How much does Claudia Winkleman know about the challenges?",
      "\"Very little,\" according to Harry.",
      "\"There's a team that create the missions and everyone else is in the dark about them. I would try off-camera to get them to tell me about it or I'd give them ideas but they wouldn't listen.\"",
      "Claudia recently said her biggest fear is accidentally giving away the traitors' identities while filming the roundtables.",
      "\"I am absolutely paranoid about ever looking at the traitors, so I sort of look just above everybody's head,\" she explained.",
      "How are traitors selected?",
      "Speaking to BBC News and other press last month, Claudia explained there's a team of people who make the decision.",
      "\"We talk to all of them, and then six of us go up to a room, the brilliant casting people, and we get through seven packets of biscuits.",
      "\"I'm the smallest voice in the room, but you decide while having had those chats who it's going to be.\"",
      "The team take the players' wishes into consideration and if someone asks not to be a traitor, they wouldn't be picked.",
      "Dr Amos says he made it very clear that he wouldn't appear on the show if he wasn't a faithful.",
      "\"I wanted to take part in the show but as a doctor I think being a traitor and lying to people has real-life consequences as my patients might not trust me.\"",
      "How do you get on The Traitors?",
      "One thing that's clear from speaking to the contestants is applying for the show is hard work.",
      "After firing off your initial written and video applications, you have a number of audiences with producers.",
      "\"They ask you to mainly tell them stories about yourself and your life,\" Dr Amos says.",
      "\"Eventually, if they like you, then you get a phone call a few weeks before [filming starts] to say you're off to Scotland,\" adds Harry.",
      "Where is The Traitors castle?",
      "The Traitors is filmed in Ardross Castle, a 19th Century building about 30 miles north of Inverness.",
      "It is set in about 100 acres of gardens and parkland and has been owned by the McTaggart family since 1983.",
      "Fun fact: its previous owner was Charles William Dyson Perrins whose grandfather, William Perrins (in partnership with John Wheeley Lea) created the recipe for Worcestershire Sauce.",
      "How many people are involved in the production?",
      "Mike Cotton said the crew on location was made up of more than 200 people.",
      "\"It sounds absolutely huge but we film one episode a day,\" he said.",
      "He explained that this team included everyone from producers and camera operators to the art department who worked their magic on interior designing the rooms.",
      "He likened the production to one you might find on set for a Hollywood film.",
      "Dr Amos says that every member of the crew knew who the traitors were.",
      "\"It looks like the faithful are in the majority on the show but in reality, you massively feel in the minority -  everyone down to the psychologist who is there to support you knows who the traitors are.\"",

    "summary": "Apple TV's hit dystopian workplace thriller finally returns after a three-year cliffhanger.",
    "story": [
      "Spoiler warning for season two's opening episode",
      "\"I don't think Mark, in the wildest reaches of his imagination, thought his company could do something as nefarious as faking a death,\" says actor Adam Scott of his character in Apple TV's Severance.",
      "But Mark's is an unusual workplace, to put it mildly.",
      "Employees at biotech conglomerate Lumon Industries are offered the company's pioneering severance programme, a concept inspired by series creator Dan Erickson's desire to escape the mind-numbing drudgery of his office jobs.",
      "Sold as the ultimate work-life balance, the firm's brain microchip procedure splits a person's consciousness and memory into dual existences.",
      "This means when \"severed\" grieving widower Mark Scout and his colleagues take the office lift each morning, their work-self - or \"innie\" - awakens for duty. Once they clock off, their \"outie\" re-emerges, returning to home life blissfully unaware.",
      "But series one's cliffhanger finale - the work of executive producer and director Ben Stiller - saw Mark discover his late wife Gemma may actually still be alive amid a rebellion by his team against their shadowy employers.",
      "The group managed to outsmart floor managers Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette) and Milchick (Tramell Tillman) and override the severance system, briefly awakening their real-world bodies. Rebellious sceptic Helly (Britt Lowery) also learned a shattering truth about her outie's company ties.",
      "Fans have been waiting almost three years to find out what happens next, and on Friday, Severance returned to Apple TV for its anticipated second season.",
      "The show got critical acclaim in 2022 to become one of Apple's breakout hits - earning 14 Emmy nominations and a Writers Guild award. It helped, too, that the show arrived at a time when the pandemic had fundamentally shifted the audience's own relationship with office life.",
      "But the Hollywood writers' strike and behind-the scenes issues (resolved for Stiller to return to produce and direct), forced the wait that left audiences hungry for answers.",
      "I ask Scott, who, fittingly, has never worked a real office job but played many office on-screen roles, how that cliffhanger has affected his latest character's psyche on the show's return.",
      "\"Mark is far more self-possessed and septical, possibly, of this company,\" says the 51-year-old, who played manager Ben Wyatt in comedy Parks and Recreation.",
      "Last season, trapped inside Lumon's brutalist architecture and sanitised walls, crunching mysterious numbers for the \"Macrodata Refinement team\", the team was fed cultish Soviet-esque propaganda about company founder Kier Eagan and his family.",
      "Where previously, \"Lumon and Kier and all of its rules and and regulations made up [the innies'] identities\", Scott says their brief escape into the outside world and the chance to taste their alternate existences has \"filled them up\".",
      "Rebel, rebel",
      "If season one darkly satirised corporate greed and rebellion, season two lays bare disingenuous corporation damage control and co-option, in ways once again sure to spark Reddit theories. Nothing is quite as it seems.",
      "Apple need the series to be popular, too, with each episode costing $20m (\u00a316m) to make according to Bloomberg - a big investment given plans to rein in spending after years of streaming services disrupting the market.",
      "In yesterday's season opener, we saw Mark's innie (newly sentient after his team's brief escape into the outside world) return to work to find his team replaced.",
      "Floor manager Milchick explains that in the five months since the uprising, fellow manager Harmony (known to workers as Ms. Cobel) has been fired, with himself promoted in her place. The team is also being promised workplace reform - including improved staff perks.",
      "After all, nothing better conveyed Lumon's unnerving forced fun than its heavily rationed waffle, melon and single-track dance parties. An HR video even reframes the team's rebellion positively, encouraging staff to \"praise Kier\" for the uprising.",
      "Mark's attempts to reunite his team are thwarted by Milchick. But newly empowered by his trip to the outside world, he decides to challenge the shadowy forces that run the company directly.",
      "This push and pull between Mark and a faceless employer may strike a chord with those being forced to go back into the office as companies clamp down on remote working post-pandemic. This month, the bank JPMorgan Chase reportedly closed comments on an intranet page announcing its return-to-work edict, following a tide of negative responses.",
      "This new series comes at a time when the balance of power is arguably shifting in favour of employers again, after a total of 100 million Americans quit their jobs in 2021 and 2022 in what Stanford economics professor Nicholas Bloom called the Great Resignation.",
      "Disillusionment has sparked cultural shifts amongst office workers. The term 'quiet quitting' has emerged, referring to doing the bare minimum in a job. Similarly \"late-stage capitalism\" has gained traction on social media, not for its Marxist roots, but to describe perceived inequalities, societal burnout and a faltering system.",
      "The board will (not) see you now",
      "In series two, we see how Lumon's disorientating, unforgiving corporate culture and its deceptive pleasantries affects those with power too. Floor managers Milchick and newly-demoted Harmony become victims as well as enforcers.",
      "Arquette, who won an Oscar for Richard Linklater's 2014 film Boyhood, says her character is \"furious\" that the corporation, in demoting her, has failed to recognise her loyalty.",
      "Tillman similarly adds that whilst it is unclear whether Milchick betrayed Harmony, he bears a \"heavy responsibility\" on his shoulders. As her replacement, he must now both placate the innies and please a board who \"do not understand what it takes to do the job\".",
      "Unlike Scott, Tillman worked in corporate office roles prior to becoming an actor and landing his breakthrough role as company man Milchick. He says he was never as \"arrogant or ambitious\" as his character, but admits to occasionally being \"adventurous\" in navigating office politics. This either worked well or, sometimes, landed him \"flat on my face\".",
      "Tillman equally recognises Milchick's isolated experience as the sole black managerial figure. Steering clear of spoilers, he says we begin to understand Milchick's experience of being \"othered by the company he serves\".",
      "\"It really speaks to how some organisations and some corporations, in their attempt to be inclusive, miss the boat,\" he adds.",
      "Arquette continues: \"I feel every few years there's a new doctrine throughout the corporate space - some kind of PR switcharoo [about] how to be current and different than we were in the past.",
      "\"I think a lot of times things do need to change, but sometimes it doesn't really feel genuine.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 06:08:12 GMT",
    "summary": "The visionary director's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin was perfected in the iconic 1990 TV series.",
    "story": [
      "David Lynch once said he was inspired to become a filmmaker when, while painting, he inexplicably heard a gust of wind and saw the artwork move on canvas.",
      "The moment defined his obsession with \"seeing paintings move\", but also his flair for the bizarre - twisting realities on the small and big screen for almost 40 years.",
      "The 78-year-old US director, who has died months after announcing an emphysema diagnosis, became the contemporary face of weird, unsettling worlds often hidden within everyday society  - from TV series Twin Peaks to films like Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire.",
      "A self-professed daydreamer, Lynch burst onto the scene via the midnight movie circuit with 1977's Eraserhead. The disorientating horror, a comment on male paranoia, set the layered template that ran through his work.",
      "Four decades later, he lived to see his style immortalised as an adjective in the Oxford dictionary. Lynchian, it reads, blurs \"surreal or sinister elements with the mundane\" - an accolade fitting of the four-time Oscar nominee turned lifetime achievement recipient, whose character was as big as his films.",
      "David Keith Lynch was born in Missoula, Montana on January 20, 1946. The son of a research scientist for the Department of Agriculture, he spent much of his early life moving around from state to state with his brother and sister.",
      "However, Lynch's parents encouraged his artistic ambitions from an early age. Speaking to Rolling Stone in 1990, he said his mother \"saved\" him by encouraging him to draw on scrap paper rather than using colouring books, where \"the whole idea is to stay between the lines\".",
      "This ethos inspired his films, tinged by a rebellious streak which he teased lasted from the age of 14 to 30. \"People rebel that long these days\", he reasoned, \"because we're built to live longer\".",
      "Youthful frustration at the calm of suburban life left him craving for \"something out of the ordinary to happen\" to challenge the superficiality of 1950s family ideals - a dark dream his films and shows brought to life.",
      "Lynch's black-and-white debut feature Eraserhead achieved this vision far more successfully than his years at art school, with its central character descending into madness after fathering a terrifying baby.",
      "Critics were left confused, but its late-night cinema success sparked a breakthrough when one audience member recommended him to Mel Brooks, who asked him to helm Elephant Man.",
      "Co-written by Lynch, the film's cast of eventual screen icons, including John Hurt as Merrick and Anthony Hopkins, transformed the story of stigma into an emotional, critical hit, outpacing the original stage play.",
      "It saw Lynch receive Oscar nominations for best director and adapted screenplay, as part of the film's eight nominations that included best picture.",
      "But if Hollywood thought it had found a new blockbuster master, Tinseltown quickly discovered Lynch had no interest in playing mainstream with his 1984 adaptation of sci-fi epic Dune.",
      "Featuring questionable special effects, costumes and rock star Sting lathered in baby oil, the Guardian's Charles Bramesco wrote that Lynch's experiments left the franchise \"radioactive for decades\". \"I'm proud of everything except Dune,\" Lynch would later tell a YouTube Q&A, while admitting elsewhere it almost \"killed\" his career.",
      "Coffee, cherry pie... and Twin Peaks",
      "The wounds began to heal, however, when he returned to double down on his signature style - placing his fascination with America's dirty underbelly in his sights.",
      "Blue Velvet, starring Kyle MacLachlan from Dune, followed a small-town boy caught up in the underworld after he discovered a severed ear. Brutal and violent in part, it divided critics but won Lynch his second Oscar nod for best director.",
      "\"This is the way America is to me,\" Lynch would later describe the movie in his book Lynch on Lynch. \"There's a very innocent, naive quality to life, and there's a horror and a sickness as well\".",
      "He won the prestigious Palme d'Or at the Cannes film festival for romance Wild at Heart in 1990, starring Nicolas Cage, Laura Dern and Willem Dafoe.",
      "But it was Lynch's belief in American beauty and horror being two sides of the same coin, perfected in his TV project Twin Peaks released the same year, that came to define him.",
      "On paper, the unsettling drama explored the murky goings-on in the US logging town following the murder of teenage beauty queen Laura Palmer, hauntingly brought to life by Sheryl Lee.",
      "But viewers were truly captivated by what it offered onscreen: a dreamlike nightmare of wonderfully idiosyncratic characters, including FBI agent Dale Cooper, again played by Kyle MacLachlan, in the apparent comfort of picket-fenced America - cherry pie and coffee included - before unflinchingly reaching into living rooms with its chilling undercurrent of sexual abuse and murder. It was one that had no prior place on US TV.",
      "The ABC show won three Golden Globe awards in 1991, including best TV drama series and best actor in a TV drama for MacLachlan.",
      "\"Without Twin Peaks, and its big-bang expansion of the possibilities of television, half your favourite shows wouldn't exist,\" wrote James Parker for The Atlantic.",
      "The show, he continued, \"effectively renegotiated TV's contract with its audience\".",
      "It mattered little that the second season faltered after the killer was revealed. TV was no longer safe, it was viscerally alive - big screen ideas and production values somehow beamed into living rooms in an age when the silver screen still ruled.",
      "In 1992, viewers were taken back to Twin Peaks with a prequel feature film, Fire Walk With Me, but nothing quite matched the original run.",
      "When the nation asked \"Who killed Laura Palmer?\", it wasn't just about solving the mystery, but finding sanctuary from rotten realities society would rather ignore.  Lynch had found his darkness.",
      "He would eventually shift focus back to the big screen to attack Hollywood's devilish tricks of fame, glamour, deceit and identity loss, in films unofficially known as his Los Angeles trilogy.",
      "This began with 1997's Lost Highway, before 2001's Mulholland Drive - perhaps the closest in aesthetic to Twin Peaks.",
      "The psychological drama received critical acclaim, scoring Lynch his third best director Oscar nomination and scooping the best director gong at Cannes. In recent years it has also been recognised for its queer themes, particularly between Naomi Watts' and Laura Harring's characters, that challenged traditional Hollywood storytelling of the time.",
      "Last came 2006's Inland Empire, Lynch's final feature film, which proved as mind-melting as ever - showing Hollywood star culture no mercy.",

    "summary": "New weight-loss drugs have broad health benefits but also come with risks, researchers warn.",
    "story": [
      "The first study to assess how weight-loss drugs affect the whole of human health has discovered an \"eye-opening\" impact on the body, researchers say.",
      "The analysis, involving about two million people, linked the drugs to better heart health, fewer infections, a lower risk of drug abuse and fewer cases of dementia.",
      "The US researchers also warned the drugs were \"not without risk\" and seemed to increase joint pain and potentially deadly inflammation in the pancreas.",
      "However, the results need very careful interpretation.",
      "Weight-loss drugs have exploded in popularity - but a full understanding of everything they touch in the body is still coming together.",
      "\"This is new territory,\" said lead researcher Dr Ziyad al-Aly, clinical epidemiologist at Washington University.",
      "Initially, they were a proven treatment for type 2 diabetes. Then, weight loss was noticed as a significant side-effect - and Ozempic and Wegovy became household names.",
      "How do weight loss drugs like Mounjaro and Wegovy work?",
      "The study used data on US veterans with type 2 diabetes, some of whom were given Ozempic or Wegovy and some more standard drugs - to measure their effect on 175 other illnesses.",
      "There appeared to be a significant boon to heart health, with lower levels of heart attacks, stroke, heart failure and high blood pressure, in those taking the new weight-loss drugs.",
      "They also cut the risk of substance abuse (including alcohol, opioids and cannabis) as well as reducing schizophrenia, suicidal thoughts and seizures.",
      "Despite the study being short, and people taking the drugs for only 3.5 years because of how new they are, it reported a 12% reduction in Alzheimer's disease.",
      "There was also less liver cancer, muscle pain and chronic kidney disease as well as a noted reduction in bacterial infections and fever.",
      "On the flip side, people were more likely to have problems in their digestive system. Feeling sick, tummy pain, inflammation in the stomach, diverticulitis (bulges in the intestines that can be painful) and haemorrhoids were more common on Ozempic or Wegovy.",
      "'Definitely eye-opening'",
      "The data, published in the journal Nature Medicine, also showed low blood pressure, including fainting, headaches, disturbed sleep, kidney stones, inflammation in the kidneys and a range of bone or joint pains, including arthritis, became more frequent.",
      "\"It was definitely eye-opening for me to see all these different hits in different organ systems,\" Dr Aly told BBC News.",
      "The explanations for the drugs' seemingly wide-ranging impact are both obvious and mysterious.",
      "Losing excess weight would in turn improve health. For example, lower levels of sleep apnoea \u2013 when breathing stops and starts while slumbering  \u2013 is thought to be down to losing weight around the tongue and throat, which can block the airways.",
      "But the drugs also appear to be directly altering the behaviour of cells and tissues in the body.",
      "Dr Aly said: \"Obesity is bad for the brain. Obesity is bad for mental health. Obesity is bad for the heart. Obesity could be the mother of all ills.\"",
      "Ozempic and Wegovy have the same active ingredient, semaglutide, in different doses, and mimic the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1.",
      "Released by the gut after eating, GLP-1 travels through the blood and sticks to little receptors on the surface of brains cells.",
      "This tells the brain there is food in the stomach and is why people feel less hungry after eating.",
      "However, receptors that respond to GLP-1 are found throughout the body, including in the heart and some parts of the immune system.",
      "\"It is very clear this class of drugs seem to suppress reward mechanisms [in the brain so it] inhibits that urge to seek out alcohol, to seek out tobacco, to seek out gambling,\" Dr Aly said.",
      "Meanwhile, lower levels of inflammation, the alarm bell of the immune system, could have a wide range of health impacts.",
      "'Ozempic babies'",
      "The range of health benefits may strengthen the case for some people using the drugs, Dr Aly said.",
      "\"When you add more benefit, for the people who really are at risk of these conditions, that's an added plus,\" he said.",
      "But for those whose weight is not affecting their health, \"maybe the risk that they're buying themselves is actually much higher than the benefit\".",
      "However, the study has drawbacks that limit its findings.",
      "Most of the veterans were white men, so it did not include any female-specific effects, such as the anecdotal phenomenon of improved fertility and unexpected \"Ozempic babies\".",
      "And there could be reasons why some had been prescribed Ozempic or Weygovy, rather than other drugs, that could provide alternative explanations for some of the findings.",
      "Protective effect",
      "Thorough clinical trials have already proven benefits to heart health - and nausea is a known side-effect - but other findings will need to go through similar rigorous testing.",
      "Alzheimer's starts more than a decade before symptoms appear - but this study suggests just a few years on semaglutide has a protective effect.",
      "Trials are already under way to work out if this effect is real.",
      "\"Such trials will lead us much closer to the truth,\" Prof Naveed Sattar, from the University of Glasgow, said.",
      "\"Fortunately\u2026 several will report out in the next one to four years.\"",
      "And while \"interesting\", he said this latest study's findings were not strong enough to influence how the drugs were prescribed.",
      "Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge, said the study needed to be interpreted \"carefully\" but provided \"useful reassurance\" about the drugs' safety in people with diabetes.",
      "And further studies in other patients were \"awaited with interest\".",
      "The \"most surprising finding\" was the increase in joint pain, since weight loss should reduce pressure on the joints.",
      "But the fact some cells in the immune system had GLP-1 receptors meant the impact of these drugs was \"somewhat unpredictable\" and while some inflammatory disorders may be eased, \"others might conceivably be exacerbated\", Prof O'Rahilly said.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 00:01:55 GMT",
    "summary": "Confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a hit. The question is why, and what can be done about it?",
    "story": [
      "Covid vaccines saved lives. Lots of them. Research by the World Health Organization (WHO) now puts the number at 475,000 in the UK with many more kept out of hospital or off a ventilator.",
      "The jabs were a \"scientific miracle\" we were told at the time, our best hope of life returning to normal after months of lockdown restrictions. But something has happened in the years since. Research suggests confidence in all types of vaccination has taken a significant hit.",
      "\"It's the great paradox of the pandemic,\" says Dr Simon Williams, a public health researcher at Swansea University.",
      "\"One of the most successful innovations in public health history, the rapid development of Covid vaccines, has actually had the effect of reducing public confidence in vaccination.\"",
      "In 2023 around 70% of UK adults said that vaccinations were safe and effective, down sharply from 90% in 2018, according to research from the Vaccine Confidence Project, run by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM).",
      "This is very much part of a worldwide trend with 52 of the 55 countries polled seeing a drop in confidence since 2019.",
      "And regular polling carried out by YouGov suggests adults are increasingly likely to say that vaccines have harmful side effects that are not being disclosed to the public. The proportion saying that statement is \"probably\" or \"definitely\" true rose to 30% in 2024 from 19% in 2019.",
      "At the same time, childhood vaccination rates have fallen further below recommended levels over the last five years, continuing a longer-term trend.",
      "\"Vaccines are always our best defence against infectious, communicable diseases,\" adds Dr Williams. \"A few percentage drops in the proportion of children covered can make a real difference.\"",
      "So why is there increased distrust in vaccination - and can anything be done to change that?",
      "The sudden 'sea change' in attitudes",
      "The long-running Covid inquiry has already looked at pandemic planning and the impact on the NHS. This week, though, it opened hearings into the vaccine rollout across the UK, from take-up of the jabs, to their safety, to the way they were marketed to the public.",
      "Dr Helen Wall, a GP from Bolton, saw the shift in vaccines attitudes over the pandemic first-hand.",
      "In May 2021 the town became the centre of national attention; Covid infections  more than quadrupled in three weeks driven by the new Delta variant. A huge vaccine drive was ordered with army medics staffing mobile units. Dr Wall led the rollout, as clinical director of the local NHS commissioning board.",
      "\"People were coming out and making tea and coffee for people in the line,\" she says. \"There was this real feeling of camaraderie.\"",
      "But around the middle of 2021, she noticed a sudden \"sea change\" in attitudes.",
      "\"Patients would start to say to me, 'why should I trust you, you work for them, you're being paid by them, you're part of the government'.",
      "\"We very quickly went from being lifesavers to just another part of the system that no-one trusted in some spheres.\"",
      "Before long, protestors appeared outside local clinics with placards trying to convince people not get jabbed, and Dr Wall says that she received death threats.",
      "Nearly four years on, she reflects: \"I think what Covid has done is amplified a confidence issue that was already there and ramped up some of the doubts and question-marks for people.\"",
      "From smallpox to MMR",
      "But vaccine hesitancy certainly did not start with the pandemic. The current wave of scepticism is the latest rekindling of an angry debate going back to the dawn of vaccination in 1796 when Edward Jenner created the smallpox vaccine.",
      "In the 1890s huge crowds protested in Leicester against mandatory smallpox vaccinations. Then in the 1970s the diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough jab was linked to brain injury in children, before later being found safe.",
      "In 1998 British doctor Andrew Wakefield published his now infamous research paper falsely claiming the combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was responsible for rising rates of autism in children.",
      "Wakefield's research, described as the most damaging scientific fraud of all time, has since been thoroughly discredited and he was struck off the doctors' register.",
      "But the damage was done. The number of measles cases in England and Wales jumped to 2,032 in 2012 from just 56 in 1998. It took more than a decade for MMR uptake to return to anything like normal and that debunked link with autism still gets repeated today.",
      "It was the first serious medical scandal of the internet era and also a sign of things to come.",
      "Internet age and misinformation",
      "Since the birth of social media in the early 2000s, with sites like Friendster and MySpace, there have been growing concerns about the spread of health rumours and misinformation.",
      "Research from the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) found 20% of parents surveyed in 2023 said they had come across information online that made them worried about vaccines, a sharp jump from just 6% the year before.",
      "As social media sites have gone from niche start-ups to established parts of the media landscape, so the risk of misinformation has changed.",
      "\"Now somebody in one corner of the world can post something and suddenly millions of people in another part of the world can see it within seconds,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"It's not just the speed but the reach of misinformation which puts us in completely uncharted territory.\"",
      "Where young people stand",
      "Research has consistently shown that younger adults are the group most likely to use social media to make decisions about their personal health, and the most vulnerable to misinformation.",
      "Lockdowns and other restrictions also meant many of those in their late teens and twenties lost out on education, on early job opportunities and on full social lives in the pandemic. At the same time they were far less likely than older groups to fall seriously ill after catching the virus.",
      "\"They were the ones who felt like they paid the price for what was primarily an older person's problem,\" says Prof Heidi Larson, a former head of global immunisation communication at UNICEF and the director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at LSHTM.",
      "The data suggests younger groups have also seen the biggest falls in vaccine confidence over the last four years, something she says is the \"most concerning\" part of her research.",
      "The proportion of 18-24-year-olds, for example, who say that vaccines are safe and effective has fallen to under 60% in 2023 from 80% in 2019.",
      "\"They should really be the priority, because these are potential young parents and if they are questioning the importance of vaccines, then we are in trouble,\" says Prof Larson, who is giving expert evidence to the Covid inquiry this week.",
      "\"We have to recognise that this is about the whole experience of Covid, and all the controls and pressures. It's like, 'Enough of being told what to do, I just don't want your vaccines anymore'.\"",
      "Speed and safety concerns",
      "The speed at which new Covid vaccines had to be developed has also been at the centre of some of the rumour, concern and distrust there is online.",
      "The data now shows the jabs did their main job \u2013 helping our bodies clear the virus and cutting the risk of severe disease, hospitalisation and death.",
      "In early clinical trials though the vaccines were also said to be effective \u2013 90% so in the case of the Pfizer jab \u2013 at preventing Covid in the first place. In real world use, that protection against infection and transmission faded within months, as immunity \"waned \" and the virus mutated into different variants.",
      "Crucially though protection against severe disease has proved far more long-lasting.",
      "Then there were safety concerns.",
      "The AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were linked to a rare, but serious, blood clot in the brain and their use was restricted to certain groups.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna jabs, meanwhile, have been linked to rare cases of heart inflammation, which usually clear up without long-term damage.",
      "The reality is every vaccine, like any medical treatment, always carries a small level of risk, some more than others.",
      "\"The science and public health perspective is quite clear: not only were Covid vaccines safe and effective, but we would have been in a very different world if they hadn't been rolled out so quickly,\" says Dr Williams at Swansea University.",
      "\"[But] we're in this complicated, murky world with public attitudes where some people thought they weren't what was promised.\"",
      "Vaccine fatigue and 'complacency'",
      "Many people in the UK no longer have direct experience of how dangerous viruses such as measles can be.",
      "The UKHSA says it's been seriously concerned for some time about falling childhood vaccination rates.",
      "The organisation's director of public health programmes, Dr Mary Ramsay, believes that trend, which started in the decade before Covid, is more likely to be driven by complacency than a drop in confidence in the childhood vaccination programme.",
      "Modern lives are also busy and finding time to take a child to a GP for a series of jabs is not always straightforward, she suggests.",
      "In 2024 the number of children receiving a first dose of the MMR vaccine fell to 88.9% in England, the lowest level for 14 years and over the last year we've seen significant measles outbreaks in London, Birmingham and Bristol.",
      "A high level of measles vaccination is vital as it prevents transmission of the virus and protects not just those who receive the jab, but those who can't \u2013 young babies and children with weakened immune systems, for example.",
      "Dr Wall, now clinical director of population health in Greater Manchester, also thinks there might be an element of \"vaccine fatigue\" creeping in since the pandemic, with even some NHS staff left \"tired, jaded and fed-up\" after years of vaccines, boosters, rules and restrictions.",

      "In late 2021, the government brought in a policy of mandatory Covid vaccines for care home staff in England, and later tried to extend that to NHS workers.

    "story": [
      "The Conservatives have called for the forthcoming public inquiry into the Southport murders to consider why the police, prosecutors and government did not make public more details about the killer last summer before his trial.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer have both said the government could not have risked Axel Radukabana walking free by ignoring advice that publishing information could have jeopardised his trial.",
      "But Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said it was likely an \"information vacuum\" had resulted in misinformation which \"fuelled\" the riots which followed the Southport attack.",
      "He asked why the discovery of ricin and a copy of an al-Qaeda training manual in Radukabana's house could not have been swiftly revealed.",
      "Cooper said the government had wanted to make public that Radukabana had been referred to the counter-extremism programme Prevent, but could not because of legal advice.",
      "Rudakubana was charged with three counts of murder and 10 of attempted murder on 31 July, shortly after launching his attack which killed Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and Alice da Silva Aguiar, nine.",
      "Within days, in early August, officers searching Rudakubana's home found ricin and a file entitled \"Military Studies in the Jihad against the Tyrants, the Al Qaeda training manual\".",
      "The government was kept up-to-date about the discovery. The BBC has been told the ricin was in a Tupperware box in his bedroom.",
      "Police rarely give details of an ongoing investigation without what they describe as a \"policing purpose\".",
      "In this case, false rumours were spreading online about the killer, including that he had migrated to Britain.",
      "Senior officers felt under pressure to reassure the public, and dispel some of the rumours about the suspect by making clear he was in fact British.",
      "But after discovering the ricin and manual they did not immediately make this public.",
      "The investigation continued, with searches taking weeks because of the need for teams to wear hazmat suits and take a break every 40 minutes.",
      "As they prepared to announce the outcome to the investigation, senior police officers became frustrated that the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was advising them to withhold many details they felt should be made public, due to false claims online.",

      "Sources close to the handling of the case say police wanted to announce these charges and reveal the discovery of the ricin and manual 11 days earlier, on 18 October, but there was a hold-up as the CPS and the police negotiated over what could be said publicly.",
      "A source said the CPS \"put a load of red pen through the statement\".",
      "Rudakubana was finally charged with the additional two offences on 29 October.",
      "It was at this point, three months after the Southport attacks, that police made public for the first time that the ricin and manual had been found.",
      "He was not charged with preparing for acts of terrorism, because under current laws this would involve finding evidence of a political motivation or ideology, and none had been found.",
      "The prime minister suggested on Tuesday the laws defining terrorism might need to change to take account of lone attackers without a clear motivation.",
      "Rudakubana has now pleaded guilty to all the charges he faced and will be sentenced on Thursday.",
      "Normally the risk of jeopardising the case falls away once all charges have been decided, either by a plea, or a jury reaching a verdict.",
      "Crime reporters attended a police and CPS-led briefing setting out the entire case - but on Monday, the CPS again decided the information should not be published, this time until after the sentencing.",

      "Nick Price, CPS director of legal services, said: \"The next stage of the process is for the prosecution to present our full case to the court on Thursday - including relevant details of the defendant's past - so the judge can consider all the evidence when passing sentence.",
      "\"This will be the point when the full details of this case will be heard by the public.",
      "\"We recognise the profound interest in these proceedings, and it is important the prosecution case is presented to the court so the facts can be determined which may inform the sentence handed down.\"",
      "The CPS has taken this position because it believes the judge is entitled to make factual findings about the case and must also determine what weight to attach to different aspects of the evidence.",
      "However, the Crime Reporters Association, representing around 50 senior crime and home affairs correspondents, has written to the CPS raising concerns that the service is breaching a long-established principle that there is no legal risk in publishing material about a case after guilty pleas and before sentencing.",
      "The CPS said in its response that the \"independence of the judge must be respected\"."

      "As well as being referred to Prevent three times between 2019-2021, Rudakubana was excluded from school aged 13 in October 2019, after which he returned to the school in December that year with a hockey stick and assaulted a pupil, breaking their wrist.",

      "Sir Keir's decision to deliver a speech after Rudakubana's guilty pleas was not only a recognition of the \"barbaric\" attack but also the failures of the state in its handling of the teenager over the years, and the intensity of the reaction to the murders.",

      "Hasina's regime ruled over the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971 in which hundreds were killed, including at least 90 people while she clung to power on her last day in office.",
      "Controversial in her own right, Hasina is also the aunt of Labour MP Tulip Siddiq - who resigned as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's anti-corruption minister last week after a slew of corruption allegations that she denied.",
      "These included claims Siddiq's family embezzled up to \u00a33.9bn from infrastructure spending in Bangladesh - and that she used properties in London linked to her aunt's allies.",
      "The government's ethics watchdog later found she did not break the ministerial code, but Siddiq resigned anyway.",
      "That isn't necessarily the end of the matter, though.",
      "Questions for Starmer",
      "The episode raises troubling questions about Starmer's judgement and Labour's approach to courting the votes of people of Bangladeshi heritage.",
      "Questions are now swirling over why Labour failed to see this coming, given the party has long known about Siddiq's links to her scandal-hit aunt. It was 2016 when Bin Quasem's case was first raised with her.",
      "He and others among Bangladesh's \"disappeared\" have represented an awkward tension with Siddiq's publicly voiced views on human rights in the years since.",
      "She long campaigned for the release from Iran of her constituent Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, for example, while showing an apparent comparative indifference in her public statements to the suffering and extrajudicial killings under her aunt's regime in Bangladesh.",
      "Siddiq has also previously appeared alongside her aunt at a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and appeared on BBC television as a spokesperson for the Awami League, the political party Hasina has led since 1981.",
      "Siddiq also thanked Awami League members for helping her election as a Labour MP in 2015. Two pages on her website from 2008 and 2009 setting out her links to the party were later removed.",
      "Yet once in Parliament Siddiq told journalists that she had \"no capability or desire to influence politics in Bangladesh\".",
      "So these links weren't a secret, but perhaps they weren't viewed as a bad thing within Labour, not least since it has shown little sign of distancing itself from the Awami League in recent years.",
      "Then-Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick told the Commons in 2012 that they were \"sister organisations\", a warmth shared by many of his colleagues.",
      "And Starmer - who entered Parliament in 2015 at the same time as Siddiq in her neighbouring seat - has met Hasina multiple times.",
      "This included in 2022 when the then-Bangladeshi PM was in London for Queen Elizabeth II's funeral, a meeting that Bin Quasem calls \"heartbreaking and shocking\".",
      "A Starmer ally argues it is \"perfectly legitimate\" for him to have met Hasina, and it did not amount to an endorsement of her policies.",
      "The apparent attempts by Labour over the years to keep Bangladesh on side might reflect the political reality here in the UK, especially in parts of the capital city.",
      "\"You can't succeed in east London without understanding the Bangladeshi vote\", one seasoned Labour campaigner explains.",
      "However, those who fail to appreciate the country's divided and volatile politics can end up offending those they are attempting to charm. \"You need to carefully balance what you say and do,\" the campaigner says. \"If you are too overt for one [Bangladeshi] party, you'll get criticised.\"",
      "Analysis by the FT suggests there are at least 17 UK constituencies where the voting-age Bangladeshi population is larger than the Labour majority.",
      "Starmer's Holborn and St Pancras constituency has at least 6,000 adult residents of Bangladeshi origin.",
      "A potential blind spot",
      "Might this mix of warmth and political pragmatism have clouded Starmer's judgement from a potential corruption storm on the horizon when, shortly after winning the election in July, he appointed Siddiq as the Treasury minister responsible for leading Britain's anti-corruption efforts?",
      "\"Starmer has blindspots for his friends and political allies,\" says a Labour source. \"It's not new.\"",
      "Investigative journalist David Bergman, who has been shedding light on Siddiq's connections to Bangladeshi politics for a decade, points out context is everything. \"This was not a major story until Labour got into power, Tulip Siddiq became a minister and the Awami League government fell,\" he says.",
      "'The howls were terrifying': Imprisoned in the notorious 'House of Mirrors'",
      "How Bangladesh's protests ended  Sheikh Hasina's 15-year reign",
      "He argues someone in the party should have raised concerns many years before. \"There was first a blind spot about Tulip Siddiq's failure to respond to enforced disappearances in Bangladesh,\" Bergman argues.",
      "\"Then there was a blind spot about how tied she was to the UK Awami League.\"",
      "When I put this to one Labour MP, they responded that the UK media, as well as Labour, have had a Bangladesh blind spot.",
      "\"There are some 600,000 people in the British Bangla diaspora\", they say. \"It is a country with the eighth largest population on Earth yet we've not heard a peep [from the UK media] since the events of 5 August.\"",
      "The corruption investigations into Hasina are likely to rumble on for some time, potentially bringing further issues for Starmer's top team to address in the months ahead while Siddiq remains a Labour MP.",
      "For Bin Quasem, the toppling of Hasina's regime saw him abruptly awoken in his cell, bundled into a car and dumped in a ditch, before finally being allowed to return home to his two daughters.",
      "Toddlers when he last saw them in 2016, they are now young women. \"I couldn't really recognise them, and they couldn't recognise me,\" he tells me through tears.",

      "The UK has banned European vessels from catching the silvery fish species in its North Sea waters to protect marine wildlife that depend on it for food.",
      "But the EU is challenging the move, arguing it discriminates against Danish vessels that fish sandeel commercially, breaching the post-Brexit trade deal.",
      "The dispute is now heading for a three-day trade tribunal hearing, after formal talks to resolve the wrangle failed.",

      "They could uphold the UK's position - or order the UK to change or drop its ban, in which case Brussels could ultimately retaliate with tariffs on British exports if ministers refused to comply.",
      "Under the trade deal, a final ruling must be delivered by the end of April, although it could be issued earlier. There is no right to appeal.",
      "It comes as the UK prepares for tricky negotiations with the EU over new catch limits from June next year, when current arrangements under the trade deal run out.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer is also hoping to persuade EU leaders to strike new deals in areas such as security and food trade, as part of a wider \"reset\" in relations with the UK.",
      "Environmental plaudits",
      "Sandeel, a group of small eel-like fish species, is a jointly managed fish stock under the trade deal. It is not caught for culinary reasons and is unlikely to be found on restaurant menus in European capitals.",
      "But it is a favourite food of other fish species like cod and haddock, as well as threatened seabirds such as puffins and kittiwakes.",
      "The UK has effectively stopped its own vessels from fishing the species since 2021 through its licensing regime, on the grounds it is required to prevent overfishing and protect the North Sea ecosystem.",
      "Rishi Sunak's Conservative government then banned all vessels from catching the species in English waters of the sea in March last year, with a similar ban in Scottish waters brought in by ministers in the SNP-led Scottish government.",
      "It won the UK plaudits from conservation groups, which had long campaigned for an outright ban, and Sir Keir's Labour government has kept the ban in place since taking power in July.",
      "But it has outraged Danish fishermen, who sell sandeel to animal feed and fish oil producers and under the post-Brexit trade deal hold the right to fish the overwhelming majority of the EU's share of the species in UK waters.",
      "Small fish, big row",
      "The dispute centres on whether the UK's right to restrict trawlers for conservation reasons unnecessarily restricts agreed EU fishing rights.",
      "In its submissions to the court, the EU has argued the geographical scope of the ban is not justified by the scientific modelling on stock levels, or the \"economic and social impacts\" on Danish fishing communities.",
      "In a response published by the court, the UK has defended the scientific advice behind the ban, adding that the EU has failed to point out \"any superior model\" available at the time.",
      "It added that the UK was within its rights to bring in the ban, highlighting that the trade agreement itself commits both sides to taking account of the impact of fishing on marine diversity.",
      "The UK decision to continue the ban has been backed by an unlikely coalition stretching across three political parties, conservation groups and committed Brexiteers.",
      "The renewable energy industry has also taken an interest, arguing the ban helps achieve the necessary level of seabird \"resilience\" to allow more wind farms to be built whilst still hitting conservation targets.",
      "The UK has previously estimated sandeel caught in its waters is worth around \u00a345m a year, a tiny industry in the context of the wider trade relationship.",
      "But the dispute will be watched closely for how the judges balance the UK's right to take conservation measures with economic rights.",

      "Published21 January 2025",
      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy says some opposition members of the House of Lords are \"intent on wrecking\" the Football Governance Bill by having it delayed \"for years to come\".",
      "The legislation, which will establish the first independent regulator for the professional men's game in England, was reintroduced to Parliament by the government in October.",
      "It has just completed the first 'committee stage' in the Lords, where hundreds of potential amendments have been tabled.",
      "One that could soon be voted on is a proposal to reclassify the legislation as a 'hybrid bill', which would require additional consultation with clubs.",
      "\"We really are at a critical juncture here,\" said Nandy, speaking at an event organised by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Football and the English Football League (EFL).",
      "\"We've had what is known as a 'wrecking amendment' put in front of the House of Lords in recent weeks to turn this bill into a hybrid bill, which would bury it in committee for years and years to come.",
      "\"And I do want to say to that handful of peers that have decided to take that approach, 'what you are doing is killing off the hopes and dreams and inheritance of fans who deserve far, far better'.\"",
      "A hybrid bill is one that is deemed to target specific private interests - such as football clubs. It must allow those affected to submit a petition to Parliament outlining their opposition, potentially adding to the time needed for it to pass into legislation. The hybrid amendment has been put forward by Tory frontbench peer Lord Parkinson of Whitley Bay.",

      "Background to Football Governance Bill",
      "The landmark legislation was tabled initially in March by the previous Conservative government, but failed to pass through Parliament before the general election was called in May.",
      "The reintroduced version will give the regulator powers to assess the impact of the Premier League's controversial 'parachute payments' to relegated clubs as part of a 'State of the Game' review every five years.",
      "Its findings could influence which proposed sharing model the regulator may then impose - the Premier League's or the EFL's - if it is asked to decide how much money the top flight should redistribute to the football pyramid via 'backstop powers'.",
      "It will also \"explicitly require clubs to provide effective engagement\" with fans on changes to ticket prices and any proposals to relocate home grounds.",
      "However, while supporter groups and the EFL are among those to have welcomed the bill, the Premier League is concerned at the regulator having \"unprecedented and untested powers to intervene in the distribution of [its] revenues\", and also said it could have \"a negative impact\" on competitiveness and investment.",
      "The legislation has also faced opposition from peers such as West Ham United vice chair Baroness Brady, who told the Lords that there are \"dangers lurking in this bill\".",
      "Other members of the Lords have expressed concerns over the potential cost to smaller clubs, although the government said there was no intention to \"impose unnecessary, onerous and burdensome requirements\" on clubs, which was \"in no-one's interest\".",
      "'Hard but important message'",
      "Last month Nandy told MPs it was \"high time we got on with it\" when asked about the scrutiny the legislation had faced in the House of Lords. She has now delivered what she called \"a hard but important message\".",
      "\"It was a Labour opposition and the Conservative government that put the commitment to continue with these reforms into our manifestos, and it was the British people who voted for them,\" she said.",
      "\"And my message to those handful of Conservative peers is: 'We will not rest until we make good on that promise to fans'.",
      "\"This is what people voted for - this is nothing less than fans deserve, and we are a government that will leave no stone unturned to deliver on that promise. Change for fans has been long overdue, that change is coming, and nobody will stand in its way.\"",
      "The bill will now pass to the 'report stage' of its journey through the House of Lords, where some of the proposed amendments will be voted on, before it passes to the Commons. The government hopes it will come into law later this year.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump will want to do a good deal with the UK, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones has insisted.",
      "Jones, the chancellor's second-in-command, said he was confident UK-US trading relationships could be deepened and that Peter Mandelson will be \"brilliant\" as the new UK ambassador to the US.",
      "However, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has claimed Prime Minster Sir Keir Starmer is in a \"weak\" negotiating position due to his wish to strengthen ties with the EU at the same time as with the US.",
      "The PM has insisted he can walk a tightrope and balance strong trading and security relationships on both sides, despite Trump's dislike of the EU.",
      "But some nervousness seems apparent, with Lord Mandelson, launching a charm offensive ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, lauding his \"straight talking and deal-making instincts\" and talking up a new \"Atlantic alliance\".",

      "\"Donald Trump is well-known for wanting to do a good deal - I think there are plenty of good deals for us to do together,\" he said.",
      "\"There are definitely opportunities to deepen our trading relationships, not least in technology, science and research... and I think that's something that could be a positive outcome.\"",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, the Treasury minister suggested the UK could dodge Trump's pledge for a 20% tax on all imports into the US due to not being in a \"trade deficit\", adding ministers have \"prepared for all scenarios\".",
      "Jones also expressed confidence Lord Mandelson will \"form a very strong partnership with the new administration\", despite some reports that the incoming president may reject him - and a top Trump adviser dismissing him as an \"absolute moron\".",
      "The appointment of Lord Mandelson, who is best-known as a New Labour spin doctor and minister under Tony Blair, is the first time in 50 years that a PM has selected a politician rather than a diplomat for the role, which Jones said was \"because we want to do things differently\".",
      "Asked about the Labour Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, warning of \"resurgent fascism\" ahead of Trump's inauguration, Jones strongly disagreed, insisting the UK government respected Trump's democratic mandate, adding: \"I speak on behalf of the government and we don't agree with it\".",
      "A much less rosy view of the \"special relationship\" was painted by Farage, a long-time supporter of Trump, whose offer of acting as a go-between in negotiations with the president-elect has so far been rejected by the government.",
      "Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The Westminster Hour, the Reform UK leader said the government needs to \"think outside the box\" when dealing with the Trump administration, and that all evidence - including Lord Mandelson's appointment - suggests they are not doing that.",
      "\"I think what this government does, is what all governments do - they stick with the established, status quo methods of appointing people,\" he said.",
      "Farage said he feared the UK would squander \"an amazing opportunity\" to get away from tariffs and negotiate free trade deals due to the prime minister's refusal to choose the US over the EU.",
      "\"This guy [Trump] does business differently to anybody else we've seen in global politics before,\" he said. \"They don't think they need me - but they might find in short order that maybe they do.",
      "\"If we have a deteriorating relationship with America that does hurt us financially, it'll be the Labour government's fault,\" adding that Trump is \"probably more Eurosceptic\" than he is.",
      "'Blind faith'",
      "The fact the UK still does not have a free trade deal with the US, despite this being a priority in Boris Johnson's Conservative manifesto in 2019, has been criticised by the party's current leader Kemi Badenoch, who said leaving the EU without a growth plan was  \"a mistake\".",
      "Shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, a prominent voice in the Vote Leave Brexit campaign, was questioned about Badenoch's comments by Kuenssberg after she urged swift action to agree a UK-US trade deal.",
      "Patel, who was Johnson's home secretary, said there had been plans to legislate around starting the Brexit process - but she acknowledged a lack of plans for what to do afterwards to rebuild economic relationships.",
      "She said: \"In terms of long-term sustainable proposals Kemi's right to recognise that clearly wider plans needed to be put in place.\"",
      "Responding to Patel, the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson Calum Miller claimed the Conservatives were now competing with Reform UK to be \"the most submissive with Trump\" - but the UK should not put \"blind faith\" in the new administration.",
      "He said: \"[Priti Patel's] desire to rush into a free trade deal between the UK and US - one that could sell British farmers and food standards down the river - reminds us of where her and her party's true alliances lie: with the Mar-a-Lago clan, not with constituents here in Britain.\""

    "story": [
      "\"Everybody's nervous \u2013 because they simply don't know what he is going to do.\"",
      "That is the basic truth about Trump for governments, business bosses, military chiefs, and maybe you feel it too as he gets ready to make his incredible political comeback official.",
      "He will take the Oath of Office for the second time on Monday, becoming the most powerful man in the Western world and in charge of the UK's biggest trading partner. Soon after, he can sign executive orders that might affect how the UK makes a living or defends itself.",
      "The range of risks is enormous. The opportunities are too.",
      "Trump and his team are different this time round, more prepared, with a more aggressive agenda perhaps, but his delight in keeping the world guessing seems undimmed. It's this uncertainty accompanying Trump that Whitehall and Westminster find so shocking.",
      "How can the UK prepare for what it can't yet know?",
      "Stay out of the circus",
      "A small group of senior ministers has been trying.",
      "There have been series of secret \"mini-cabinet\" meetings, with the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Chancellor Rachel Reeves, the Foreign Secretary David Lammy, and the Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds \"trying to plan for what might come\", according to one source.",
      "One insider tells me there hasn't been too much preparation for multiple specific scenarios because \"you'd drive yourself crazy\" trying to guess Trump's next steps. But another source says various papers have been prepared to be presented to the wider Cabinet.",
      "I'm told the focus has been \"looking for opportunities\" rather than panicking about whether Trump might follow through on some of his more outlandish statements, such as annexing Canada.",
      "The PM's picked one of Labour's wiliest operators as his voice in DC, Lord Mandelson, who on Friday chose to write a piece for Fox News, Trump's favourite news outlet. He was incredibly rude about Trump in the not-so-distant past but now heaps praise on him \u2013 and he's not the only Labour figure to change his tune.",
      "(As we revealed in our newsletter on Thursday, sadly for Jock and Poppy, Mandelson's border collie and schnauzer, the Foreign Office travel budget won't stretch for them to travel to DC in canine style on the Queen Mary 2 ocean liner.)",
      "The government might not have been in power during Trump's last term, but in Westminster, and in the City, there's a universal memory of his late-night social media posts causing frenzies.",
      "There is a determination this time round to stay out of the circus.",
      "One senior figure says diplomatically: \"We will be calm and nimble.\"",
      "With less politesse, another source who's dealt with Trump said: \"Trump is going to say things that make Labour MPs mad \u2013 don't brief that the PM is personally upset. Put your big nappy on and ignore it.\"",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "Keeping us safe - and anxiety about 'nightmare scenario'",
      "The hallmark of the relationship with our \"chief ally\", as described by a senior government source, is helping keep each other safe. At a time of unique instability around the world, the number of unknowns are deeply uncomfortable for Westminster and other allied capitals.",
      "There is no question the intelligence and security relationship is incredibly close and was maintained during Trump's first term \u2013 despite some pretty big surprises at the UK end.",
      "One source remembers that \"the biggest jaw dropper was after the Salisbury attacks\", when two Russian agents used the nerve agent Novichok on the streets of the UK. President Trump was at Chequers with then-PM Theresa May and her team, and seemed reluctant to take the attack as seriously as the UK was demanding.",
      "One of those present explains: \"We were arguing about how bad and destabilising that was \u2013 he asked why. We said a state with nuclear weapons had used this on the soil of another state with nukes, and he said, 'I didn't know the UK had nuclear weapons'.\"",
      "But during that first term, despite Trump's seeming threats to NATO, his bellicose rhetoric did push more European states to cough up extra cash for defence. The Abraham Accords were signed, though those agreements did not, as Trump boasted at the time, achieve a lasting peace in the Middle East. But they did mark progress.",
      "Has Trump promised too much on US economy?",
      "Bowen: Israel has changed since Donald Trump's last term \u2013 has he?",
      "Decoding Donald Trump's new official portrait",
      "There is, though, inside government, genuine anxiety about what's described as the \"nightmare scenario\".",
      "If the US cuts support for Ukraine, emboldening Russia, Europe might not agree about how \u2013 or if \u2013 to fight. That could leave Nato, the western defence alliance, split and fundamentally weakened. Sources question, however, whether this would really serve Trump's interests. After all he needs allies and a united West to combat China, America's biggest rival.",
      "While grappling with the unpredictability \u2013 Trump's wild half-threats of making Canada the 51st State or grabbing Greenland \u2013 sources inside government also spot opportunities. One senior figure says: \"In Ukraine and the Middle East there are options opening up. We need to partner so as to influence what the US does in these foreign policy priorities.\"",
      "This week, I interviewed the former secretary general of Nato, Jens Stoltenberg, who echoed that sentiment.",
      "He told me: \"[Trump] has language and a way of expressing himself which sometimes creates uncertainty, creates some noise, and I think that our main task \u2013 friends and allies \u2013 is then to find ways to deal with that uncertainty in a way that minimizes the risks to all of us.\"",
      "Sources point to a weaker Iran, progress towards the ceasefire between Gaza and Israel, and a growing sense that both sides want to bring the Ukraine conflict to an end. Trump's bravado about ending the war in a day has already softened to a three-to-six-month ambition and \"there's no sign of a rush to abandonment now\", says one insider.",
      "But there is a sense in Kyiv and Whitehall that a negotiation is coming. The UK's hope is to help shape America's approach rather than panic about the US upping sticks.",
      "Stoltenberg is also urging Trump to continue the supply of weapons to Ukraine so as to strengthen its position in any future negotiation with Putin.",
      "\"The paradox is that weapons to Ukraine is the path to peace in Ukraine,\" he added.",
      "And while the government is miles away from accepting anything like Trump's demand to increase defence spending to 5%, there is a private acknowledgement at senior levels in Whitehall that his demand for Europe to spend more of its own money on defence in Europe is not entirely illogical \u2013 and it's helpful to those making the case for more cash on defence here.",
      "Economic nerves",
      "While some hedge fund traders might cash in from the kind of volatility Trump might create, there are plenty of nerves in other parts of the economy.",
      "That's partly down to his tendency to sound off. A City source says: \"You're always heart in mouth, waiting for the next wacky idea, or for him to say something crazy that is going to impact your business, a $10bn deal that's on the slate, and you are three quarters of the way there \u2013 suddenly he'll say something that can make it fall to bits overnight.\"",
      "And it's not just his late-night online posts causing worry. One of his sells to the American public was to help those trading at home by putting taxes on imports, or tariffs, making it much more expensive for other countries to sell into the States.",
      "But as the IMF warned yesterday, slapping extra tariffs on other countries could hit them hard, and impact the rest of the world's earning power.",
      "In Cabinet there's awareness of how big a departure it would be if Trump goes as far as he has suggested. One minister told me: \"It's a huge moment of history \u2013 American pledging a different way of doing business to what's essentially been in place since the second world war.\"",
      "China and the EU, the other two big trading blocs, would be likely to answer back which could lead to \"huge ramifications of a global trade war\", the minister acknowledges.",
      "Another senior figure warns the UK might struggle to be relevant in a bust up on that scale, saying there'll be an \"arm wrestle between the three \u2013 they won't pay the UK or our interests very much attention\".",
      "As Trump, with the help of Elon Musk, looks to roll back regulation and cut tax, a City insider suggests the UK could fall out of favour because Trump's ambition is to build a very different economy to ours, and that could create a tension of its own.",
      "But another City insider points out that the stock market is \"one of the metrics he cares most about\", and that it is driven by the big tech companies, many of whom depend on selling into China. \"The love affair with the tech bros mean he's not going to want to undermine too much of that,\" they said.",
      "Leader to leader",
      "Whether it's on the economy or Ukraine or any other issue, the relationship between president and prime minister will be absolutely crucial.",
      "Starmer and Trump could hardly be more different. A lawyerly leader known as \"Mr Rules\" versus a man who is a convicted felon and has made a career out of behaving as if rules don't apply to him.",
      "A No 10 source says forget all the noise, and points to the two men meeting in autumn and holding three phone calls since. \"It is the direct conversations that really matter \u2013 whatever Trump's personal style it's clear the substance is there,\" they say, adding that the PM's calm temperament helps.",
      "But others who've dealt with Trump in government, and been on calls with Trump and previous prime ministers, warn how difficult it can be. \"On a good day, fantastic, on a bad day, you'd be crouching,\" one source said.",
      "Another former official who was part of meetings with Trump and Boris Johnson said \"they were like two silverbacks wrestling\", making staff listening in next door cry with laughter. Johnson would \"flatter him obsequiously\" to get what he wanted.",
      "The official was also on calls between Trump and May. These were totally different, with \"more than a whiff of misogyny, he would shout over her\" and talk about the Queen or invite her to play golf, rather than discuss tricky subjects May wanted to raise.",
      "They believe handling Trump will be Sir Keir's biggest challenge: \"We sent him a vicar's daughter, then a pirate who knew how to handle him, now a human rights lawyer,\" they say, adding \"it's not going to work in a world increasingly like the time of 1930s strong men\".",
      "Whatever happens behind closed doors, as America's closest ally, defending Trump's decisions could be incredibly uncomfortable for the prime minister.",
      "A former No 10 official says: \"If Trump says there'll have to be partition in Ukraine, Boris will say awful, others in Labour will say awful, but if Starmer won't sell it in Europe, Trump will take offence and he will punish him.\"",
      "Starmer's allies are more sanguine that \"the politics don't have to match for the relationship to be a success\".",
      "And a success is what they must hope for. It is no secret Labour would have preferred the Democrats and some staff even went to bang on doors for Kamala Harris.",
      "The question for government is how to influence Trump to get what the UK wants, and how to keep its head when the inevitable dramas arrive.",
      "A foreign policy insider told me: \"It might come at a price, but it is in our interest for him to be a success, not be cantankerous.\"",
      "The incoming president is perhaps both an emblem and a product of the changed and uncertain times we live in. As one minister says, \"it's all gone in Trump's direction\".",
      "It is impossible to be sure what Donald Trump, mark two, will do. But after his incredible comeback, and months of nerves on both sides of the Atlantic, we don't have long to wait.",

      "Sir Keir's visit comes just over a week before the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz-Birkenau, which was the largest Nazi concentration camp.",
      "Six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis and their accomplices during World War Two.",
      "The prime minister recalled feeling \"a sickness\" and \"air of desolation\" as he tried to make sense of \"the enormity of this barbarous, planned, industrialised murder\".",
      "The visit, Sir Keir said, showed \"more clearly than ever before\" that the Holocaust \"took a collective endeavour by thousands of ordinary people who each played their part in constructing this whole industry of death\".",
      "He was joined by his wife Lady Victoria Starmer, who is Jewish and had visited Auschwitz once before.",
      "She was equally moved, the prime minister said, adding: \"It was her second visit, but no less harrowing than the first time she stepped through that gate and witnessed the depravity of what happened here.\"",
      "While in Poland, Sir Keir and Tusk discussed defence, energy security, climate and illegal migration in Europe, the prime minister told a news conference.",
      "Speaking about cooperation between the UK and the EU, Tusk said he hoped for a \"Breturn\", adding: \"I'd rather be an optimist and harbour these dreams in my heart - sometimes they come true in politics.\"",
      "Sir Keir went on to emphasise that Poland and the UK share an \"unbreakable commitment\" to both Nato and Ukraine.",
      "Hailing a UK-Poland treaty, which is yet to be ratified, the prime minister said it would cover all aspects of threats faced by the two countries, including \"deepening ties between our defence industries\".",
      "His visit to Poland comes one day after he pledged to put Ukraine in the \"strongest possible position\" on a trip to Kyiv where he signed a \"landmark\" 100-year pact with the war-stricken country.",
      "The prime minister condemned the lack of consistency when people use the phrase \"never again\", as people rightly condemn the persecution of Jewish people during World War Two, but fail to call out antisemitism in other circumstances.",
      "\"But where is never again, when we see the poison of antisemitism rising around the world in aftermath of October 7?",
      "\"Where is never again, when the pulse of fear is beating in our own Jewish community, as people are despicably targeted once again for the very same reason, because they are Jewish,\" Sir Keir added.",
      "The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust has said that antisemitism in the UK and globally has increased significantly following 7 October attacks in Israel by Hamas and the subsequent war in Gaza.",
      "Hamas fighters stormed across Israel's southern border on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza. Israel retaliated with a military offensive, which has been ongoing for more than 15 months.",
      "Last August, the Community Security Trust - a Jewish security charity - said reports of antisemitic incidents in the UK in the first half of 2024 had reached another record high. The charity said the record-high figures were a continuation of the impact of antisemitic reactions to the 7 October attack and ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "Sir Keir's visit comes as Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, which is due to begin on Sunday.",
      "The agreement, more than 15 months after the start of the war in Gaza, will see 33 hostages taken from Israel by Hamas returned in the first stage of the deal, Qatari negotiators have said."

    "summary": "The Tory leader said her party wanted to look at greater means-testing of government support.",
    "story": [
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has triggered a row after saying her party wants to explore greater means-testing of government support.",
      "Speaking on LBC Radio, she said the UK had a poor record in prioritising assistance to those who need it the most.",
      "Her comments, in response to a question about the state pension, led other parties to accuse her of wanting to water down the \"triple lock\" uprating policy.",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this was on the cards, accusing Labour and the Liberal Democrats of misrepresenting her.",
      "He added that the party would \"look at means testing\" - but did not specify which benefits would be in scope.",
      "How much is the state pension going up?",
      "Why do politicians keep talking about locks?",
      "During a phone-in on LBC, Badenoch said the UK, like other Western nations, faced a \"structural problem\" because people were living longer while having fewer children.",
      "She added that \"serious thinking\" was required to address the financial impact of more government spending \"on later life\".",
      "Asked whether this included the \"triple lock\" policy - under which state pension payments go up every year by the highest of inflation, average earnings or 2.5% - she replied: \"That's exactly the sort of thing that the policy work we are going to be doing will look at\".",
      "But pressed on whether her party would really look at the \"triple lock\", she then added: \"No, we are going to look at means-testing\".",
      "She went on to add: \"Means-testing is something which we don't do properly here.",
      "\"Starting with the triple lock is not how to solve the problem, we need to start with why are we not making the same kind of money we used to make?\"",
      "'Bungling Badenoch'",
      "However, her comments were seized on by opposition parties to suggest the Tories were planning to shift their stance on the triple lock, which Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats all pledged to continue in last year's general election.",
      "Labour said the Tory leader had \"let the mask slip\" and was preparing to cut the state pension, while the Liberal Democrats said \"bungling Badenoch\" was preparing to make pension cuts \"her first new policy\".",
      "A Tory spokesman denied this, adding the party had \"always protected the triple lock\" and accusing Labour of \"skewing her words for political gain\".",
      "However, the party has yet to clarify which benefits it would consider subjecting to means-testing, when the level of support is linked in some way to a claimant's income or wealth.",
      "Current benefits paid in this way include housing benefit, Universal Credit and pension credit, a top-up paid to poorer pensioners.",
      "Speaking later on Sky News, Tory co-chair Nigel Huddleston did not clarify the party's position either, but said it wanted to look at a \"whole bunch of policy areas\".",
      "It is not the first time Badenoch has been embroiled in a row over comments made during media appearances.",
      "As a Tory leadership candidate last September, she appeared to suggest maternity pay was \"excessive\" before later arguing she was making a more general point about the burden of regulations on business.",
      "'Unsustainable'",
      "Originally a Lib Dem manifesto commitment in the 2010 general election, the state pension triple lock was embraced by the Conservatives when the two parties entered office as a coalition government.",
      "It has since has been in place ever since, save for a temporary suspension during the Covid pandemic, and has also been adopted by Labour.",
      "At the last election, Rishi Sunak pledged to strengthen the uprating policy further by applying it to pensioners' income tax thresholds too.",
      "However some economists have questioned whether the policy is financially sustainable given increasing life expectancy. Others have questioned whether it is fair, given working-age benefits do not increase in the same way.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride has argued the policy is \"unsustainable\" in the \"very, very long term\".",
      "Since taking office Labour has decided to means-test the winter fuel payment, a \u00a3200-\u00a3300 pension supplement that was previously paid to all pensioners, by linking eligibility to pension credit.",
      "Badenoch said she opposed that decision, arguing it would mean pensioners \"on the breadline\" would miss out. She added, however, that she supported the idea it should not go to \"millionaires\".",
      "Writing later on X, Badenoch said the government needed \"better mechanisms\" to target support, instead of using \"proxies\" such as eligibility for pension credit or free school meals."

    "published": "Sat, 18 Jan 2025 01:05:32 GMT",
    "summary": "Gas from the seafloor has scientists wondering if oxygen could be found in the oceans of other planets.",
    "story": [
      "Scientists who recently discovered that metal lumps on the dark seabed make oxygen, have announced plans to study the deepest parts of Earth's oceans in order to understand the strange phenomenon.",
      "Their mission could \"change the way we look at the possibility of life on other planets too,\" the researchers say.",
      "The initial discovery confounded marine scientists. It was previously accepted that oxygen could only be produced in sunlight by plants - in a process called photosynthesis.",
      "If oxygen - a vital component of life - is made in the dark by metal lumps, the researchers believe that process could be happening on other planets, creating oxygen-rich environments where life could thrive.",
      "Lead researcher Prof Andrew Sweetman explained: \"We are already in conversation with experts at Nasa who believe dark oxygen could reshape our understanding of how life might be sustained on other planets without direct sunlight.",
      "\"We want to go out there and figure out what exactly is going on.\"",
      "A dark, controversial discovery",
      "The initial discovery triggered a global scientific row - there was criticism of the findings from some scientists and from deep sea mining companies that plan to harvest the precious metals in the seabed nodules.",
      "If oxygen is produced at these extreme depths, in total darkness, that calls into question what life could survive and thrive on the seafloor, and what impact mining activities could have on that marine life.",
      "That means that seabed mining companies and environmental organisations - some of which claimed that the findings provided evidence that seafloor mining plans should be halted - will be watching this new investigation closely.",
      "The plan is to work at sites where the seabed is more than 10km (6.2 miles) deep, using remotely operated submersible equipment.",
      "\"We have instruments that can go to the deepest parts of the ocean,\" explained Prof Sweetman. \"We're pretty confident we'll find it happening elsewhere, so we'll start probing what's causing it.\"",
      "Some of those experiments, in collaboration with scientists at Nasa, will aim to understand whether the same process could allow microscopic life to thrive beneath oceans that are on other planets and moons.",
      "\"If there's oxygen,\" said Prof Sweetman, \"there could be microbial life taking advantage of that.\"",
      "To mine or not to mine",
      "The initial, biologically baffling findings were published last year in the journal Nature Geoscience. They came from several expeditions to an area of the deep sea between Hawaii and Mexico, where Prof Sweetman and his colleagues sent sensors to the seabed - at about 5km (3.1 miles) depth.",
      "That area is part of a vast swathe of seafloor that is covered with the naturally occurring metal nodules, which form when dissolved metals in seawater collect on fragments of shell - or other debris. It's a process that takes millions of years.",
      "Sensors that the team deployed repeatedly showed oxygen levels going up.",
      "\"I just ignored it, Prof Sweetman told BBC News at the time, \"because I'd been taught that you only get oxygen through photosynthesis\".",
      "Eventually, he and his colleagues stopped ignoring their readings and set out instead to understand what was going on. Experiments in their lab - with nodules that the team collected submerged in beakers of seawater - led the scientists to conclude that the metallic lumps were making oxygen out of seawater. The nodules, they found, generated electric currents that could split (or electrolyse) molecules of seawater into hydrogen and oxygen.",
      "Then came the backlash, in the form of rebuttals - posted online - from scientists and from seabed mining companies.",
      "One of the critics, Michael Clarke from the Metals Company, a Canadian deep sea mining company, told BBC News that the criticism was focused on a \"lack of scientific rigour in the experimental design and data collection\". Basically, he and other critics claimed there was no oxygen production - just bubbles that the equipment produced during sample collection.",
      "\"We've ruled out that possibility,\" Prof Sweetman responded. \"But these [new] experiments will provide the proof.\"",
      "This might seem a niche, technical argument, but several multi-billion pound mining companies are already exploring the possibility of harvesting tonnes of these metals from the seafloor.",
      "The natural deposits they are targeting contain metals vital for making batteries, and demand for those metals is increasing rapidly as many economies move from fossil fuels to, for example, electric vehicles.",
      "The race to extract those resources has caused concern among environmental groups and researchers. More than 900 marine scientists from 44 countries have signed a petition\u00a0highlighting the environmental risks and calling for a pause on mining activity.",
      "Talking about his team's latest research mission at a press conference on Friday, Prof Sweetman said: \"Before we do anything, we need to - as best as possible - understand the [deep sea] ecosystem.",
      "\"I think the right decision is to hold off before we decide if this is the right thing to do as a a global society.\""

    "story": [
      "After lying hidden beneath metres of volcanic rock and ash for 2,000 years, a \"once-in-a-century\" find has been unearthed in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in Italy.",
      "Archaeologists have discovered a sumptuous private bathhouse - potentially the largest ever found there - complete with hot, warm and cold rooms, exquisite artwork, and a huge plunge pool.",
      "The spa-like complex sits at the heart of a grand residence uncovered over the last two years during a major excavation.",
      "\"It's these spaces that really are part of the 'Pompeii effect' - it's almost as if the people had only left a minute ago,\" says Dr Gabriel Zuchtriegel, director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, who has revealed the new find exclusively to BBC News.",
      "Analysis of two skeletons discovered in the house also shows the horror faced by Pompeii's inhabitants when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD79.",
      "The bodies belonged to a woman, aged between 35 and 50, who was clutching jewellery and coins, and a younger man in his teens or early 20s.",
      "They had barricaded themselves into a small room, but were killed as a tsunami of superheated volcanic gas and ash - known as a pyroclastic flow - ripped through the town.",
      "\"This is a dramatic place, and everything you find here tells you about the drama,\" says Pompeii conservator, Dr Ludovica Alesse.",
      "A third of the ancient city still lies hidden beneath volcanic debris from the disaster, but the new excavation - the most extensive in a generation - provides new insights into ancient Roman life.",
      "The archaeologists have been followed by a documentary team from the BBC and Lion TV, for a series called Pompeii: The New Dig.",
      "An entire block of Pompeii has now been uncovered, revealing a laundry and bakery, as well as the large private house. It's thought these were all owned by one wealthy individual, possibly Aulus Rustius Verus, an influential Pompeii politician.",
      "The discovery of the bathhouse is further confirmation of his elite status, says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "\"There are just a few houses that have a private bath complex, so it was something really for the wealthiest of the wealthy,\" he says. \"And this is so huge - it's probably the biggest bath complex in a Pompeiian private home.\"",
      "Those lucky enough to use the suite of bathing rooms would have undressed in a changing room with vibrant red walls and a mosaic floor dotted with geometric patterns inlaid with marble from across the Roman Empire.",
      "They would then head to the hot room, taking a dip in a bath and enjoying the sauna-like warmth, provided by a suspended floor that allowed hot air to flow underneath and walls with a cavity where the heat could circulate.",
      "Next they would move to the brightly-painted warm room, where oil would be rubbed into the skin, before being scraped off with a curved instrument called a strigil.",
      "Finally, they would enter the largest and most spectacular room of all - the frigidarium, or cold room. Surrounded by red columns and frescoes of athletes, a visitor could cool off in the plunge pool, which is so large 20-30 people could fit in it.",
      "\"In the hot summers, you could sit with your feet in the water, chatting with your friends, maybe enjoying a cup of wine,\" says Dr Zuchtriegel.",
      "The bathhouse is the latest find to emerge from this extraordinary house.",
      "A huge banqueting room with jet black walls and breathtaking artwork of classical scenes was found last year. A smaller, more intimate room - painted in pale blue - where residents of the house would go and pray to the gods was also unearthed.",
      "The residence was mid-renovation - tools and building materials have been found throughout. In the blue room a pile of oyster shells lie on the floor, ready to be ground up and applied to the walls to give them an iridescent shimmer.",
      "Next door to this beautiful space, in a cramped room with barely any decoration, a stark discovery was made - the remains of two Pompeiians who failed to escape from the eruption.",
      "The skeleton of a woman was found lying on top of a bed, curled up in a foetal position. The body of a man was in the corner of this small room.",
      "\"The pyroclastic flow from Vesuvius came along the street just outside this room, and caused a wall to collapse, and that had basically crushed him to death,\" explains Dr Sophie Hay, an archaeologist at Pompeii.",
      "\"The woman was still alive while he was dying - imagine the trauma - and then this room filled with the rest of the pyroclastic flow, and that's how she died.\"",
      "Analysis of the male skeleton showed that despite his young age, his bones had signs of wear and tear, suggesting he was of lower status, possibly even a slave.",
      "The woman was older, but her bones and teeth were in good condition.",
      "\"She was probably someone higher up in society,\" says Dr Hay. \"She could have been the wife of the owner of the house - or maybe an assistant looking after the wife, we just don't know.\"",
      "An assortment of items were found on a marble table top in the room - glassware, bronze jugs and pottery - perhaps brought into the room where the pair had tucked themselves away hoping to wait out the eruption.",
      "But it's the items clutched by the victims that are of particular interest. The younger man held some keys, while the older woman was found with gold and silver coins and jewellery.",
      "These are kept in Pompeii's vault, along with the city's other priceless finds, and we were given a chance to see them with archaeologist, Dr Alessandro Russo.",
      "The gold coins still gleam as if they were new, and he shows us delicate gold and natural pearl earrings, necklace pendants and intricately etched semi-precious stones.",
      "\"When we find this kind of object, the distance from ancient times and modern times disappears,\" Dr Russo says, \"and we can touch a small piece of the life of these people who died in the eruption.\"",
      "Dr Sophie Hay describes the private bathhouse complex as a once-in-a-century discovery, which also sheds more light on a darker side of Roman life.",
      "Just behind the hot room is a boiler room. A pipe brought water in from the street - with some syphoned off into the cold plunge pool - and the rest was heated in a lead boiler destined for the hot room. The valves that regulated the flow look so modern it's as if you could turn them on and off even today.",
      "With a furnace sitting beneath, the conditions in this room would have been unbearably hot for the slaves who had to keep the whole system going.",
      "\"The most powerful thing from these excavations is that stark contrast between the lives of the slaves and the very, very rich. And here we see it,\" says Dr Sophie Hay.",
      "\"The difference between the sumptuous life of the bathhouse, compared to the furnace room, where the slaves would be feeding the fire toiling all day.",
      "\"A wall is all that could divide you between two different worlds.\"",
      "The excavation is in its final weeks - but new discoveries continue to emerge from the ash. Limited numbers of visitors are allowed to visit the dig while it's ongoing, but eventually it will be fully opened to the public.",
      "\"Every day here is a surprise,\" says Dr Anna Onesti, director of the excavation.",
      "\"Sometimes in the morning I come to work thinking that it's a normal working day - and then I discover we found something exceptional.",

      "There is no one answer, experts say. It depends on the availability of prey in a given area -  ideally, each tiger should be in the vicinity of about 500 prey animals, such as deer, antelopes or wild buffalo, tiger biologist Ullas Karanth says.",
      "Experts argue that Oli's concern with capping tiger numbers is misplaced. Rather, Nepal's government should focus on \"expanding protected areas that have reasonable natural densities of prey and tigers,\" Dr Karanth adds.",
      "If wildlife is spilling out of protected areas in search of prey, that might explain why so many attacks have happened in places that border forests, where tigers have always encountered humans.",
      "An example is the \"buffer zones\" that lie between national parks and human settlements. Wildlife sightings are common here, but locals also use the area for cattle-grazing and collecting fodder and firewood.",
      "Forest corridors - strips of land that connect different parks and bio-reserves allowing wildlife to roam between them - have emerged as yet another flashpoint. Roads sometimes run through these areas, and locals also use them for foraging, leaving them vulnerable to attacks.",
      "The rise in human fatalities is a sign that Nepal's once-successful conservation model is cracking, zoologist Karan Shah says.",
      "\"So far, [Nepal's] focus seems to be on winning international attention, while ignoring the impact on communities living around national parks and protected areas,\" Mr Shah adds.",
      "He argues that conservation is not just \"an ecological or scientific issue\" but also a social one - and that the loss of human lives must be prevented so local communities remain a part of the conservation effort and don't turn against it. Anger among locals has also been growing as tigers have been preying on livestock.",
      "\"A significant portion of our population still live in rural areas and are dependent on forest resources that they help conserve - but they are now increasingly being killed and injured by tigers,\" Thakur Bhandari, president of Federation of Community Forestry Users Nepal, told the BBC.",
      "\"As forest conservationists we cannot be against wildlife, but that does not mean we should ignore its impact on humans and our society.\"",
      "A success story turned deadly",
      "A century ago, some 100,000 tigers roamed Asia - but deforestation and rampant poaching pushed them to the brink of extinction. There are now only about 5,600 wild tigers remaining across 13 countries, including Nepal, China, India, Thailand, Indonesia and Russia.",
      "All of these nations had committed to doubling their tiger numbers by 2022, but Nepal was the first to surpass the target - due in part to a zero-poaching initiative and a doubling of the country's forest cover between 1992 and 2016.",
      "Connecting 16 protected zones in southern Nepal with areas across the border in northern India created forest corridors which helped too.",
      "The growing number of tiger attacks has now tarnished that achievement.",
      "Oli believes Nepal's tiger population is growing at the cost of human lives. Viable solutions, however, are not easy to come by.",
      "The parks and wildlife department has acknowledged the challenge of managing tigers in Nepal, where those that kill humans are tracked down and taken into captivity.",
      "\"Zoos and rescue centres are already overwhelmed with problematic tigers,\" the department said in a conservation report published in 2023. \"A comprehensive protocol is urgently needed to cope with the rescue, handling, and rehabilitation of problem animals.\"",
      "Oli has proposed sending Nepal's tigers abroad.",
      "\"People love to keep birds like falcons and peacocks as pets, so why not tigers?\" he suggested. \"That would boost their status too.\"",
      "Others have different ideas.",
      "Dr Karanth says tigers that have repeatedly taken human lives should be \"killed immediately\". Some argue that humans exacerbated the problem by encroaching into the tigers' natural habitats, using the land for cultivation or infrastructure and reducing the big cats' prey-base.",
      "The BBC spoke to a wildlife management expert, meanwhile, who claims Oli wants to bring down tiger numbers so that more land can be cleared to build infrastructure.",
      "\"It is not about people's safety,\" he said.",
      "For now the situation is at an impasse. It's unclear whether Oli's \"tiger diplomacy\" suggestion will gain traction, or whether over-encroaching humans or tigers are to blame for Nepal's tiger attack crisis.",
      "What is clear is that humans and tigers are struggling to achieve peaceful co-existence in Nepal - and the country's conservation success story has brought many of its own thorny problems to reckon with.",

      "The second time, it said there had been a glitch while trying to bring the satellites closer, but added that the spacecraft were safe.",
      "On Sunday, Isro said scientists had managed to reduce the distance between the Chaser and the Target first to 15metres and then to 3metres. They said after the trial attempt, the spacecraft were \"moved back to safe distance\" and that they were analysing data.",
      "S Somanath, who was Isro chief when SpaDeX (short for Space Docking Experiment) was launched and was monitoring its progress until his retirement a few days ago, had described docking as \"a very complex process\" that needed extreme precision and coordination.",
      "To begin with, the two spacecraft had to be in the same orbit so that the Chaser could start to approach the Target.",
      "On Thursday morning, scientists began by gradually reducing the speed of the two spacecraft - bringing them ever closer until they were just 3 metres apart. Then their connectors were latched together.",
      "In the next step, the two spacecraft were screwed on perfectly, creating an airtight passage for safe transfer of material or crew, completing space docking.",
      "An Isro official told the BBC that over the next two-three days, the mission will carry out what is being billed as one of its most important experiments - it will transfer electrical power from the Chaser to Target.",
      "This, Ms Mitra, says is to demonstrate that a spacecraft can be sent to service another in space.",
      "The experiment will then demonstrate \"undocking and separation of the two satellites\".",
      "Ms Mitra says the mission will also test India's capabilities for inter-satellite communication as during the docking and undocking, the spacecraft will have to communicate with the Earth station and also with each other so that they know each other's position and velocity.",
      "The spacecraft are also carrying scientific instruments and cameras which will then be deployed. Over the next two years, they will measure radiation in space and monitor natural resources on Earth.",

    "summary": "What does Donald Trump's executive order mean for the future of TikTok in the US?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order granting TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law banning the app if it is not sold.",
      "The social media platform briefly went dark in the US days before Trump took office, after the Supreme Court denied a bid by its Chinese owner ByteDance to overturn the legislation.",
      "TikTok came back online with a short message thanking Trump for his \"efforts\".",
      "Has Trump overturned the TikTok ban?",
      "An executive order is an instruction from the president which has the weight of the law behind it.",
      "But Trump's order does not overturn the ban.",
      "Instead it tells the US attorney general not to enforce the law for now - something experts had expected would be his first move.",
      "That buys time for his administration to, as the order puts it, \"determine the appropriate course of action.\"",
      "Trump has floated the possibility of TikTok becoming a joint venture, telling reporters he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between \"the United States\" and ByteDance, though he did not give any further details on how that might work.",
      "For now though the order creates a situation where the president is directly opposing a ruling made by the Supreme Court, which upheld the law to ban TikTok on 17 January.",
      "It said the ban was \"designed to prevent China - a designated foreign adversary - from leveraging its control over ByteDance to capture the personal data of US TikTok users\".",
      "Technically, even after the 75 days have passed, it would be possible for Trump to allow the law to stand but tell the Department of Justice (DoJ) to continue to ignore it.",
      "The government would be effectively telling Apple and Google they will not be punished for continuing to allow people to download TikTok onto their devices, meaning the law would remain in place but would essentially be redundant.",
      "It is not clear whether the firms would continue to offer the app under these circumstances.",
      "Could TikTok ever be banned in the UK too?",
      "Could Elon Musk, MrBeast or Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary buy TikTok?",
      "When Trump signed the executive order, he said \"every rich person has called me\" to signal their interest in TikTok.",
      "ByteDance has long insisted that its prize asset was not for sale.",
      "Despite this, Bloomberg News reported that the firm was considering a sale to Trump ally Elon Musk. However, TikTok described this as \"pure fiction\".",
      "Billionaire Frank McCourt and the Canadian businessman Kevin O'Leary - a celebrity investor on Shark Tank, the US version of Dragon's Den - are behind a separate bid to buy the platform without its algorithm.",
      "Mr McCourt, a former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team, said he had secured $20bn (\u00a316. 3bn) from a consortium of investors.",
      "The biggest YouTuber in the world Jimmy Donaldson - AKA MrBeast - has also claimed he is in the running after a number of investors contacted him following an earlier tweet signalling his interest.",
      "A US search engine called Perplexity AI has also reportedly offered to merge with TikTok.",
      "In March 2024, Trump's former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he wanted to put together a group to buy the app but it is not clear if he is still pursuing this.",
      "What about TikTok's sister apps Lemon8 and CapCut?",
      "TikTok was the only ByteDance app which came back immediately - though only for people who already had the app.",
      "It is still not available to download from Apple and Google's app stores.",
      "Two other apps which remain inaccessible are Lemon8, another social media app which has been compared to Pinterest, and CapCut, a video editing app.",
      "Meanwhile Marvel Snap, a digital card game published by a ByteDance subsidiary, is now available once again after it too went down - which caught even its US-based developer Second Dinner off guard.",
      "What other platforms could TikTok users use instead?",
      "TikTok says it has 170 million US users who spent - on average - 51 minutes per day on the app in 2024.",
      "Experts say rivals such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts could benefit if Trump's efforts to fully restore TikTok don't succeed.",
      "Users bring advertisers - so this could be a big financial boost to those platforms.",
      "\"Chief marketing officers who we've spoken with confirmed that they will divert their media dollars to Meta and Google if they can no longer advertise on TikTok,\" said Kelsey Chickering, an analyst at market research company Forrester.",
      "Other potential winners include Twitch, which made its name by hosting livestreams - a popular feature on TikTok. Twitch is well known particularly to gamers, though its other content is expanding too.",
      "Other Chinese-owned platforms, such as Xiaohongshu - known as RedNote among its US users - have also seen rapid growth in the US and the UK."

      "All websites on which pornographic material can be found, including social media platforms, must introduce \"robust\" age-checking techniques such as demanding photo ID or running credit card checks for UK users by July.",
      "The long-awaited guidance, issued by regulator Ofcom, has been made under the Online Safety Act (OSA), and is intended to prevent children from easily accessing pornography online.",
      "Research indicates the average age at which young people first see explicit material online in the UK is 13 - with many being exposed to it much earlier.",
      "\"For too long, many online services which allow porn and other harmful material have ignored the fact that children are accessing their services\", said Ofcom boss Melanie Dawes, adding: \"today, this starts to change.\"",

      "Other age verification firms have responded positively to the news.",

    "title": "'A long fight full of tears': Why Thailand became a haven for LGBT couples",
    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 22:59:59 GMT",
    "summary": "Thailand is set to legalise same-sex marriage - one of the few places in Asia to do so. Why is it an outlier?",
    "story": [
      "\"It has been a long fight full of tears for us.\"",
      "That is how Ann \"Waaddao\" Chumaporn describes the years that led to this moment \u2013 on Thursday, when same-sex marriage becomes legal in Thailand, and more than a hundred couples will tie the knot in one of Bangkok's biggest shopping malls, in a riot of colour and celebration.",
      "And the same question which has been heard throughout the long campaign to get the equal marriage law passed will be asked again: why Thailand? Why nowhere else, aside from Taiwan and Nepal, in Asia?",
      "People think they know the answer. Thailand is famously open to and accepting of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people. They have long been visible in all walks of life. Thai people are easy-going about pretty much everything. \"Mai pen rai\" \u2013 no big deal \u2013 is a national catch-phrase. Buddhist beliefs, followed by more than 90% of Thais, don't forbid LGBT lifestyles. Surely, then, equal marriage was inevitable.",
      "Except it wasn't. \"It was not easy,\" says Ms Waaddao, who organises Bangkok Pride March.",
      "The first Pride march in Thailand took place only 25 years ago. Back then it was hard to get approval from the police, and the march was a chaotic, unfocused event. After 2006 only two marches took place until 2022. In 2009 one planned Pride march in Chiang Mai had to be abandoned because of the threat of violence.",
      "\"We were not accepted, by our own families and by society,\" Ms Waaddao adds. \"There were times when we did not think marriage equality would ever happen, but we never gave up.\"",
      "'We did not fight, we negotiated'",
      "For all of Thailand's general tolerance of LGBT people, getting equal rights, including marriage, required a determined campaign to change attitudes in Thai officialdom and society. And attitudes have changed.",
      "When Chakkrit \"Ink\" Vadhanavira started dating his partner in 2001, they were both actors playing leading roles in TV series. At that time homosexuality was still officially described by the Thai Ministry of Health as a mental illness.",
      "Marriage equality eludes Japan's same-sex couples",
      "Why legalising gay sex in India is not a Western idea",
      "\"Back then society could not accept leading male roles being played by a gay man. There was lots of gossip about us in the media, much of it untrue, which really stressed us,\" Mr Chakkrit recalls.",
      "\"We decided then that if we were going to date each other, we had to leave showbiz.\"",
      "They are still together but they have stayed out of the limelight for more than 20 years, running a successful production company.",
      "A lot has changed in that time \u2013 and their industry gets some credit for that.",
      "The way LGBT characters are portrayed in Thai TV dramas, from comical oddities to mainstream roles, made a big difference, according to Tinnaphop Sinsomboonthong, an assistant professor at Thammasat University who self-identifies as queer.",
      "\"Nowadays they represent us as normal characters, like you see in real life,\" he says. \"The kind of LGBTQ+ colleague you might have in the office, or your LGBTQ+ neighbour.  This really helped change perceptions and values in all generations.\"",
      "The so-called Boy Love dramas have helped bring the rest of society round to the idea of not just tolerance, but full acceptance and equal rights for the community.",
      "These romantic television dramas featuring love affairs between beautiful young men have grown enormously in popularity over the past decade, especially during the Covid pandemic.",
      "They are now one of Thailand's most successful cultural exports, with huge audiences in places like China. Series like My School President and Love Sick have got hundreds of millions of views on streaming networks.",
      "At the same time, activists became more focused and united in their bid to get the law changed. The many different LGBT groups came together in the Change 1448 campaign \u2013 1448 is the clause in the Thai Civil Code covering the definition of marriage \u2013 and later under the Rainbow Coalition for Marriage Equality.",
      "They linked up with other groups fighting for greater rights and freedoms in Thailand, and they learned to work with political parties in parliament to persuade them to change their stance on the law.",
      "The resumption of Pride marches in 2022, and getting the government to recognise and promote the appeal of Thailand as an attractive destination for LGBT travellers also helped change public perceptions.",
      "\"We did not fight, we negotiated,\" Mr Tinnaphop says. \"We knew we had to talk to Thai society, and little by little, we shifted attitudes.\"",
      "The right political moment",
      "Getting the equal marriage law through parliament was also helped by political developments in Thailand.",
      "For five years following a coup in 2014, the country was ruled by a conservative military government, which was willing only to consider recognising civil partnerships for LGBT couples, without full rights like inheritance.",
      "But in the 2019 election which returned Thailand to civilian rule, a new, youthful reformist party called Future Forward, which fully supported equal marriage, did unexpectedly well. They won the third-largest share of seats, revealing a growing hunger for change in Thailand.",
      "When a year later Future Forward was dissolved by a controversial court verdict, it set off months of student-led protests calling for sweeping reforms, including curbs to the monarchy's power.",
      "LGBT campaigners were prominent in those protests, giving them greater national prominence. The protests eventually died down, with many of the leaders arrested for questioning the monarchy's role.",
      "But in the 2023 election the successor to Future Forward, calling itself Move Forward, performed even better than in 2019, winning more seats than any other party. Again, it was clear that the desire for change was felt across Thai people of all ages.",
      "Move Forward was blocked from forming a government by conservatives who objected to its call for wholesale political reforms.",
      "But by this time, equal marriage was less contentious. Few opposed it. And passing it gave the unwieldy and unpopular coalition government which had been formed without Move Forward a quick accomplishment with which to please most of the country.",
      "Pioneering move may boost tourism",
      "Thailand, though, is an outlier in Asia. Few other countries in the region are likely to follow suit.",
      "The influence of Islam in Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei makes the notion of equal marriage a non-starter. LGBT communities there face discrimination and prosecution; in Brunei sex between men carries the death penalty.",
      "In the Philippines, there is growing acceptance of LGBT couples living together openly. But the Roman Catholic Church vehemently opposes same-sex marriage.",
      "In Vietnam, like Thailand, there are no religious or ideological obstacles, but campaigning to change the law, as happened in Thailand, is difficult under a repressive regime. Much the same is true in China. Until the ruling communist party endorses equal marriage, which it shows no signs of doing, it cannot happen.",
      "Even in democracies like Japan and South Korea \u2013 where political parties are largely conservative and dominated by older men - the prospects look bleak.",
      "\"It is largely conservative Christians who are blocking it,\" says Chae-yoon Han, executive director of the Beyond the Rainbow Foundation in South Korea.",
      "\"Most, if not all, politicians in the conservative party of President Yoon are devout Christians, and they have framed marriage equality as a 'leftist agenda', which could potentially open society to a 'leftist, communist takeover'.\"",
      "India appeared close to legalising same-sex marriage in 2023, when the decision fell to its Supreme Court - but the judges declined, saying it was up to parliament.",
      "So Thailand hopes to benefit from being a pioneer. Tourism is one of the few areas of the Thai economy doing well in the post-pandemic recovery, and the country is seen as a safe and welcoming destination for LGBT holiday-makers.",
      "Growing numbers of same-sex couples from other Asian countries are choosing to live here now.",
      "The legal recognition they can get for their marriages will allow them to raise children and grow old together with nearly all the rights and protections given to heterosexual couples.",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:12:58 GMT",
    "summary": "War appears to have accelerated the spread of pathogens resistant to antibiotics in the country.",
    "story": [
      "When Pte Oleksander Bezverkhny was evacuated to the Feofaniya Hospital in Kyiv, few believed he would live. The 27-year-old had a severe abdominal injury and shrapnel had ripped through his buttocks. Both his legs were amputated.",
      "Then, doctors discovered that his infections were resistant to commonly-used antibiotics \u2013 and the already daunting task of saving his life became almost hopeless.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is when bacteria evolve and learn how to defend themselves against antibiotics and other medicines, rendering them ineffective.",
      "Ukraine is far from the only country affected by this issue: around 1.4 million people globally died of a AMR infection in 2021, and in the UK there were 66,730 serious antibiotic-resistant infections in 2023. However, war appears to have accelerated the spread of multi-resistant pathogens in Ukraine.",
      "Clinics treating war injuries have registered a sharp increase of AMR cases. More than 80% of all patients admitted to Feofaniya Hospital have infections caused by microbes which are resistant to antibiotics, according to deputy chief physician Dr Andriy Strokan.",
      "Ironically, antimicrobial-resistant infections often originate from medical facilities.",
      "Medical staff try to follow strict hygiene protocols and use protective equipment to minimise the spread of these infections but facilities can be overwhelmed with people injured in the war.",
      "Dr Volodymyr Dubyna, the head of the Mechnikov Hospital's ICU, said that since the start of the Russian invasion his unit alone has increased the number of beds from 16 to 50. Meanwhile, with many employees fleeing the war or joining the military themselves, staffing levels are down.",
      "Dr Strokan explained that these circumstances can affect the spread of AMR bacteria. \"In surgical departments there is one nurse that looks after 15-20 patients,\" he said. \"She physically cannot scrub up her hands in the required amount and frequency in order not to spread infections.\"",
      "The nature of this war also means patients are exposed to far more strains of infection than they would be in peacetime. When a soldier is evacuated for medical reasons, they will often pass through multiple facilities, each with their own strains of AMR. While medical professionals say this is unavoidable because of the scale of the war, it only worsens the spread of AMR infections.",
      "This was the case for Pte Bezverkhny who was treated at three different facilities before reaching the hospital in Kyiv. Since his infections could not be treated with the usual medication, his condition deteriorated and he contracted sepsis five times.",
      "This situation is different to other recent conflicts, for example the Afghanistan War, where Western soldiers would be stabilised on site and then air-transferred to a European clinic rather than passing through multiple different local facilities.",
      "This would not be possible in Ukraine as the influx of patients has not been seen since the Second World War, according to Dr Dubyna, whose hospital in Dnipro neighbours front-line regions. Once his patients are stable enough, they are transferred to another clinic \u2013 if it has room \u2013 to free up capacity.",
      "\"In terms of microbiological control, it means they spread [bacteria] further. But if it's not done, we're not able to work. Then it's a catastrophe.\"",
      "With so many wounded, Ukrainian hospitals simply cannot usually afford to isolate infected patients \u2013 meaning that multi-resistant and dangerous bacteria spread unchecked.",
      "The problem is that infections they cause must be treated with special antibiotics from the \"reserve\" list. But the more often doctors prescribe these, the quicker bacteria adapt, making those antibiotics ineffective too.",
      "\"We have to balance our scales,\" Dr Strokan explains. \"On the one hand, we must save a patient. On the other \u2013 we mustn't breed new microorganisms that will have antimicrobial resistance.\"",
      "In Pte Bezverkhny's case, doctors had to use very expensive antibiotics, which volunteers sourced from abroad. After a year in hospital and over 100 operations, his condition is no longer life-threatening.",
      "Doctors managed to save his life. But as pathogens grow more resistant, the struggle to save others only gets harder.",

      "Fourth Wing introduced heroine Violet Sorrengail, a 20-year-old woman who is thrust into brutal training to become an elite dragon rider.",

      "German Muller will work with new signing Esteban Ocon as one of two new race engineers at the US-based team.",
      "Haas' new head of strategy will also be a woman - Carine Cridelich has been recruited from Red Bull's Racing Bulls team and will start work on 1 March.",
      "Race engineer is a key role as the person who works most closely with drivers on the performance, set-up and running of their car. It is their voice that is heard talking to drivers on television broadcasts.",
      "Muller's opposite number on the car of Ocon's team-mate, British rookie Oliver Bearman, will be Ronan O'Hare, another internal recruit who was previously a performance engineer.",
      "Team principal Ayao Komatsu said diversity was increasing in F1, but added: \"It's not like I chose Laura because she's female. We just don't care - nationality, gender, doesn't matter.",
      "\"What matters is work, how you fit into the team, how you can maximise the performance - and Ronan and Laura I believe happen to be the best choice.\"",
      "Komatsu, who became team principal before the 2024 season, said he had wanted to change the race operations team since the early part of last year after spotting weaknesses.",
      "Haas' changes include appointing a new chief race engineer and sporting director, both common positions the low-budget team did not have filled last season.",
      "The new chief race engineer is Francesco Nenci, who most recently worked at Audi's Dakar Rally programme, and has F1 experience with Sauber and Toyota. Mark Lowe, previously Haas' operations team manager, will be sporting director.",
      "\"I felt the trackside team was one of the weakest areas last year, and the more the car became competitive that exposed it more,\" Komatsu said.",
      "\"Towards the end of the year we had the fifth-fastest car. But in terms of execution, we should have finished P6 [in the constructors' championship] but we didn't.",
      "\"Part of it was we left too many points on the table from the trackside operation. So really needed a step-up.\"",
      "Cridelich, from France, follows other female strategy leaders, including Hannah Schmitz, the principal strategy engineer at Red Bull. Ruth Buscombe and Bernie Collins, who previously worked at Sauber and Aston Martin, have both since moved on to broadcasting careers.",
      "Haas have a unique structure in that their in-house operations are pared back as much as possible through their partnership with Ferrari.",
      "Haas uses Ferrari's wind tunnel, has their design team in Italy at Maranello and buys virtually all the parts from Ferrari permitted in the rules for their car, designing only the aerodynamic surfaces and chassis.",
      "Their headquarters are in Kannapolis, North Carolina, but the race team runs out of a modest factory in Banbury, Oxfordshire.",
      "Komatsu said this would be the first year that Haas would have sufficient budget to reach F1's budget cap. A further change in approach is that they would not be using Ferrari's latest redesigned front suspension, preferring to stick with last year's design for consistency of aerodynamic research.",
      "Haas finished seventh overall last year, ahead of Racing Bulls, Williams and Sauber, and Komatsu said his sights were \"set on consistency\".",
      "\"In history with Haas across the years, I don't think we have been competitive across the seasons in a similar manner,\" he said.",
      "He added that he had ambitions to further improve a team he said was \"punching above its weight\" for its limited resources.",
      "\"Who [else] only has 300 people or operates out of this kind of building?\" Komatsu said.",
      "\"If Williams operated to their potential, there is no way we could be beating them. I want to get to a place where we can beat those sorts of people on merit without people screwing up.\"",

      "Niluper says there were always rumours about deportation but it was difficult to find out more. Escaping was hard because they had children with them.",
      "\"It was horrible. We were so scared all the time,\" recalls Niluper.",
      "\"When we thought about being sent back to China, we would have preferred to die in Thailand.\"",
      "China accused of closing and destroying mosques",
      "China 'sending Uighur children to orphanages'",
      "China's repression of the Muslim Uyghurs has been well documented by the UN and human rights groups. Up to one million Uyghurs are believed to have been detained in re-education camps, in what human rights advocates say is a state campaign to eradicate Uyghur identity and culture. There are many allegations of torture and enforced disappearances, which China denies. It says it has been running \"vocational centres\" focused on de-radicalising Uyghurs.",
      "Niluper says she and her husband faced hostility from Chinese state officials over their religiosity - her husband was an avid reader of religious texts.",
      "The couple made the decision to flee when people they knew were being arrested or disappearing. The family were in a group of 220 Uyghurs who were caught by the Thai police trying to cross the border to Malaysia in March 2014.",
      "Niluper was held in an IDC near the border, and then later in Bangkok, until with 170 other women and children, she was allowed in June 2015 to go to Turkey, which usually offers Uyghurs asylum.",
      "But her husband remains in the Bangkok IDC. They were separated when they were detained, and she has had no contact with him since a brief meeting they were permitted in July 2014.",
      "She says she was one of 18 pregnant women and 25 children crammed into a room that was just four by eight metres. The food was \"bad and there was never enough for all of us\".",
      "\"I was the last one to give birth, at midnight, in the bathroom. The next day the guard saw my condition and that of my baby was not good, so they took us to the hospital.\"",
      "Niluper was also separated from her eldest son, who was just two years old at the time and held with his father \u2013 an experience which she says has traumatised him, after experiencing \"terrible conditions\" and witnessing a guard beating an inmate. When the guards brought him back to her, she says, he did not recognise her.",
      "\"He was so scared, screaming and crying. He could not understand what had happened. He did not want to talk to anyone.\"",
      "It took a long time before he accepted his mother, she says, and after that he would not leave her even for a moment, even after they had arrived in Turkey.",
      "\"It took a really, really long time for him to understand that he was finally in a safe place.\"",
      "Pressure from Beijing",
      "Thailand has never explained why it will not allow the remaining Uyghurs to join their families in Turkey, but it is almost certainly because of pressure from China.",
      "Unlike other inmates in the IDC, the fate of the Uyghurs is not handled by the Immigration Department but instead by Thailand's National Security Council, a body chaired by the prime minister in which the military has significant influence.",
      "As the influence of the US, Thailand's oldest military ally, wanes, that of China has been steadily increasing. The current Thai government is keen to build even closer ties to China, to help revive the faltering economy.",
      "The United Nations Refugee Agency has been accused of doing little to help the Uyghurs, but says it is given no access to them, so is unable to do much. Thailand does not recognise refugee status.",
      "Accommodating China's wish to get the Uyghurs back is not without risk though. Thailand has just taken a seat on the UN Human Rights Council, for which it lobbied hard.",
      "Deporting 48 men who have already endured more than a decade of incarceration would badly tarnish the image the Thai government is trying to project.",
      "Thailand will also be mindful of what happened just a month after the last mass deportation in 2015.",
      "On 17 August that year a powerful bomb exploded at a shrine in Bangkok which was popular with Chinese tourists. Twenty people were killed, in what was widely assumed to be a retaliation by Uyghur militants, although the Thai authorities tried to downplay the link.",
      "Two Uyghur men were charged with the bombing, but their trial has lasted for nine years, with no end in sight. One of them, say his lawyers, is almost certainly innocent. A veil of secrecy surrounds the trial; the authorities seem reluctant to let anything from the hearings tying the bomb to the deportation to get out.",
      "Even those Uyghurs who have managed to get to Turkey must then deal with their uncertain status there, and with the severance of all communications with their families in Xinjiang.",
      "\"I have not heard my mother's voice for 10 years,\" says Hasan Imam, an Uyghur refugee who now works as a lorry driver in Turkey.",
      "He was in the same group as Niluper caught by the Malaysian border in 2014.",
      "He remembers how the following year the Thai authorities deceived them about their plan to deport some of them to China. He says they were told some men would be moved to a different facility, because the one they were in was too crowded.",
      "This was after some women and children had been sent to Turkey, and, unusually, the men in the camp were also allowed to talk to their wives and children in Turkey on a phone.",
      "\"We were all happy, and full of hope,\" Hassan says. \"They selected them, one by one. At this point they had no idea they would be sent back to China. It was only later, through an illicit phone we had, that we found out from Turkey that they had been deported.\"",
      "This filled the remaining detainees with despair, recalls Hasan, and two years later, when he was moved temporarily to another holding camp, he and 19 others made a remarkable escape, using a nail to make a hole in a crumbling wall.",
      "Eleven were recaptured, but Hasan managed to cross the forested border into Malaysia, and from there reached Turkey.",
      "\"I do not know what condition my parents are in but for those still detained in Thailand it is even worse,\" he says.",
      "They fear being sent back and imprisoned in China \u2013 and they also fear that it would mean more severe punishment for their families, he explains.",

      "When it comes to trade, Trump is clearly as livid with the EU now as he was during his first term in office. The bloc sells far more to the United States than it imports from the US. In January 2022, the trade surplus was \u20ac15.4 billion (\u00a313 billion).",
      "Donald Trump's answer? He says he'll impose blanket tariffs on all foreign imports of 10-20%, with even higher tariffs on certain goods like cars.",
      "That's a disaster scenario for Germany, which relies on exports and the automobile industry in particular. Its economy is already spluttering - last year it shrunk by 0.2%.",
      "As the biggest economy in the eurozone, financial difficulties in Germany risk affecting the currency as a whole.",

      "Germany is 'top of Trump's hit list'",
      "Merkel has said that when he was president last time, Trump appeared to have it in for Germany.",
      "Ian Bond, the deputy director for the Centre for European Reform, believes the country will remain \"top of Trump's (European) hit list.\"",
      "\"What he said in the past is things like, he doesn't want to see any Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York. Now, this is kind of nuts, because, actually, most of the Mercedes-Benz that you see on the streets of New York are made in Alabama, where Mercedes has a big plant.",
      "\"He has often been more hostile to Germany than any other country in Europe. It might be slightly easier for Germany with a new and more conservative government (after the upcoming general election), but I wouldn't be holding my breath.\"",
      "The UK hopes to avoid Trump tariffs as it doesn't have such a trade imbalance with the US, but it may well get lashed by tail winds if it comes to an EU-US trade war.",
      "How prepared Europe is, really",
      "Trump's bullish style can come as no surprise to allies after his first term in the White House. The real conundrum for Europe now is his unpredictability: How much is bluster and intimidation and how much is a promise of action?",
      "Ian Lesser, vice president at the German Marshall Fund of the United States think tank, believes Trump's tariff threats are real and that Europe is far from ready.",
      "\"They're not prepared, no one really is. This very different approach to global trade upsets many cornerstones of the international economy, which has evolved over decades.\"",
      "The European Commission claims to be ready for any number of moves by Trump when he returns to the White House. It is a huge trade power on the world stage. But Mr Lesser says the biggest impact on Europe could come if Trump launches an aggressive trade war against China. That could result in supply chain disruptions for Europe and Beijing dumping even more cheap products on European markets, to the detriment of local businesses.",
      "\"For Europe it's double exposure: exposure to what America might do and then what China will do in response.\"",
      "Trade, defence and the Musk factor",
      "What complicates things further is that trade and defence aren't separate issues for Trump and his administration. He recently refused to rule out economic and/or military action against EU and Nato member Denmark if it didn't hand over the autonomous territory Greenland to the US.",
      "And Trump's incoming vice president appeared, this autumn, to make US defence of Europe conditional on EU regulatory bodies stepping away from the social platform X.",
      "JD Vance warned the US could pull its support for Nato if the EU continued a longstanding investigation into X, which is owned by Trump's Golden Boy, Elon Musk.",
      "Recently, Mr Musk also displayed a keenness for taking sides in European politics. He launched repeated online attacks against centre-left European leaders Sir Keir Starmer in the UK and outgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Musk posted on X that the extreme anti-migration AfD party was Germany's only hope.",
      "This shocked many in Europe but pollsters suggest Mr Musk's controversial posts have little actual influence on European public opinion.",
      "Trump and Mr Musk are widely distrusted in Europe, as clearly illustrated in a new poll commissioned by the European Council of Foreign Relations, entitled The EU and global public opinion after the US elections.",
      "From ego flattering to flashing cash",
      "In the end, different European leaders have different approaches to \"Taming the Trump,\" as insiders describe attempts. Some flatter his not-exactly-tiny ego.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is the expert here. He was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Trump on social media after his re-election in November and he swiftly invited him to attend the glittering and dignitary-resplendent re-opening of the Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.",
      "When he was first in the White House, President Macron wowed Trump as guest of honour at the annual display of pomp and military might of Bastille Day in Paris.",
      "The UK, meanwhile, knows Trump has a soft spot for Scotland, where his mother comes from, and for the British Royal Family. He visibly relished attending a state banquet with the now-late Queen Elizabeth II in 2019. He heaped praise on Prince William after sitting down with him this autumn.",
      "Others in Europe favour flashing the cash.",
      "European Central Bank (ECB) chief, Christine Lagarde, has advised Europe's leaders to adopt a \"cheque-book strategy\" and negotiate with Trump rather than retaliate against his proposed tariffs.",
      "Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, speaks of buying more (expensive) US liquified natural gas (LNG) as part of Europe's effort to diversify its energy supplies. It has been weaning itself off a reliance on cheap Russian gas since the Kremlin launched its large-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Sources in the Commission also speak of possibly buying more US agricultural products and weapons.",
      "Should Europe be more self-sufficient?",
      "Macron, meanwhile, has long advocated what he calls \"strategic autonomy\" - essentially Europe learning to be more self-sufficient, in order to survive.",
      "\"Europe... can die and that depends entirely on our choices,\" he said this spring.",
      "Covid showed Europe how dependent it was on Chinese imports, like medicines. Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine exposed Europe's over-reliance on Russian energy.",
      "Macron is now sounding the alarm about the US: \"The United States of America has two priorities. The USA first, and that is legitimate, and the China issue, second. And the European issue is not a geopolitical priority for the coming years and decades.\"",
      "Trump's return to the White House is making European leaders think about continental weaknesses.",
      "The big question around defence",
      "When it comes to defence, Trump's insistence that Europe spend more is generally accepted (though how much more is a hot topic of debate). But where Trump talks in terms of increasing GDP spending, Europeans are discussing how to spend their defence budgets more wisely and in a more joined-up way to boost continental safety.",
      "Emmanuel Macron wants an EU-wide industrial defence policy. He says the war in Ukraine illustrated that \"our fragmentation is a weakness... We have sometimes discovered ourselves, as Europeans, that our guns were not of the same calibre, that our missiles did not match.\"",
      "Europe frets that Trump will not want to continue being the main sponsor of military aid to Ukraine as was the case under the Biden administration.",
      "Next month, EU leaders have invited the UK - one of Europe's two big military powers - to an informal summit to discuss working together better on security and defence.",
      "The EU's defence chief and former Estonian prime minister, Kaja Kallas, believes European unity of purpose is needed. \"We need to act in a united way. Then, we are strong. Then, we are also serious on the world stage.\"",
      "Weaker and more fractured? Europe today",
      "There are analysts who say Europe is in a far weaker, more fractured state to deal with Trump 2.0 than it was in 2016 when he was first elected. I'd say the answer to that is yes. But also no.",
      "Yes - as discussed, economic growth is sluggish and politics are volatile.",
      "Populist nationalist eurosceptic parties are gaining strength in many European countries. Some, like Germany's AfD, are soft on Moscow - while others like Italian PM Giorgia Meloni may be tempted to prioritise transatlantic ties with Trump rather than European unity.",
      "But beware of looking back at Europe when Trump was first elected president through rose-tinted spectacles.",
      "Financially, northern Europe was definitely doing better than it is now, but, in terms of unity, the continent was deeply divided on the back of the migrant crisis in 2015. Populist eurosceptic parties were also on the rise then and, following the Brexit vote in June 2016, there were widespread predictions the EU would soon lose other member countries and fall apart altogether.",
      "Fast forward to 2025 and the EU has weathered Brexit, the Covid pandemic, the migration crisis and Trump's first term in office - and countries very much pulled together after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It was more of a stumbling, rather than sailing through these successive crises, but the EU is still standing and the wounds of Brexit, for example, have healed with time.",
      "Post-Brexit UK is seen by the EU as a close ally that shares the same values in a world threatened by an ambitious China, an expansionist Russia and an unpredictable, bullish incoming US president.",
      "Nato, meanwhile, though worried about Trump's commitment to the alliance, has been boosted militarily and geostrategically by Sweden and Russian neighbour Finland becoming members following the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Maybe, just maybe, Trump will see fewer differences that frustrate and antagonise him about Europe this time round.",
      "It's a Europe that recognises the need to spend more on defence, as he demands; that is far warier of China, as he expects, and that is more right-leaning in its politics, as he prefers.",
      "Is it a Europe whose leaders also stand up to Trump, despite threats and bluster, if they feel he crosses a line - be it over human rights, free speech or dallying with dictators?",
      "The next chapter in relations between transatlantic frenemies waits to be written.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 02:56:50 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump's inaugural speech was a mix of promises \u2013 and contradictions \u2013 that underlined some of the challenges he faces upon his return.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump, who rode back into power on a wave of voter dissatisfaction with the status quo, promised a new \"golden age\" for America in his inaugural address.",
      "The speech was a mix of promises \u2013 and contradictions \u2013 that underlined some of the opportunities and challenges the new president will face in his second term in office.",
      "He started talking at a little after noon on Monday, and it seemed at times like he didn't stop talking \u2013 at ad-libbed remarks later at the Capitol, at his indoor parade rally at a downtown sports arena and at the White House executive order signing \u2013 until well into the evening.",
      "Through it all, Trump demonstrated the kind of dramatic flair and penchant for controversy and confrontation that has energised his supporters and infuriated his critics.",
      "During his inaugural address, Trump paid particular attention to immigration and the economy \u2013 issues that polls suggest American voters cared about most last year. He also promised to end government-promoted diversity programmes and noted that US official policy would only recognise two genders, male and female.",
      "That last line generated an enthusiastic response at the Capitol and wild cheers from his crowd of supporters gathered at a nearby sport arena. It's a sign that cultural issues - where he drew the most vivid contrasts with Democrats in last year's election - will continue to be one of Trump's most powerful ways the new president connects with his base.",
      "Before he outlined what this new age would entail, however, Trump painted a dark picture of the current American political climate.",
      "LIVE - latest updates and analysis",
      "LIVE - latest updates and analysis",
      "As his predecessor, Joe Biden, and other Democrats sat stone-faced to one side, Trump said the government faces a \"crisis of trust\". He condemned the \"vicious, violent and unfair weaponisation\" of the US Justice Department, which had investigated and attempted to prosecute him for contesting the 2020 election results.",
      "He claimed a mandate to reverse \"horrible betrayals\" and lashed out at a \"radical and corrupt establishment\" that he said extracted power and wealth from America's citizens.",
      "It was the kind of populist, anti-elite rhetoric that has been a staple of Trump's speeches for a decade. Unlike when Trump first began his ascent to the pinnacles of US political power in 2015, however, Trump represents the current emerging establishment as much as any one man. And sitting behind him on the dais were a collection of some of the wealthiest, and most influential, corporate leaders in the world.",
      "On the day of his inauguration, Trump has the attention \u2013 and the initiative. His aides have promised hundreds of executive actions \u2013 on a range of subjects, including immigration, energy, trade, education and hot-button cultural issues.",
      "In his inaugural address, he detailed a handful of them. He pledged to declare national emergencies on energy and immigration, allowing him to put the US military on the border, drastically limit the rights of asylum-seekers and reopen large swaths of federal land to energy extraction. He repeated his pledge to change the name of Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" and to take back the Panama Canal.",
      "He made an unfounded claim that China was running the key waterway and said that US ships, including naval vessels, were paying too much in transit fees \u2013 perhaps a hint at the real objective in future negotiations with the Panamanian government.",
      "\"The US will once again consider itself a growing nation,\" he said, pledging to increase American wealth and expand \"our territory\".",
      "That last bit might catch the ear of US allies, who have already been concerned by Trump's interest in acquiring Greenland and quips about making Canada the 51st US state.",
      "On the campaign trail, and in this speech, Trump made a series of big promises. Now that he is president, he will be challenged to deliver \u2013 and show what the \"golden age\" he heralds actually means.",
      "After Trump concluded his speech and saw Biden depart via a Marine helicopter, he gave off-the-cuff remarks at a gathering of supporters elsewhere in the Capitol. It was there that the more unscripted Trump \u2013 the one who frequently generates headlines and turns American politics on its head \u2013 reemerged.",
      "The 2020 election was \"rigged\", he said. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was criminally responsible for the 6 January, 2021 attack on the US Capitol. He boasted about the size of his 2024 election victory and said he grudgingly agreed to talk about \"unity\" in his inaugural address.",
      "It was just a taste of what was in store for the rest of the day \u2013 and for the next four years.",
      "At a signing ceremony in the evening,  Trump took an ordinary presidential act \u2013 rescinding orders from a previous administration of different party \u2013 and turned it into spectacle.",
      "After giving another winding speech \u2013 his third of the day \u2013 Trump moved to a small desk on the stage at the downtown sport arena where his indoor inaugural parade had just concluded. Then he went to work freezing new federal regulations and hiring, reversing Biden administration directives, mandating federal workers work in-office full-time and withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accords.",
      "\"Can you imagine Joe Biden doing this?\" he asked after signing the regulation freeze \u2013 but that applied to the moment as much as the content of the orders.",
      "He also signed more symbolic orders to end the \"weaponisation of government\" and instruct his administration to address the higher cost of living.",
      "After the arena ceremony, Trump tossed the pens he used into the crowd \u2013 another Trumping flourish.",
      "Then he went back to the White House, and executive orders continued \u2013 pardoning nearly all of the 1,600-plus supporters arrested in the 6 January Capitol riot, temporarily suspending the TikTok ban and withdrawing the US from the World Health Organisation.",
      "He also reinterpreted a key constitutional amendment and instructed his administration to cease granting citizenship to US-born children of undocumented migrants.",
      "All the while, he offered a running commentary \u2013 including proposing a 25% tariff on Mexico and Canada starting on 1 February,  accusing Democrats of cheating in the 2020 election and expressing doubt about the Gaza War ceasefire.",
      "Trump returns to power with a team that has a detailed strategy for governing and an aggressive agenda to pursue. Trump himself, however, can still be as unpredictable and unfocused as ever \u2013 making remarks that could represent new policy or just a momentary distraction.",
      "The second Trump era has truly begun.",

      "McGregor has said he agreed to an exhibition boxing match against Logan Paul in India, however the bout is not confirmed.",
      "Last year McGregor lost a civil case where he was accused of raping Nikita Hand in a Dublin hotel in December 2018.",
      "Logan Paul has also recently faced fresh questions over his cryptocurrency dealings amid ongoing concerns he may have profited from misleading fans. Paul denied any wrongdoing.",
      "McGregor was also pictured alongside the head of the Reform UK political party, Nigel Farage, at a Trump rally on Sunday night.",
      "Media names",
      "Podcaster Joe Rogan was also seen in the inauguration crowd.",
      "In 2020, Rogan endorsed Democrat candidate Bernie Sanders but shortly before the 2024 election, he endorsed Trump.",
      "At times, Rogan's editorial approach has landed him in hot water - for example, during the Covid pandemic, when he was accused of spreading vaccine misinformation.",
      "In 2022, Rogan apologised after footage emerged of him repeatedly using the n-word in early episodes of his show.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, chairman emeritus of News Corporation, which owns Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the Sun and the Times, was pictured with his fifth wife Elena Zhukova.",

      "Notable absences",

      "Warning: This story contains details some may find distressing.",
      "In a trembling voice she explains how her home in Omdurman had been raided during Sudan's violent civil war, which erupted in 2023.",

      "But as soon as they crossed the border, Layla says the traffickers held them hostage, beat them and demanded more money.",
      "\"My son needed medical attention after he was hit repeatedly in the face,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "The traffickers released them after three days, without saying why. Layla thought her new life in Libya was starting to get better after the family managed to travel west and she rented a room and started working.",
      "But one day her husband left to look for work and never returned. Then her 19-year-old daughter was raped by a man known to the family through Layla's job.",

      "\"We have barely any food,\" she says, adding that her children are not in school. \"My son is afraid to leave the house as other children often beat him and insult him for being black. I feel like I'm going to lose my mind.\"",

We contacted them through a researcher in migration and asylum seeker issues in Libya.",

      "They decided to move to Libya, but what was awaiting them there was a \"living hell\", Salma says.",
      "She describes how, as soon as they crossed the border, they were placed in a warehouse run by traffickers. The men wanted money that had been paid in advance to traffickers on the Egyptian side of the border, but it never arrived.",
      "Her family spent nearly two months in the warehouse. At one point, Salma was separated from her husband and taken to a room for women and children. Here, she says she and her two eldest children were subjected to various forms of brutality because they wanted the money.",
      "\"Their whips left marks on our bodies. They would beat my daughter and put my son's hands in a lit oven while I was watching.",
      "\"Sometimes I wished we would all die together. I could think of no other way out.\"",
      "Salma says her son and daughter were traumatised by the experience and have suffered from incontinence since. She then lowers her voice.",
      "\"They would take me to a separate room, the 'rape room' with different men each time,\" she says. \"I bear the child of one of them.\"",
      "Eventually, she raised some money through a friend in Egypt and the traffickers released the family.",
      "She says a doctor then told her it was too late for an abortion, and when her husband found out she was pregnant he abandoned her and the children, leaving them to sleep rough, eating leftovers from rubbish bins and begging in the street.",
      "They found refuge on a remote farm in north-western Libya for a while, spending whole days with little to no food. They quenched their thirst by drinking contaminated water from a nearby well.",
      "\"It breaks my heart to hear my [older] son saying he is literally dying from hunger,\" Salma says over the phone, as the cries of her baby grow louder in the background.",
      "\"He is so hungry,\" she says, \"but I have nothing, not even enough milk in my breasts to feed him.\"",
      "Jamila, a Sudanese woman in her mid-40s, also believed reports within the Sudanese community that a better life awaited them in Libya.",
      "She fled previous unrest in Sudan's western region of Darfur in 2014 and spent years in Egypt before moving to Libya in late 2023. She says her daughters have been raped repeatedly since then - they were 19 and 20 when it first happened.",
      "\"I sent them for a cleaning job while I was ill; they came back at night covered with dirt and blood - four men raped them until one of them fainted,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Jamila says she was also raped and held captive for weeks by a man, much younger than her, who had offered her a job cleaning his house.",
      "\"He used to call me a 'disgusting black'. He raped me and said, 'This is what women were made for,'\" she recalls.",
      "\"Even kids here are mean to us, they treat us as beasts and sorcerers, they insult us for being black and African, are they not Africans themselves?\" Jamila says.",
      "When her daughters were raped the first time, Jamila took them to hospital and reported it to police. But when the police officer realised they were refugees, Jamila says he withdrew the report and warned her that she would be jailed if the complaint was officially filed. This was in the west of Libya.",
      "Libya is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or the 1967 protocol relating to the Status of Refugees - and considers refugees and asylum-seekers \"illegal migrants\".",
      "The country is divided into two, with each part run by a different government, but the situation is easier for migrants in the east as they can file official complaints without being detained, and access healthcare more easily, according to human rights group Libya Crimes Watch.",
      "While sexual violence is common within unofficial facilities run by traffickers, there is also evidence that abuse is happening in official detention centres in Libya, especially in the west.",
      "Hanaa, a Sudanese woman who works gathering plastic bottles from bins to feed her children, says she was abducted in western Libya and taken to a forest and raped at gunpoint by a group of men.",
      "The next day her attackers took her to a facility run by the state-funded Stability Support Authority (SSA). Nobody told Hanaa why she had been detained.",
      "\"Young men and boys were beaten and forced to completely remove their clothes while I was watching,\" Hanaa tells the BBC.",
      "\"I was there for days. I slept on the bare floor, resting my head on my plastic slippers. They would let me go to the toilet after hours of begging. I was repeatedly beaten on the head.\"",
      "There have been numerous previous reports of migrants from other African countries being abused in Libya. The country is a key stepping stone on the way to Europe, although none of the women the BBC spoke to planned to travel there.",
      "In 2022, Amnesty International accused the SSA of \"unlawful killings, arbitrary detentions, interception and subsequent arbitrary detention of migrants and refugees, torture, forced labour, and other shocking human rights violations and crimes under international law\".",
      "The report states that Ministry of Interior officials in the capital, Tripoli, told Amnesty that the ministry had no oversight over the SSA since it answers to the prime minister, Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh, whose office did not respond to our request for comment.",
      "Libya Crimes Watch has told the BBC that systemic sexual abuse of migrants takes place in official migrant detention centres, including the notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli.",
      "In a 2023 report, M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) said there was an \"increasing number of reports of sexual and physical violence, including systematic strip and intimate body searches and rape\" at Abu Salim.",
      "The interior affairs minister and the Department for Combating Illegal Migration in Tripoli did not respond to our request for comment.",
      "Salma has now left the farm moved into a new room with another family nearby, but she and her family still face the threat of eviction and abuse.",
      "She says she cannot go back home because of what happened to her.",
      "\"I bring shame on the family, they would say. I'm not sure they would even welcome my dead body,\" she says. \"If only I had known what was awaiting me here.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 22 Jan 2025 00:07:09 GMT",
    "summary": "The Lose Control singer talks about masculine role models, becoming a father, and facing prejudice.",
    "story": [
      "When Teddy Swims turned up to the  MTV Awards last September, he was nominated for four prizes, including best new artist.",
      "In the event, the combined forces of Chappell Roan and Sabrina Carpenter denied him a single Moon Man trophy \u2013 but the singer left with something much more valuable.",
      "\"I didn't realise until a couple of weeks later, but my partner and I conceived that night,\" he beams.",
      "\"We're due in June and things are great. I think we're gonna crush it.\"",
      "Domestic bliss isn't a quality that fans might associate with Teddy Swims.",
      "His huge breakthrough single Lose Control, and the hit album I've Tried Everything But Therapy, were rooted in dysfunction, addiction and heartbreak.",
      "They were inspired by a toxic, mutually-destructive relationship he'd escaped. In the past, he's described it as a \"really co-dependent lifestyle\" that went from \"bender to bender\" as both sides \"leveraged each other's shame against one another\".",
      "As he sings on a recent single, \"I saved my life when I showed you the door\".",
      "But that was only one chapter in the story of the 32-year-old Georgia native Jaten Dimsdale.",
      "This Friday, he releases a second album, I've Tried Everything But Therapy Part 2, that explains what happened next.",
      "\"I've learned that love doesn't have to be this thing of high highs and low lows \u2013 fighting and pulling teeth just to stay together,\" he says.",
      "\"The first album was a lot of turmoil, and not too much closure. So I wanted to come back and say, 'Here's me on the other side of this, and I'm doing better'.",
      "\"I feel like, as a listener, I would want to hear that there's a way out.\"",
      "His new partner is also a singer-songwriter, Raiche Wright, who he met \"a couple of Thanksgivings ago\" when she came to one of his shows - and the new album dwells in a sort of bewildered bliss.",
      "\"Are you something from a dream or something that I made up?\" he wonders on the slick R&B groove of Are You Real.",
      "Later, on the acoustic guitar ballad If You Ever Change Your Mind, he croons, \"I love you, I love you,\" with a quiet sincerity rarely found in a pop record.",
      "Musically, the album paints from the same palette as before \u2013 a brand of 1960s soul where dusty piano grooves and chugging guitar lines are punched up with a modern pop sheen, and a pinch of rock and roll swagger.",
      "But it's not all hearts and flowers. The sumptuous soul of Black And White makes a plea for tolerance, inspired by the prejudice Dimsdale and his partner \u2013 who has mixed black and white heritage \u2013 have faced.",
      "\"I see people looking disgusted because we're different colours \u2013 especially down South,\" he says.",
      "\"But it's okay to be happy in love with someone of a different colour, or a different size or shape, or the same sex, or whatever it is.",
      "\"Why would you be hating on that? It's such a backwards thing.\"",
      "Dimsdale learned about acceptance the hard way. Born in Conyers, an eastern suburb of Atlanta, his grandfather was a Pentecostal preacher with set views on the world, and family life was hard to navigate.",
      "His parents divorced when he was three and, although both remarried, their new relationships were problematic. His mother, with whom he lived, married an alcoholic who left suddenly when Dinsdale was 18 and never spoke to the family again.",
      "His father, who he saw at weekends, married a woman who developed serious mental health problems, including schizophrenia, and spent long stretches in hospital. His dad ended up raising Dimsdale's step-brothers almost single-handedly.",
      "\"He'd work 18 hours a day, and still get the homework done and still get to the practices, all by himself,\" he says.",
      "\"There's just not enough I can say about how amazing that man truly is.\"",
      "Dimsdale was a late bloomer when it came to music. As a youngster, he was a dedicated footballer, until a friend convinced him to audition for a school production of Damn Yankees.",
      "The musical sparked a love affair with singing. He researched vocal techniques on YouTube, soaking in performances by Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson and Aretha Franklin.",
      "After graduation, he started playing with local metal bands, adopting the stage name \"Swims\" from internet forum-speak for Someone Who Isn't Me Sometimes. Teddy, meanwhile, is a childhood nickname, based on his affable and cuddly persona.",
      "Old-fashioned success",
      "But it was a cover of Shania Twain's country ballad You're Still The One that earned him his big break.",
      "On YouTube, it's been watched 197 million times. One of those viewers was a talent scout for Warner Bros records, who signed Dimsdale to a record deal on Christmas Eve 2019.",
      "They partnered the musician with professional writers like Julian Bunetta (Sabrina Carpenter, One Direction) and Mikky Ekko (Rihanna, Drake) \u2013 but he also retained his high school band, Freak Feely, who play with him to this day.",
      "After three EPs, and hundreds of sessions, they wrote Lose Control, and Dinsdale instantly \"knew it was going to change my life\".",
      "He was right. With 2.2 billion global streams, it is one of the most successful songs in recent chart history - but finding an audience took time.",
      "There was no viral moment or TikTok trend associated with Lose Control. Instead, Dimsdale \"did it the old-fashioned way\".",
      "\"We showed up and did every damn interview possible,\" he says. \"We went to every office and radio station and shook every hand individually. We stopped everyone on the street, busking.\"",
      "He believes the personal touch beats everything, hands down.",
      "\"People love to see their friend win, so if you go out there and make time for them, it goes a lot further than a playlist coming across your desk, or a little file coming to your email that says, 'Hey, can you push this song?'",
      "\"And that's the old way you work a record, before streaming.\"",
      "Bashfully, he confesses the song made him a millionaire (\"so I can't be too mad at that girl any more, can I?\") but he's learning that making money means spending money.",
      "\"A million dollars goes so fast,\" he says. \"Once you put 66 people on a tour, with all the gear and all the lights, it's right out the door as fast as you get it.",
      "\"Twenty bucks still means what 20 bucks meant to me before, but the amount coming in and out is such a scary thing to look at sometimes.\"",
      "As we speak, he's in rehearsals in Pennsylvania, ahead of his first European arena tour, which includes two nights at Wembley this March.",
      "The stage has just been built for the first time, and he's eager to acquaint himself with all the ramps and video walls. The music\u2026 not so much.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I'm already sick of the songs, but we've been playing them non-stop for two weeks now,\" he says. \"I can't wait 'til people sing along, so I can fall in love with them again.\"",
      "If you've been to a Teddy Swims show, you'll know he lays his heart on the line.",
      "There are countless videos of him sobbing as he performs Some Things I'll Never Know, a song about abandonment and grief. For the upcoming tour, he's playing it back-to-back with a new tear-jerker, Northern Lights, that dives even deeper into heartbreak.",
      "He's going to be a mess - but Dimsdale insists it's a good thing.",
      "\"Every day I try to cry a little bit,\" he says. \"It's just pain leaving the body.",
      "\"And it's a constant reminder that, whatever you were going through, on the other side of it there's happiness.\"",
      "With his bearded and tattooed face, you might not expect such emotional intelligence \u2013 but Dimsdale's model of masculinity wasn't afraid to share his feelings.",
      "\"I'm my daddy's son,\" he says. \"He's just a sensitive man. He'll tell you he loves you, he'll tell you he's proud of you. Man, I'll still sit there, laying in his arms while we're watching TV on the couch.\"",
      "\"He's the most beautiful, humble human being I've ever met. Second to only Jesus Christ.\"",
      "So, the obvious question: Is dad excited to become a grandfather?",
      "\"He's doing backflips,\" laughs the singer.",
      "\"I'm almost scared to have him as a granddad, because I want my kids to think I'm cool, too.\""

      "Whether NYPD or civilians, the performers are not actors, but they're getting training in performance and improvisation during a 10 week workshop called \"To Protect, Serve and Understand,\" or TPSU.

    "title": "Steve Guttenberg talks the L.A. wildfires, and caring for his hero dad",
    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 11:18:55 -0500",
    "summary": "As the Palisades Fire exploded in his hometown, the actor was moving abandoned cars so emergency vehicles could get through. He spoke about the importance of making a difference; and about caring for his late father, Stanley, whom he calls his \"anchor.\"",
    "story": [
      "On January 7, as the Palisades Fire exploded, a man interrupted a reporter's live shot. It was Steve Guttenberg, one of the biggest movie stars of the 1980s and '90s. He had been moving cars \u2013 abandoned by people around Pacific Palisades trying to escape the encroaching fire \u2013 so that emergency vehicles could get through.",
      "\"What's happening is, people take their keys with them as if they're in a parking lot. This is not a parking lot,\" he told KTLA. \"If you leave your car behind, leave the key in there so a guy like me can move your car so that these fire trucks can get up there.\"",
      "He can't remember how he got to safety.",
      "Many days later, with much of his hometown reduced to ruins, he was still there to help protect his and his neighbors' homes. He showed me a part of Sunset that had been stacked with cars. \"Yeah, couldn't get through,\" he said. \"So, I was moving some of these cars over there. And then, a lotta these cars just didn't have keys in them. Locked.\"",
      "I asked, \"What is it in you that is compelling you to stay here?\"",
      "\"You know, it's not often in life that you feel like you can make a difference,\" he replied. \"And I really feel like I can make a difference. Like, I'm able bodied, I'm strong, I have a heart, and I care. And this is what I'm supposed to do today.\"",
      "If you know Guttenberg, you know he's a helper. Seven years ago, he put everything on hold to care for someone with whom he was deeply in love: his father.",
      "I noted, \"I'm gonna try to get through this interview without crying because I lost my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg asked, \"What was your dad's name?\"",
      "\"Douglas.\"",
      "\"Hi, Douglas!\" Guttenberg said. \"You know, when you say a person's name who's passed, they come around. I believe they're not always with you, 'cause they've got other things to do. But Douglas is here, and so is Stanley, my dad.",
      "\"My dad was the greatest,\" he said. \"He was the first man who ever held me, first guy I ever looked in his eyes. And I fell in love with my dad.\"",
      "Guttenberg has written a book about his journey as a caregiver for the man he calls his hero. It's called \"Time to Thank.\" \"My dad and his dad weren't close,\" he said. \"My grandfather was cold. He wasn't a kissing, hugging type of dad to my father. So, my dad was the opposite.\"",
      "A \"kissing and hugging dad\" who worked jobs that weren't exactly touchy-feely. \"He was an Airborne Army Ranger. He was a New York City policeman. He was a power lifter and a weightlifter. And he did handstands for 20 minutes.\"",
      "Guttenberg's dad was a hands-on parent, so it was to Steve's surprise that when he wanted to move to L.A., at only 17, to try to become a movie star, he was allowed to do it. \"My parents gave me $300 and said, 'You got two weeks.' And I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial. And my parents let me stay another two weeks. And I got a little movie [\"The Chicken Chronicles\"]. And I got more commercials. Then, I actually stayed a year, before I quit and went back to school.\"",
      "He wasn't in school for long when Hollywood beckoned him back. \"I was at a party in my suite at Albany State, and got this call from my agent. Everybody was a little \u2026 inebriated!\" he laughed. \"And my agent said, 'I got an audition for you. It was called \"Boys From Brazil.\" And it was gonna be starring Greg Peck and Larry Olivier and James Mason, Uta Hagen.'\"",
      "\"It's hard to turn that down, right?\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! I asked my dad. My dad said, 'You know, just go down and do the audition. if you get it, you'll decide. And I got the job.\"",
      "Guttenberg says it was Laurence Olivier who taught him humility, but it was his dad who helped him get his big break in a little film about a bunch of misfits joining the police force. \"I told my dad that I had a screen test coming up for this movie, 'Police Academy.' And he said, 'Oh, you should wear my police academy shirt.' I remember going to the screen test, and I was up against another actor who was really talented,. And the director said, 'Hold on here: Did you make that shirt, boy?' And I said, 'No, that's my dad's real police academy shirt.' And half a day later my agent called me and said, 'You got it.' And maybe it was because of that cadet shirt that my dad gave me.\"",
      "Guttenberg would go on to become one of the busiest actors of his generation, with more than 100 films and TV shows under his belt, including \"Diner,\" \"Three Men and a Baby, \"Cocoon,\" and \"Short Circuit.\" All the while his dad was there ready to bring him back to reality, often calling before the rest of L.A. got out of bed. Guttenberg says he never missed that 6:00 a.m. call.\u00a0 \"No, I always had to be home at six o'clock. Even if I got home at 5 to 6:00! I had to answer that phone. He was my anchor.\"",
      "So when his dad was diagnosed with kidney failure while living in Phoenix, Guttenberg got in his car, driving 400 miles every week to care for his father. \"The drive really gave me time to think, and time to thank,\" he said.",
      "Steve and his siblings even become home dialysis techs, but only he couldn't accept the inevitable. \"I gave him a hug. And something didn't sound right. And we had a nurse with us, and the nurse put a stethoscope to him. And she said, 'He's gone.' And I said, 'No!' And I started doing CPR on him. I just couldn't accept it at that moment.\"",
      "Asked when he could finally let him go, Guttenberg replied, \"I probably let him go a year later. It's hard to believe that he's gone. I still think that he's here.\"",
      "\"He is,\" I said. \"Just say his name.\"",
      "\"Stanley!\"",
      "And right now, Guttenberg thinks his father is sending along some helpful advice. \"I feel my dad's around, yeah, I really do. I feel my dad is here with me. And I think he's also saying, 'Steven, enough. Get outta there.'\"",
      "So far, his own home is standing. But Steve Guttenberg says it's time to listen to his dad. \"You know, the truth is, no matter how big your house is, no matter how much money you have, how expensive your car, at the end of it, you're walking down the street with a little suitcase of a few things that you saved, and you're looking for someone to tell you where to go.\"",

      "It was the tail end of June 1968; the air was starting to get humid. Fourth grade was ending, and I could feel the three months of delirium that was coming.",
      "And I was ready. Because I'd been collecting. I had enough fireworks to last the whole summer. I took every penny I made from my Newsday delivery route and poured them into \"belts,\" these macho configurations of 144 firecrackers. These particular belts came straight from China, with Chinese calligraphy on the wrapper, and to my young perspective, they were the ultimate asset. Better than gold.",
      "I bought belt after belt from Andy Mahoney, who was notorious in my neighborhood for lighting my neighbor's garage on fire with a chlorine bomb. He was an anti-hero, a rebel with a cause, five years older than I was. The only reason he talked with me was because I was buying from him.",
      "Initially I kept all that gunpowder in the ingenious hideaway I'd devised: the side drawer of my desk. By some miracle, my mother never found them. But they couldn't just sit in that drawer forever; I had to see if they would work.",
      "So I decided to get a pack of matches, lock myself in the family bathroom, and throw lit firecrackers out the only window. My father was down in the den, my mother in the kitchen. How could I possibly get caught? I proceeded to create my own personal preview of the Fourth of July.",
      "And wouldn't you know it? Someone noticed.",
      "\"What the hell is going on?\" I heard my mother say downstairs. \"Stanley, I smell smoke.\"",
      "\"Check the air conditioners,\" my father said. \"I'm going to look at the attic.\"",
      "I heard my father's footsteps as he rushed up to the attic, praying that he would skip past the bathroom I'd turned into my private gunpowder studio. But then he started banging on the door.",
      "\"Steven? What the hell are you doing in there?\"",
      "\"Nothing,\" I said, my voice extremely calm.",
      "I dropped another lit belt out the window.",
      "\"Open this door, now!\"",
      "I looked around the family bathroom: Where could I hide these suckers? Where could I hide myself? Nowhere seemed promising. So, after a moment, I opened the door.",
      "A plume of smoke billowed out into the rest of the house. I was covered in soot. My father looked me over, and as he stood there for what felt like a very long time, I was sure he was going to hand me my head. And not on a platter.",
      "\"I'll tell you what I'm going to do,\" he said. I started to sweat. \"How many firecrackers do you have?\"",
      "I went to my trusty desk drawer and slid it open. He was the only human to ever see that cache\u2014other than Andy Mahoney.",
      "\"That's a lot of gunpowder. How did you get all these firecrackers?\"",
      "\"They're called belts, Dad,\" I said. He raised his eyebrows\u2014not the right answer. \"I got them using my newspaper route money.\"",
      "He reached into the drawer and, with one giant hand, grabbed the bulk of them.",
      "\"Follow me.\"",
      "We headed outside. I was sure that we were going to the garbage pails, but he walked right past them.",
      "\"You and me are going to light every firecracker in these belts and finish them off.\"",
      "I was going to light firecrackers with my father? These were contraband, but he\u2014an ex-cop\u2014was willing to put himself in harm's way for me? That's a dad. That's a father.",
      "We stood on the patio, and as the sun started to set, we handed each other single cylinders of gunpowder. My father had his Zippo lighter\u2014he lit each one carefully and then threw it onto the lawn. Pow! Bang! My dad was lighting firecrackers, and it made me delirious. I carefully twisted a cracker off the belt, handed it to my dad, barrel first, and within seconds it had exploded into a green cloud of smithereens.",
      "Then my father started to get creative\u2014he'd light the firecrackers and then throw them high so they'd explode in mid-air, nipping the edge of the mimosa tree. After a time, he turned to me.",
      "\"Here, you light some,\" he said. \"I've got an extra Zippo.\"",
      "I started slow, lighting the wick and then running as I dropped them on the ground. But I saw my father's confidence and started to throw them onto the lawn too. Dad threw one. I threw one. Our explosions echoing one another: call and response, question and answer.",
      "\"What the hell are you two doing?\" my mother said, her head halfway out the bedroom window.",
      "\"We're lighting firecrackers, Ann. My partner and me.\"",
      "His partner. Dad called me his partner. It was like I'd joined the Yankees and the Mets all at once.",
      "There we stood, for hours, as the sun set over the mimosa tree. I looked up at my dad: my hero, my partner. We lit every last one. Of course, one blew up between my fingers; the pain was spectacular, but I didn't dare tell. This was too good.",
      "It was dark as we lit the last few. They unwrapped and exploded in the air, illuminating the backyard with blasts of light.",
      "\"That's it, Steven. We're done. Good job.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 09:26:12 -0500",
    "summary": "A giant of early 20th century art, whose glamorous figurative paintings of women played an important role in defining Art Deco, is now the subject of her first-ever U.S. retrospective, currently at the de Young Museum of San Francisco.",
    "story": [
      "When you see a painting by Tamara de Lempicka, it's hard to resist leaning in for a closer look. \"It's just exquisite,\" said Furio Rinaldi, one of the curators of the first-ever Lempicka retrospective in the United States. \"You don't see the brush strokes. They are just polished and incredibly deliberate. It's such a clean way of painting.\"",
      "These glamorous Art Deco works are now on display at the de Young Museum in San Francisco. [The exhibit travels to Houston this spring.]",
      "So, what makes a painting so characteristically Lempicka?",
      "\"Geometrical shapes,\" said Rinaldi. \"Everything is reduced to essential forms. And the other aspect of Lempicka is that she sourced directly from examples provided by the European Old Masters. So, all these things blended together create a language that not only is entirely unique, but entirely modern.\"",
      "Born in 1894 in Poland as Tamara Rosa Hurwitz, Tamara eventually moved to St. Petersburg, marrying an aristocratic lawyer, Tadeusz \u0141empicki Junosza. In 1917, the Russian Revolution forced the couple and their young daughter to flee to Paris. \"Paris was just recovering from the end of the first war,\" said Rinaldi. \"And there was a sense of hope for the future, and kind of a great faith for what was to come.\"",
      "In Paris, she began to paint, first out of financial necessity, using the name Lempicka.",
      "Rinaldi said, \"She captured that very exciting moment of empowerment and emancipation for the queer community in Paris.\"",
      "Some of the women she painted were her lovers. \"The female body is not concealed or corseted as it was before in the previous decade,\" said Rinaldi. \"It's celebrated in its shape.\"",
      "He described a painting of her lover, the poet Ira Perrot: \"Eroticism with a sitter who's not even looking at us. She's just living in her own world. She has this gaze that is detached and completely cool.\"",
      "Each time Lempicka sold a painting, she made a purchase of her own: a diamond bracelet. According to Marisa de Lempicka, the artist's great-granddaughter, it was for protection: \"If she ever had to flee again, she could carry the bracelets with her. She could survive again.\"",
      "\"She always had to think about saving herself?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, herself and her family.\"",
      "Indeed, her fears were well-founded. In 1939, before the outbreak of World War II, Lempicka and her second husband, a Jewish baron, fled Europe for the United States. She continued painting another four decades, until her death in 1980.",
      "Asked if her great-grandmother had a sense of her legacy at the end of her life, Marisa de Lempicka replied, \"She was the toast of the town in the Twenties and Thirties in Paris. She was extremely well-known. And then, she moved to the United States and, you know, the tastes changed. Abstract expressionism is in fashion, so she kind of falls out of favor.\"",
      "\"Why do you think we haven't known her name and her story?\"",
      "\"I think the fact she's a woman artist,\" Marisa said. \"How many women artists can we name? You go to the general public? Very, very few.\"",
      "But Lempicka is now back in the public eye. Last year, she was the subject of a Broadway show, and her works continue to sell for millions of dollars. Collectors include Barbra Streisand and Madonna, who's even featured Lempicka's paintings in music videos.",
      "Asked what she wants the public to know about Tamara de Lempicka, Marisa replied, \"I hope people see her art, learn about her life, and feel empowered and inspired to live their own life and their own dreams. I know this is what Tamara would have wanted.\"",

    "title": "If TikTok goes, so will livelihoods: \"We'd have to completely rebuild\"",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:09:47 -0500",
    "summary": "Experts say no other app offers the same financial opportunities as TikTok, while creators fear loss of income if it disappears.",
    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers.

      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "summary": "Justin Baldoni's lawsuit comes after \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively accused him of sexual harassment.",
    "story": [
      "Justin Baldoni filed a counter lawsuit against \"It Ends With Us\" co-star Blake Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, on Thursday, alleging the couple hijacked his film and sought to destroy his livelihood and career.",
      "In the lawsuit's 179-page complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Baldoni accuses Lively and Reynolds of civil extortion, defamation and invasion of privacy.",
      "The lawsuit, which also named Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, and her firm Vision PR Inc., comes shortly after Baldoni filed a separate defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, which first reported Lively's allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni during the film's production.",
      "Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios, his business partner Jamey Heath and two others are also named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds. They're seeking at least $400 million in damages.",
      "A spokesperson from Lively's legal team said Baldoni's counterclaim is a typical tactic abusers use to discredit victims by turning the tables on them. The spokesperson said the DARVO claim \u2014 deny, attack, reverse victim offender \u2014 is a well-documented method often discussed during the Johnny Depp vs. Amber Heard trials.",
      "\"They are trying to shift the narrative to Ms. Lively by falsely claiming that she seized creative control and alienated the cast from Mr. Baldoni,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"The evidence will show that the cast and others had their own negative experiences with Mr. Baldoni and Wayfarer. The evidence will also show that Sony asked Ms. Lively to oversee Sony's cut of the film, which they then selected for distribution and was a resounding success.\"",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney representing Baldoni, told CBS News in a statement the lawsuit details alleged evidence that Lively disseminated \"grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media.\"",
      "\"It is clear based on our own all out willingness to provide all complete text messages, emails, video footage and other documentary evidence that was shared between the parties in real time, that this is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret,\" Freedman said.",
      "Lively in December came forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Baldoni, who also directed and co-financed the film adaption of the 2016\u00a0Colleen Hoover\u00a0novel that explores domestic violence and emotional abuse.",
      "Lively's complaint against Baldoni, Heath and Wayfarer Studios, originally reported by The New York Times, included accusations that, after a meeting in which she and Reynolds addressed alleged \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "\"The allegations against The New York Times in this new lawsuit are meritless and recycled from the equally baseless claims in the suit that was filed against The Times in California,\" a spokesperson for The New York Times said in a statement.",
      "According to The New York Times, Lively's lawsuit also included texts allegedly sent by Baldoni's publicist, Jennifer Abel, to crisis PR specialist Melissa Nathan, both of whom are named as plaintiffs in Baldoni's lawsuit, which say the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and, \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",
      "In Baldoni's countersuit, he claimed that his former publicist, Stephanie Jones, was \"filled with impotent rage\" at him and Abel, who left Jones' company Jonesworks to form her own firm and work for Baldoni.",
      "In turn, Baldoni's lawsuit alleges, Jones colluded with Lively, Reynolds and Sloane to seize Abel's phone and \"mine it for messages that, stripped of context, could be used to concoct a false narrative\" to make it appear that Baldoni was behind negative press coverage and public reactions to Lively.",
      "The new lawsuit says the plaintiffs did not want to file the suit, but that Lively \"has unequivocally left them with no choice, not only to set the record straight in response to Lively's accusations, but also to put the spotlight on the parts of Hollywood that they have dedicated their careers to being the antithesis of.\"",
      "An email seeking comment from Sloane, whose PR company represents both Lively and Reynolds, was not immediately answered.",
      "The two actors are also represented by the WME agency, which dropped Baldoni as a client after Lively filed a legal complaint that was a precursor to her lawsuit, and the Times published its story on the fight surrounding the film.",
      "The surprise hit film has made major waves in Hollywood and led to discussions of the treatment of female actors both on sets and in media.",

    "summary": "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench,\u200b Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith\u200b, Joan Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy.",
    "story": [
      "Award-winning British actor Joan Plowright, who with her late husband Laurence Olivier did much to revitalize the U.K.'s theatrical scene in the decades after World War II, has died. She was 95.",
      "In a statement Friday, her family said Plowright died the previous day at Denville Hall, a retirement home for actors in southern England, surrounded by her loved ones.",
      "\"She enjoyed a long and illustrious career across theatre, film and TV over seven decades until blindness made her retire,\" the family said. \"We are so proud of all Joan did and who she was as a loving and deeply inclusive human being.\"",
      "Part of an astonishing generation of British actors, including Judi Dench, Vanessa Redgrave, Eileen Atkins and Maggie Smith, Plowright won a Tony Award, two Golden Globes and nominations for an Oscar and an Emmy. She was made a dame by Queen Elizabeth II in 2004.",
      "From the 1950s to the 1980s, Plowright racked up dozens of stage roles in everything from Anton Chekhov's \"The Seagull\" to William Shakespeare's \"The Merchant of Venice.\" She stunned in Eugene Ionesco's \"The Chairs,\" and George Bernard Shaw's totemic two female roles \"Major Barbara\" and \"Saint Joan.\"",
      "\"I've been very privileged to have such a life,\" Plowright said in a 2010 interview with\u00a0The Actor's Work. \"I mean it's magic and I still feel, when a curtain goes up or the lights come on if there's no curtain, the magic of a beginning of what is going to unfold in front of me.\"",
      "The esteem in which Plowright was held in London was evident with the news that theaters across the West End will dim their lights for two minutes at 7 p.m. on Tuesday in her honor.",
      "Born Joan Ann Plowright in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, her mother ran an amateur drama group and Plowright was involved in the theater from age 3. She was soon spending school vacations at summer sessions of university drama schools. After high school, she studied at the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Manchester, then won a two-year scholarship to the drama school at the Old Vic Theatre in London.",
      "Following her London stage debut in 1954, Plowright became a member of the Royal Court Theatre in 1956 and gained recognition in dramas written by the so-called Angry Young Men, such as John Osborne, who were giving British theater a thorough airing-out. The new, rough-hewn, working-class actors like Albert Finney, Alan Bates and Anthony Hopkins were her peers.",
      "Plowright made her feature film debut with an uncredited turn in American director John Huston's epic adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby Dick\" in 1956, starring Gregory Peck as the obsessed Captain Ahab.",
      "A year later, she co-starred with her future husband Olivier in the original London production of Osborne's \"The Entertainer.\" She played Olivier's daughter in the work and the two reunited for the 1960 film adaptation.",
      "By then, Plowright's marriage to British actor Roger Cage had ended, as had Olivier's 20-year union with Vivien Leigh. Plowright and Olivier were married in Connecticut in 1961, while both were starring on Broadway, he in \"Becket\" and she in \"A Taste of Honey,\" for which she won a Tony.",
      "One love letter Olivier sent summed up his love: \"I sometimes feel such a peacefulness come over me when I think of you, or write to you \u2014 a gentle tenderness and serenity. A feeling devoid of all violence, passion or shattering longing... it makes me go out into the street with a smile on my face and in my heart for everybody.\"",
      "Olivier died in 1989 at the age of 82. After that, Plowright enjoyed a career resurgence at the age of 60, satisfying both upmarket tastes and more commercial fare.",
      "She was in Franco Zeffirelli's version of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's \"Jane Eyre\" in 1996 and the Merchant-Ivory production of \"Surviving Picasso,\" as well as starring as the stalwart nanny in Disney's live-action remake of \"101 Dalmatians\" in 1996 with Glenn Close.",
      "She starred opposite Walter Matthau in the big screen adaptation of the classic comic strip \"Dennis the Menace,\" and made a brief appearance in the Arnold Schwarzenegger self-referencing satire \"Last Action Hero\" in 1993.",
      "Plowright became one of only a handful of actors to win two Golden Globes in the same year, in 1993, when she won the supporting actress TV award for \"Stalin\" and the supporting actress movie award for \"Enchanted April.\" For the latter, which told the story of a group of Britons finding their lives transformed on a vacation to Italy, she received her sole nomination for an Academy Award.",
      "Not all her works were career roses, as with the disastrous \"The Scarlet Letter\" starring Demi Moore and a pilot that went nowhere for a TV series based on \"Driving Miss Daisy.\" An appearance alongside Chevy Chase in the 2011 holiday family comedy \"Goose on the Loose\" didn't rouse critics.",
      "A prominent role in later life was keeper of the Olivier flame \u2014 bestowing awards, defending her husband in the press and curating his letters.",
      "\"That is my choice because I was privileged to live with him,\" she told The Daily Telegraph in 2003. \"When someone who has had such fame and idolatry and worship goes, then there's bound to be a backlash which comes the other way and you get a bit sick of that. Mine was really trying to put things straight.\"",
      "Plowright is survived by her three children \u2014 Tamsin, Richard and Julie-Kate, all actors, and several grandchildren.",

      "\"It is with deep regret that we, his family, announce the passing of the man and the artist, David Lynch,\" a statement posted to Lynch's social media reads. \"We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole.' It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.\"",
      "Lynch, who would have turned 79 on Monday, revealed in August 2024 that he was diagnosed with emphysema, a chronic lung disease, after years of smoking.",
      "Lynch, who was born in Montana in 1946, was a writer, director and painter who studied at the American Film Institute. He first broke into the movie scene in 1977 when he turned his thesis project into his first feature film \"Eraserhead,\" a black-and-white surrealist indie film that quickly gained notoriety as a midnight movie.",
      "\"Eraserhead\" attracted the attention of producer Mel Brooks, who brought Lynch aboard to direct \"The Elephant Man,\" an adaptation of the life and times of the severely deformed Joseph Merrick, telling the younger director, \"You're a crazy man. You're hired.\"",
      "\"The Elephant Man\" earned Lynch his first of three Academy Award nominations for best director, followed by \"Blue Velvet\" in 1986 and \"Mulholland Drive\" in 2001, the latter also earning Lynch a best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival, where he previously earned the festival's top prize \u2014 the Palme d'Or \u2014 for 1990's \"Wild at Heart.\"",
      "Lynch also directed the ill-fated 1984 movie adaptation of Frank Herbert's sci-fi novel \"Dune.\"",
      "But for many, Lynch's most famous contribution to pop culture was his collaboration with Mark Frost on ABC's primetime drama \"Twin Peaks,\"\u00a0 which hooked viewers immediately with its sui generis combination of mystery and quirk, spurring legions to tune in weekly to find out who murdered Laura Palmer, who was played by Sheryl Lee.",
      "The show initially lasted only two seasons in the early '90s and took home three Golden Globe honors in 1991, including Best TV Series and Best Actor for Kyle MacLachlan. In 2017, the show was revisited to widespread critical acclaim in the Showtime limited series \"Twin Peaks: The Return.\"",
      "The style of his films coined the term \"Lynchian,\" referring to the juxtaposition of \"surreal or sinister elements with mundane, everyday environments.\"",
      "In 2019, Lynch received an honorary Academy Award at the Motion Picture Academy's Governors Awards, and in 2012, he received honorary degrees from the American Film Institute.",

      "Uecker also befriended former Brewers owner and MLB commissioner Bud Selig, who initially hired him as a scout. Selig liked to joke about how Uecker's initial scouting report was stained with mashed potatoes and gravy.",
      "Selig eventually brought Uecker to the broadcast booth. Uecker became the voice of the Brewers in 1971, in the second year after the team moved from Seattle.",
      "Uecker remained with the club from that point on and became one of the Brewers' most indelible figures. Brewers manager Craig Counsell grew up in the Milwaukee area and remembered spending summer days throwing a baseball against the roof and catching it while listening to Uecker's broadcasts.",
      "\"There's no single person in this franchise's history who has been as iconic and as important as Bob Uecker,\" said Jeff Levering, a member of the Brewers' broadcast team since 2015.",
      "Even as his celebrity status grew nationwide, Uecker savored the opportunity to continue calling games to fans in his hometown.",
      "\"To be able to do a game each and every day throughout the summer and talk to people every day at 6:30 for a night game, you become part of people's families,\" Uecker once said. \"I know that because I get mail from people that tell me that. That's part of the reward for being here, just to be recognized by the way you talk, the way you describe a game, whatever.\"",
      "Uecker was honored by the Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick award in 2003 and spent nearly 20 minutes keeping the Cooperstown, New York, crowd of about 18,000 in stitches.",
      "\"I still \u2014 and this is not sour grapes by any means \u2014   still think I should have gone in as a player,\" he quipped.",
      "\"Ueck\" got his big break off the field after opening for Don Rickles at Al Hirt's nightclub in Atlanta in 1969. That performance caught Hirt's attention, and the musician set him up to appear on \"The Tonight Show\" with Johnny Carson. He became one of Carson's favorite guests, making more than 100 appearances.",
      "Carson was the one who dubbed Uecker \"Mr. Baseball.\" And the name stuck.",
      "But Uecker's comedy was just a part of his abilities. His warm storytelling and delivery made Uecker a natural to become one of the first color commentators on network TV broadcasts in the 1970s with ABC. In the '90s, he teamed up with Bob Costas and Joe Morgan for the World Series.",
      "From there, Uecker reached most households as one of the Miller Lite All-Stars in popular commercials for the beer brand based out of Milwaukee and Uecker later launched his TV acting career in 1985 on the ABC sitcom \"Mr. Belvedere.\"",
      "Uecker played George Owens during the successful 122-episode run of the series that lasted six years, as the head of the family and sports writer in a home that brings in a butler who struggles to adapt to an American household.",
      "In a bit of casting that kept things pretty close to home, Uecker also played a prominent role in the movies Major League (1989) and Major League II (1994) as crass announcer Harry Doyle for a down-and-out Cleveland Indians franchise that finds a way to become playoff contenders.",
      "\"I'm part of American folklore, I guess,\" Uecker told The Associated Press in 2003. \"But I'm not a Hollywood guy. Baseball and broadcasting are in my blood.\"",
      "His wry description of a badly wayward pitch \u2014   \"Juuuust a bit outside!\" \u2014   in the movie is still often-repeated by announcers and fans at ballparks all over.",
      "Uecker's acting left some to believe he was more about being funny than a serious baseball announcer, but his tenure and observations with the Brewers were spot on, especially when games were tight. Equally enjoyable were games that weren't, when Uecker would tell stories about other major leaguers, his own career and his hobbies as an avid fisherman and golfer.",
      "\"I don't think anyone wants to hear somebody screwing around when you got a good game going,\" Uecker said. \"I think people see 'Major League' and they think Harry Doyle and figure that's what Bob Uecker does. I do that sometimes, I do. But when we've got a good game going, I don't mess around.\"",
      "In his later years, he took a serious approach to his health, swimming daily leading up to heart surgery in April 2010. Very soon after the procedures, doctors said Uecker returned to walking several miles and was ahead in recovery.",
      "Uecker pushed to return to the booth and began calling games again in July, saying he bribed the doctors by allowing them to throw out the first pitch.",
      "\"You talk about all the things Bob has done, he never wanted to leave Milwaukee,\" Selig said. \"Above all, he made himself into a great play-by-play announcer. That's what he did. He's everything to this franchise and loves every minute of it.\"",
      "Uecker's own career provided him most of his material. His former teammates said Uecker would do impressions of other broadcasters on the bus, but Uecker turned the spotlight on himself after his playing career was over.",
      "\"I signed with the Milwaukee Braves for $3,000. That bothered my dad at the time because he didn't have that kind of dough,\" he said. \"But he eventually scraped it up.\"",
      "Another classic: \"When I came up to bat with three men on and two outs in the ninth, I looked in the other team's dugout and they were already in street clothes.\"",
      "Uecker also presided over the stirring ceremony that closed Milwaukee County Stadium in 2000. When the Brewers' new stadium opened as Miller Park in 2001, the team began selling \"Uecker Seats\" high in the upper deck and obstructed for a $1.",
      "The stadium, now known as American Family Field, has two statues in Uecker's honor. There's a statue outside the stadium and another one in the back of Section 422, a nod to the Miller Lite commercial in which he famously said \"I must be in the front row!\" while getting taken to one of the worst seats in the ballpark.",

      "More than a dozen cats have been killed or sickened by bird flu that is spreading in raw food products, the Food and Drug Administration says, prompting a federal probe into how the virus got into the pet food supply chain.",
      "\"The FDA is aware of reports of death or illness associated with uncooked food in 13 domestic cats in eight households, 1 exotic cat in one household, and an unknown number of animals at two sanctuaries for large felids,\" an FDA official said in a statement.",
      "Cases have been in California, Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, the FDA said.",
      "Investigators are now working to trace back the outbreaks, the official said. Testing is underway but could take several weeks to yield results to pin down the source.",
      "It is unclear how the virus spread into pet food. Taxpayers have funded record numbers of poultry being culled in an effort to stem\u00a0bird flu outbreaks, and U.S. officials said this month that farmers are not allowed to use meat from those birds in pet food.",
      "\"Affected flocks that are depopulated as part of USDA's efforts to control H5N1 are not permitted in any food product at all. They are most frequently composted on site, as part of the efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus,\" Eric Deeble, Deputy Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, told reporters last week.",
      "While bird flu has largely spared many of the humans and cows sickened by this past year's outbreaks in the U.S. from death or severe disease, officials have warned that the virus is especially lethal to cats.",
      "In response, the FDA said Friday it would order manufacturers of uncooked cat and dog foods to take steps to curb further spread.",
      "Potential risks of raw pet food",
      "Raw and minimally processed pet foods make up a minority of U.S. pet food sales, but the consulting firm OC&C said\u00a0last year\u00a0that there's been \"rapid growth\" in the market.",
      "The American Animal Hospital Association says it does not endorse feeding pets raw protein food. The group warns that \"overwhelming scientific evidence\" shows it puts animals and the humans around them at risk of disease.",
      "To comply with the new requirements, producers either need to start cooking their products or come up with another way to cut the risk in their food safety plans.",
      "\"As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to significantly minimize or prevent H5N1 transmission through animal food,\" the agency said.",
      "The move also prompted the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to step up oversight of turkey slaughter, after a bird flu strain detected in raw pet food and an infected cat was linked to a turkey flock.",
      "Under the program, APHIS said it would require turkeys to undergo isolation and extra testing in some states before they could be slaughtered.",
      "Health officials in California last year had warned against feeding pets recalled raw milk and a local raw pet food brand, Monarch Raw Pet Food, after a probe of cat deaths. Monarch has disputed the allegation, saying there is \"no credible evidence\" that their products were to blame.",

      "Bird flu outbreaks in poultry and dairy herds",

      "This winter's migration started around a month later than usual, U.S. officials say, delaying when the surge of bird flu began to hit farmers hard.",
      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",
      "Turner said they expect that could lead to the surge in bird flu subsiding a month later, as the amount of virus lingering in the environment from their migration starts to wind down.",
      "\"Now that they are predominantly kind of where they're going to be for the winter, there's a little bit less of that migratory movement and exposure,\" said Turner.",
      "This is on top of ongoing outbreaks from a different strain that spilled over into dairy herds in 2023. That virus has spread back from cows to birds at nearby poultry farms in some cases.",

      "While last year's ruling did not order the Environmental Protection Agency to ban water fluoridation, opponents say it carved out a \"clear legal pathway\" giving the federal government authority to force local governments to stop adding the chemical to the water supply.",
      "Public health experts have long defended fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The American Dental Association said last year that research shows it is a \"safe, beneficial and cost-effective public health measure\" for preventing cavities.",
      "District Court Judge Edward Chen ruled last year that evidence showed fluoride was \"hazardous at dosages that are far too close to fluoride levels in the drinking water of the United States,\" but stopped short of ordering the EPA to ban the practice.",
      "The judge said he only had the authority under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, to direct the EPA to take action against the risk, but not to prescribe the specifics of its response, which could range from a national warning to an outright ban.",
      "\"I'm hopeful that the new administration will use the authority that it has under TSCA to follow the lead of Europe and to implement a nationwide ban on water fluoridation,\" Michael Connett, an attorney for the groups Fluoride Action Network and Food & Water Watch that had sued the EPA, told CBS News.",
      "Attorneys for the federal government did not say what they plan to argue in its appeal. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment on the filing.",

      "Companies say they are working to update their products to comply with the Food and Drug Administration's decision Wednesday to ban the artificial food dye Red 3, after the agency said it was revoking the additive's authorization over concerns it was causing cancer in rats.",
      "While the agency says that studies show the way Red 3 causes cancer in rats does not occur in humans, the law still requires additives that cause cancer in animals to be pulled from the market even if they are not proven to pose a risk to humans as well.",
      "The FDA says that food companies will have until Jan. 15, 2027 to stop using the dye. Drugmakers will have an extra year, until January 2028, to comply with the change.",
      "Which food brands have Red 3 in their products?",
      "Red 3, also known as erythrosine, Acid Red 51 or FD&C Red No. 3, is often used in candy. But other companies also use Red 3 to color a wide variety of products, from drinks to vegetarian meats, and will be forced to rework their recipes.",

      "A Nestl\u00e9 spokesperson said most of their recipes already do not include synthetic colors, including Red 3. For products that still use it, like Nesquik strawberry milk or Toll House Funfetti cookie dough, the spokesperson said they have \"already been actively removing\" the dye.",
      "Some Conagra Brands products, including its Marie Callender's birthday cake pie and Duncan Hines confetti cake mix, list Red 3 as an ingredient. A Conagra spokesperson said they are \"minimally impacted\" by the FDA's ruling, and are \"taking steps to remove it from a limited number\" of their products in time for the rule's deadline.",
      "Seasoning and condiments giant McCormick said it had also \"already begun the process of removing Red 3 prior to the FDA ruling\" on the dye. The spokesperson said McCormick has only \"very limited use of Red 3 in our branded retail products.\" Some of their products still listing Red 3 include vegan imitation bacon chips and Cake Mate red icing.",
      "A spokesperson from Dunkin' Donuts confirmed that some of its vegetarian bacon products contain the dye, but that version of the product is sold only in its 48 kosher locations. None of the company's other locations sell products with the dye.",

      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 15:51:18 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, got a head start on those plans by debuting new his-and-her meme coins \u2014 \u00a0the $Trump and $Melania coins \u2014 over the weekend. As of Monday afternoon, the day of Mr. Trump's inauguration, the two digital currencies were worth a combined $9.5 billion.",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the image of a shiba inu dog. Dogecoin became a favored cryptocurrency of billionaire Elon Musk, who even named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, after it.",
      "Mr. Trump announced his cryptocurrency on Friday night, writing on social media that the coin celebrates \"everything we stand for: WINNING!\" The meme coin is being marketed with a picture of Trump holding a fist up superimposed over the words \"FIGHT FIGHT FIGHT,\" a reference to Trump's response to an assassination attempt at a political rally in July.",
      "On Sunday, Melania Trump announced her own meme coin with a black-and-white photo of the First Lady smiling and with her hands clasped in front of her face, as if in thanks.",
      "The new meme coins are a way for Mr. Trump to leverage his online popularity, drawing his supporters to the project, noted Joe McCann, CEO of digital assets investment firm Asymmetric. The products, like Mr. Trump's social media company, tend to attract individual investors, rather than large U.S. institutional firms, who buy shares as a way to show support for the president.",
      "\"Meme coins largely represent communities on the internet represented by a financial asset \u2014 they're the tokenization of internet culture,\" McCann told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Donald Trump is arguably the most popular person on the internet, so by launching a meme coin, members of his community can further gain proximity to him.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has sought to monetize his name with numerous commercial ventures, ranging from a licensing deal for non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, that earned him $7.2 million, to a\u00a0$59.99 Bible\u00a0that earned him $300,000 in royalties. He's also recently rolled out Trump-branded sneakers, a \"Fight, Fight, Fight\"-branded perfume and watches.",
      "Here's what to know about the Trump coins.",
      "How much are the Donald and Melania Trump meme coins worth?",
      "As of Monday afternoon, the Trump meme coin had a market cap of $8.3 billion, while Melania Trump's cryptocurrency was valued at $1.2 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Mr. Trump's meme coin soared after it debuted, hitting a peak of almost $75 each. But the price has shed about 45% of its value since then, settling at about $40 per coin on Monday afternoon. Still, that represents a surge of more than 400% from its initial price, CoinMarketCap data shows.",
      "Melania Trump's meme coin has had a slightly rockier debut, sinking more than 20% to about $5.40 per coin on Monday.",
      "Are $Trump and $Melania real investments?",
      "The Trump meme coin website says the president's cryptocurrency is meant as an expression of support \u2014 not an investment opportunity.",
      "The Melania site describes the meme coins as \"digital collectibles,\" adding that they \"are not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract or security of any type.\"",
      "Investors typically scrutinize balance sheets and income statements when deciding where to allocate their funds, while currency traders will examine economic factors like trade flow and GDP growth when placing their investments. But relying on these traditional measures don't work with meme coins because they aren't tied to an underlying asset or economy, experts note.",
      "\"Attempting to use traditional financial models to value a meme coin will fail miserably,\" McCann noted. \"Business schools don't teach students how to measure culture, virality or communities.\"",
      "Are meme coins risky?",
      "Meme coins are a highly volatile corner of the crypto sector that often start as a joke and have no intrinsic value, although they can surge in price if enough people are willing to buy them. Because of those dynamics, their prices are prone sudden and extreme swings.",
      "\"Meme coins are some of the most volatile assets on earth and should be treated with caution and care,\" McCann said.",
      "The site selling the $Trump coin warned buyers that its price \"may be extremely volatile and you may experience substantial losses in connection with a sale or other disposition of Trump Memes.\"",
      "Meme coins gained popularity in 2021 and 2022, but some inexperienced investors were unprepared for digital currencies' extreme volatility, noted Nigel Green, CEO of wealth management firm deVere Group, in an email. As a result, he's advising investors to be cautious before putting their money into the Trump meme coins.",
      "How can you buy the Trump and Melania meme coins?",
      "The meme coins are available to buy on an app called Moonshot, which allows people to buy meme coins with Apple Pay, credit or debit card, cryptocurrency, or payment apps like PayPal and Venmo.",
      "The Trump meme coin website notes that all transactions \"ARE FINAL AND NON-REFUNDABLE. We shall have no responsibility or liability for any Trump Memes that are lost, misplaced or inaccessible.\"",
      "What is the cryptocurrency industry's view?",
      "Some crypto enthusiasts hailed the Trump meme coin's release, saying it reflects the president's support for an industry that felt unfairly targeted by the Biden administration. Mr. Trump has promised to usher in crypto-friendly regulations and picked crypto backers for key government positions.",
      "For instance, Mr. Trump has nominated cryptocurrency supporter Paul Atkins to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, reinforcing optimism that the new president will deregulate the sector.",
      "Other cryptocurrencies are gaining in value on anticipation that the second Trump administration will benefit the sector. Bitcoin, for instance, soared more than 50% since the November election, surging to a record peak of $109,241 ahead of Mr. Trump's inauguration ceremony.",

    "story": [
      "A sweeping federal cost-cutting effort led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is facing multiple lawsuits, with the litigation coinciding with President Trump's January\u00a0inauguration.",
      "One suit, filed Monday by a public interest law firm called National Security Counselors, claims DOGE is operating as a federal advisory committee. That puts the initiative in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA, which regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, according to the group.",
      "FACA requires these groups to be \"fairly balanced in terms of the points of view represented and the functions to be performed by the advisory committee,\" the lawsuit states. The lawsuit was filed shortly after noon Eastern time in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, National Security Counselors told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The law requires that advisory committees are \"objective and accessible to the public,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to the U.S. General Services Administration.",
      "A coalition representing veterans, public health professionals, teachers and other groups also filed a suit Monday against DOGE, citing FACA and asking a court to block DOGE's activities until it complies with law.",
      "\"The question every American should be asking is 'What are they hiding?'\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, a legal organization representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement. \"DOGE must not be allowed to operate in the shadows without the transparency, oversight, and opportunity for public participation required of any federal department by the law.\"",
      "Neither the Trump campaign nor Elon Musk immediately responded to a request for comment. Ramaswamy is expected to step away from DOGE as he embarks on a campaign for Ohio governor later this month.",
      "DOGE breaking the law?",
      "DOGE, which isn't an official government agency, was tasked by Trump to produce recommendations on trimming federal outlays, with billionaires Musk and Ramaswamy saying they aimed to cut about $500 billion in annual expenditures. The lawsuit claims that DOGE so far appears to have largely appointed three types of people to work on its efforts: tech industry executives, people affiliated with the Trump campaign and his prior administration as well as associates of Musk or Ramaswamy's.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that, as a result, DOGE is in violation of FACA because \"not a single member of DOGE is a federal employee or represents the perspective of federal employees, despite the evidence that DOGE intends to provide recommendations regarding federal employment practices and ways to reduce the size of the federal workforce.\"",
      "It also claims that DOGE is violating the law's mandate that advisory committee meetings must be open to the public, noting that Musk and Ramaswamy have held private meetings with various elected officials, as well as with tech executives.",
      "\"Nobody disputes that there is a huge amount of wasteful spending in the federal government,\" Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our only concern is that DOGE, as it is currently constituted, lacks the expertise to understand how its recommendations will backfire if it pushes federal workers out without understanding why they are there in the first place.",
      "He added, \"Government work is not corporate work, and any recommendations made without that perspective are doomed to fail.\"",
      "The lawsuit's plaintiffs include two men who sent in applications to be hired by DOGE. One, Jerald Lentini, is an attorney for National Security Counselors, while the second, Joshua Erlich, is an attorney who frequently represents federal employees and could represent their viewpoints, the lawsuit notes. Neither has heard back from DOGE about their applications.",
      "\"Plaintiffs conclude that, upon information and belief, neither Lentini nor Erlich, nor anyone similarly situated who would represent the perspectives of federal employees (including national security employees), unions, or accountability and transparency advocates, will be selected for DOGE,\" the lawsuit claims.",

    "story": [
      "Davos, Switzerland \u2014 Billionaires' wealth grew three times faster in 2024 than the year before, a top anti-poverty group reported on Monday as some of the world's political and financial elite prepared for an annual gathering in Davos, Switzerland.",
      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",
      "Oxfam said billionaire wealth grew by $2 trillion last year, or roughly $5.7 billion a day, three-times faster than in 2023. The number of billionaires rose by 204 to 2,769, and the 10 richest men saw their wealth rise nearly $100 million a day on average, it said.",
      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

    "summary": "U.S. officials have long feared that the widely popular short-form video app could be used as a vehicle for espionage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The 170 million TikTok users in the U.S. were in for a rude awakening late Saturday night when the enormously popular video-sharing app became inaccessible because of a law passed by a bipartisan majority in Congress last year.",
      "TikTok voluntarily shut down service to its users ahead of Sunday's ban. Users in the U.S. who opened the app were greeted with a message with the headline, \"Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.\"",
      "\"A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,\" the message reads. \"Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned!\"",
      "TikTok was also no longer available in the Apple or Google Play stores. CBS News has reached out to TikTok for comment.",
      "Lawmakers and U.S. officials have sounded the alarm for years about the supposed risks that TikTok's ties to China pose to national security, and Congress moved last year to force TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market. The law gave the company a deadline of Jan. 19 \u2014 one day before a new president would take office.",
      "With no sign of a sale in sight, TikTok's last-ditch legal challenge failed on Friday\u00a0when the Supreme Court said the law does not violate the First Amendment.",
      "The Biden White House said it will leave enforcement of the law to the incoming Trump administration, and President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to \"save\" the app. On Saturday, Trump told NBC News he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law allows the president, under some circumstances, to grant a one-time extension of up to 90 days regarding the date when the law goes into effect.",
      "TikTok had hinted it would take itself offline, a move that leaves content creators and users in the lurch as the company seeks a way to get back on firm legal footing.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that the Biden administration had \"failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans. Unless the Biden Administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre had earlier Saturday called TikTok's latest statement \"a stunt.\"",
      "\"We have seen the most recent statement from TikTok,\" Jean-Pierre said. \"It is a stunt, and we see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday. We have laid out our position clearly and straightforwardly: actions to implement this law will fall to the next administration. So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",

      "Another user with more than 800,000 views focused on specific items and services she wouldn't be buying or would swap for free alternatives, including hair salon visits (by embracing her natural color and trimming at home), new mugs (using what she already has), and books (using the library instead).",
      "\"Taking control of your finances can absolutely help you feel more in control of your life overall, and that sense of control is incredibly important for mental well-being,\" Berwise said. \"A big part of financial stress comes from focusing on things we can't control \u2014 like rising prices or taxes. But when we shift our focus to what is within our control, like budgeting intentionally and creating realistic financial plans, it can be empowering.\"",
      "Low-buy challenges can also be an opportunity to connect with other things that spark joy beyond spending.",

      "Set a realistic goal",

      "Focus on moving forward",
      "\"It's not about perfection; it's about progress. If you slip up, it's OK. Treat yourself with compassion and refocus. Small, intentional steps can make a big difference in both your financial and emotional well-being,\" Berwise said.",

    "story": [
      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",
      "In a statement late Friday, TikTok said the White House and Justice Department have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.\"",
      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 21:04:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court unanimously found the new law that could lead to a ban of TikTok does not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday rejected a challenge to a new law requiring TikTok to either sever ties with its China-based parent company or be banned in the United States, finding it did not violate the First Amendment rights of the platform or its users.",
      "The high court's unsigned decision clears the way for the law, passed last April, to take effect at midnight Sunday, and follows years of concerns raised by the federal government \u2014 during both the Trump and Biden administrations \u2014 about the risks TikTok poses to national security.",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat.",
      "What the Supreme Court said in its ruling on the TikTok ban",
      "\"The act's prohibitions and divestiture requirement are designed to prevent China \u2014 a designated foreign adversary \u2014 from leveraging its control over ByteDance Ltd. to capture the personal data of U.S. TikTok users. This objective qualifies as an important government interest under intermediate scrutiny,\" the court said, referencing the middle standard applied by courts to assess the constitutionality of a law.",
      "Under intermediate scrutiny, a challenged law must further an important government interest and be substantially related to that interest to be upheld. It is a less demanding standard than strict scrutiny, the highest level of judicial review, and more stringent than rational-basis review, the lowest, most lenient tier.",
      "The court noted that TikTok \"collects extensive personal information from and about its users,\" including location data and contact lists. The justices reiterated the government's concerns that such information may allow China to track the locations of federal employees, craft dossiers of information for blackmail and conduct corporate espionage.",
      "The court's opinion also cited Congress' finding that under Chinese law, companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" it said.",
      "The court went on to say that the law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, is \"sufficiently tailored to address the government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary from collecting vast swaths of sensitive data about the 170 million U.S. persons who use TikTok.\"",
      "Its provisions \"clearly serve the government's data collection interest,\" the court said, and are not broader than needed to address concerns about China's access to Americans' personal information.",
      "The court noted the government's interest in preventing China from having control over TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm and its ability to covertly alter the content appearing on the app for users in the U.S. But it said the record in the case \"adequately supports the conclusion that Congress would have passed the challenged provisions based on the data collection justification alone.\"",
      "According to Congress and the Biden administration, the court said, ByteDance uses data collected from TikTok to train the app's recommendation algorithm and would not agree to stop collecting U.S. users' data or sending it to China. The government also noted the challenges with monitoring data-sharing between TikTok and its parent company.",
      "\"Under these circumstances, we find the government's data collection justification sufficient to sustain the challenged provisions,\" the court said.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch issued a separate opinion agreeing with the outcome of the case, but splitting with the court's legal reasoning. He wrote that the court was right to refrain from endorsing the government's goal of preventing the purported covert manipulation of content by China.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" he wrote. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "Gorsuch concluded his opinion by noting that \"speaking with and in favor of a foreign adversary is one thing. Allowing a foreign adversary to spy on Americans is another.\"",
      "The law at issue in the case requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, had\u00a0urged the court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law to allow him to pursue a \"political resolution\" once he takes office, but said following the ruling that he \"must have time to review the situation.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",
      "\"President Biden's position on TikTok has been clear for months, including since Congress sent a bill in overwhelming, bipartisan fashion to the president's desk: TikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law,\" she said. \"Given the sheer fact of timing, this administration recognizes that actions to implement the law simply must fall to the next administration, which takes office on Monday.\"",
      "What happens to TikTok when the Sunday deadline arrives is still unclear.",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News Friday evening, TikTok said that \"the statements issued today by both the Biden White House and the Department of Justice have failed to provide the necessary clarity and assurance to the service providers that are integral to maintaining TikTok's availability to over 170 million Americans.

      "The court's ruling comes days before the law, which was passed with bipartisan majorities of Congress last April, is set to take effect. TikTok and a group of content creators who use the app argued the law infringes on their free speech rights, and the Supreme Court heard arguments in their bid to block it one week ago.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "\"The challenged provisions further an important government interest unrelated to the suppression of free expression and do not burden substantially more speech than necessary to further that interest,\" the court said, adding that the law's requirements that TikTok either divest or face a ban are designed to prevent China from gaining access to the personal data from the app's U.S. users.",
      "Called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, the law requires TikTok to either divest from ByteDance, its parent company, or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services beginning Jan. 19.

      "In response to the ruling, Trump wrote on Truth Social\u00a0that it was \"expected, and everyone must respect it. My decision on TikTok will be made in the not too distant future, but I must have time to review the situation. Stay tuned!\"",
      "With the Supreme Court declining to throw TikTok a lifeline, the immediate effects on access to the app as of Sunday's deadline aren't clear. Reuters reported Wednesday that the company planned to shut down for U.S. users once the ban takes effect. Those trying to open the app would be greeted with a pop-up message directing them to a website with information about the new law, according to the report.",
      "Many users have begun downloading their videos and data from TikTok in anticipation of a ban and migrating to other platforms, including the Chinese-owned RedNote.",
      "White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said the Biden administration will not begin enforcing the law beginning on Sunday, leaving it to the incoming Trump administration.",

      "Trump could decline to enforce the ban, but companies like Apple and Google could still potentially face steep fines if they host the app in violation of the law. During arguments last week, the government noted there is a five-year statute of limitations for violations of the law, meaning a future administration could punish offenders.",
      "TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in a video that the company \"will do everything in its power to ensure our platform thrives\" for users. He also explicitly thanked Trump for \"his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"",
      "\"We are grateful and pleased to have the support of a president who truly understands our platform, one who has used TikTok to express his own thoughts and perspectives, connecting with the world and generating more than 60 billion views of his content in the process,\" Chew said.",
      "TikTok and the Supreme Court",
      "Congress and the Biden administration have raised national security concerns about TikTok for years. Federal employees cannot have the app on their government-issued phones, and a majority of states have barred the platform on state government devices.",
      "The law aims to prevent China from collecting substantial amounts of data from the platform's 170 million U.S. users and covertly manipulate the content on TikTok to harm the U.S. by sowing discord and division, federal officials have said.",
      "But TikTok, which curates short videos for users through a powerful recommendation algorithm, said it is a U.S. company that is protected by the First Amendment from Congress' attempt to ban the platform.",
      "During arguments, the justices appeared poised to uphold the law, though several expressed concerns that it could conflict with the First Amendment. Still, many of the court's members seemed to agree that the law targeted TikTok's ownership by a foreign company, ByteDance, instead of the speech shared on the platform.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who argued for the U.S. government, said the \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data collected by TikTok would give the Chinese government \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\" She cited several data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are, what our interests are and what our vices are,\" Pregolar said.",
      "Noel Francisco, who argued on behalf of TikTok and ByteDance, said the Supreme Court's decision would be \"enormously consequential.\" If the companies are forced to cut ties, he said, TikTok \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. Other social media platforms have tried to replicate the algorithm, but have been unable to match TikTok's, according to Jeffrey Fisher, who represented the creators. China has said it is opposed to the sale of TikTok's algorithm.",
      "If the law is not paused or overturned by Jan. 19, \"we go dark,\" Francisco said. \"The platform shuts down,\" he said, later clarifying that TikTok would no longer be available in U.S. app stores. If TikTok doesn't shut down voluntarily, experts told CBS News that the experience for users who already have it on their phones would likely suffer with time because they would no longer receive software updates.",
      "Several of the justices on the liberal and conservative wings of the bench repeatedly raised concerns about TikTok's collection of data from its American users and the Chinese government's access to that personal information.",
      "\"Are we supposed to ignore the fact that the ultimate parent is, in fact, subject to doing intelligence work for the Chinese government?\" Chief Justice John Roberts asked Francisco, referring to ByteDance.",
      "Congress found that ByteDance is subject to Chinese laws that require it to cooperate with the Chinese government's intelligence work and ensure it has the power to access private data the company holds, Roberts said.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh, too, warned of the future implications of the Chinese government having access to data from the tens of millions of Americans who use TikTok every month.",
      "Congress and the president, he said, were worried that China \"would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or the State Department. Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Francisco claimed that TikTok would \"have to go mute\" unless it severs ties from ByteDance, but Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pushed back on that characterization of the law.",
      "\"If TikTok were to, post-divestiture or whatever, pre-divestiture, come up with its own algorithm, then when the divestiture happened, it could still operate. It doesn't say, 'TikTok, you can't speak,'\" she said, adding that TikTok can remain in the U.S. as long as it's not associated with ByteDance.",
      "In its opinion, the high court focused primarily on the data collection concerns raised by Congress and the Justice Department, finding that the law is sufficiently tailored to address the U.S. government's interest in preventing a foreign adversary, China, from collecting \"vast swaths\" of sensitive information from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users.",
      "Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them. Without question, the First Amendment has much to say about the right to make those choices.\"",
      "For Americans who rely on TikTok to exchange ideas about all manner of topics, from politics to entertainment to the news, the stakes of the case are high. Creators who challenged the law said they use it to sell products, reach thousands of people and create a nationwide community.",
      "\"That's our editor and publisher of choice that we think best disseminates our speech,\" Fisher said.",
      "Trump attempted to effectively ban TikTok during his first term in office because of national security concerns, though his executive order targeting the app was blocked by a federal court and then rescinded by Mr. Biden. But the president-elect has reversed course on his view of the platform.",
      "Trump told Newsmax in an interview this week that he's \"not opposed\" to TikTok and said his campaign's use of the app helped him win over young voters in the November presidential election.",

Walgreens allegedly filled prescriptions for dangerous and excessive quantities of opioids, the lawsuit said, including early refills among other prescriptions.",
      "\"Our complaint alleges that Walgreens pharmacists filled millions of controlled substance prescriptions with clear red flags that indicated the prescriptions were highly likely to be unlawful, and that Walgreens systematically pressured its pharmacists to fill prescriptions, including controlled substance prescriptions, without taking the time needed to confirm their validity,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Brian M. Boynton, head of the Justice Department's Civil Division said in a statement. \"These practices allowed millions of opioid pills and other controlled substances to flow illegally out of Walgreens stores.\"",
      "Walgreens pharmacists filled these unlawful prescriptions despite clear \"red flags,\" the complaint alleges, and the pharmacy giant ignored substantial evidence from multiple sources that its stores were dispensing unlawful prescriptions, including from its own pharmacists and internal data, the suit claims.",
      "Pharmacists were pressured to fill prescriptions quickly without taking the time needed to confirm each prescription's validity, the complaint said. Walgreens also deprived pharmacists of crucial information and prevented them from warning one another about certain prescribers.",
      "Four different whistleblowers who previously worked for Walgreens in various parts of the country filed whistleblower actions, the statement said.",
      "Walgreens responded to the lawsuit in a statement on its website which read that it stands \"behind our pharmacists, dedicated healthcare professionals who live in the communities they serve, filling legitimate prescriptions for FDA-approved medications written by DEA-licensed prescribers in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations.\"",

    "title": "As Biden exits, how will he be remembered for his handling of the U.S. economy?",
    "published": "Fri, 17 Jan 2025 17:25:31 -0500",
    "summary": "The economy rebounded strongly from the COVID shock, but the U.S. continues to grapple with a cost-of-living crisis and spiraling federal debt.",
    "story": [
      "As President Biden prepares to depart the White House, he leaves an economic legacy marked by a historic pandemic that paralyzed consumers and businesses across the U.S.",
      "After inheriting a COVID-scarred nation in 2021, Mr. Biden focused on righting the economy, a strategy that economists told CBS MoneyWatch is visible in the country's solid GDP growth and low unemployment. By several key measures, the economy is stronger than it was four years ago: The jobless rate is near a 50-year low, wages are growing and the U.S. managed to sidestep a recession widely expected by many on Wall Street as the Federal Reserve moved to curb inflation by ratcheting up interest rates.",
      "\"He should have a strong legacy when it comes to the economy,\" Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics, said of Mr. Biden. \"He inherited an economy that was flat on its back because of the COVID pandemic, and he's leaving an economy that's flying high, at least in the aggregate,\"",
      "Zandi added, \"How much he can take credit for that, it's a reasonable debate, but I think he deserves a lot of credit.\"",
      "Zandi pointed to several pieces of landmark legislation passed under Biden, including the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, as helping to stabilize the nation and produce growth that has surpassed most other major economies around the world.",
      "Biden also score some wins on health care, such as a new $2,000 out-of-pocket\u00a0spending cap on prescriptions for Medicare enrollees and a $35 cap on insulin prices.",
      "Yet in retrospect, he added, additional trillions in federal stimulus may have played a part in the soaring inflation of the last few years, which Zandi said was also fueled by the economic impact of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.",
      "ARPA \"was very controversial, but at the end of the day it got the economy back to full employment,\" Zandi said.",
      "Deep structural problems",
      "Although Biden's policies were key in helping the economy recover from the pandemic, millions of Americans continue to struggle with a cost-of-living crisis worsened by the hottest inflation in four decades. Long-term challenges in housing affordability only deepened during the Biden administration, while U.S. wealth inequality today remains near record levels.",
      "To be sure, health care, child care and education costs have outpaced inflation\u00a0for years, weighing on millions households and making many families vulnerable to even minor downturns. But the inflation spike in 2022 intensified these existing financial pains, said Lindsay Owens, executive director of the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive economic think tank.",
      "\"The American economy for a long time has been characterized by a lack of affordability for the biggest ticket items,\" Owens said. \"Housing has been out of reach, health care has been expensive, child care is expensive \u2014 that was all true before Biden.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a Biden plan to sweep away student loan debt was largely\u00a0shot down by the courts, although the Department of Education used other means to offer relief to millions of borrowers. Housing costs continued to soar under Biden due to rising home values as well as soaring mortgage rates after the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates to battle inflation.",
      "The upshot: Under Biden, many households remained dogged by the same long-term pocketbook issues that have prevailed for decades under previous presidential administrations. During the pandemic, the soaring cost of essentials like food, fuel and rent only deepened the country's widespread precarity \u2014 a gnawing sense of financial insecurity that has left tens of millions of Americans vulnerable to job losses, medical problems and even modest economic dips.",
      "Ballooning debt",
      "Biden's legislative wins \u2014 ARPA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act in 2022 \u2014 added trillions in additional federal spending. The idea underlying these efforts was to rejuvenate the U.S. economy by investing in key sectors, such as by building semiconductor chip plants, rebuilding U.S. roads or accelerating the shift toward green energy.",
      "But those efforts will likely take years to pay off, economists note. In the meantime, the nation's debt has ballooned to a record $36.2 trillion as of mid-January due to a combination of fiscal stimulus authorized by both Biden and Trump, as well as Trump's 2017 tax cuts.",
      "With federal spending outpacing revenues, the nation will face tough choices, such as whether to raise taxes, cut federal programs or both. Asked to describe Biden's economic legacy, Cato Institute vice president of general economics Scott Lincicome summarized it in one word: \"Frustrating.\"",
      "\"If you could look at the basic fundamentals \u2014 economic growth, jobs \u2014 things have been pretty good,\" Lincicome, who describes himself as a \"libertarian free marketer,\" added. \"But if you look beneath the hood, there are some rather significant problems.\"",
      "Chief among them are the nation's spiraling debt, Lincicome said. Treasury yields have been rising ahead of Trump's inauguration on Monday, partly due to concerns that the U.S. could struggle in coming years to service its debt.",
      "\"In terms of what Trump inherits \u2014 and it's not just Biden's fault, Trump did a lot of COVID spending, too \u2014 but we're now at a point where you can see bond markets are chirping, and you can see inflation has remained stubbornly higher than we would have hoped,\" Lincicome noted. \"The [Congressional Budget Office] and a lot of other folks agree that the debt is a pretty pressing issue.\"",
      "Trump's economy on Jan. 20",
      "Despite such concerns, the economists interviewed by CBS MoneyWatch say that Trump will inherit a strong economy when he's inaugurated. The nation's unemployment rate is 4.1%, down from 6.4% when Biden took office in January of 2021. In another plus for workers, average hourly earnings through December rose\u00a03.9%, keeping pay growth\u00a0ahead of consumer prices, which are up 2.9% over the last year.",
      "Not surprising, then, that Zandi and Lincicome had the same advice for the Trump administration in how it handles the U.S. economy: \"Do no harm.\"",
      "\"The best thing Trump could do is do nothing,\" Zandi said. \"Biden got a basket case economy and he's bequeathing an economy that is operating at full tilt.\"",
      "For his part, Trump has signaled his intent to reshape the economy through a combination of steeper tariffs, deeper tax cuts, fewer federal regulations and mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Joe Biden's legacy is marred by crippling inflation, a migrant crime invasion and American weakness on the world stage,\" Trump-Vance Transition Spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Thankfully, in just five days, President Trump will usher in a new Golden Age of American success and carry out his mandate to make America wealthy, safe, strong and great again.\"",
      "Economists view some of Trump's stated plans as potentially inflationary, although some question whether the president-elect will follow through with all of them, such as a broad-based tariff on all imports.",
      "\"We expect tariffs on imports from China and autos, but not a universal tariff, which would carry economic and political risks that we think the White House will prefer to avoid,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a December research note.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration wants to extend his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), an effort the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected could add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Trump has vowed that his tariffs would raise enough money to cover the tax cuts, a proposition that economists assess as unlikely.",
      "Tariffs could raise \"a few hundred billion, maybe, but that's total, and you're still in a massive hole,\" Lincicome noted.",
      "American oligarchs",
      "Extending the tax cuts would also likely favor the nation's wealthiest households, given that the TCJA cut taxes for top earners far more than for low- or middle-income Americans. During the past four years, America's richest people have seen their wealth soar, with Elon Musk \u2014 the world's richest person and a close adviser and backer of Trump \u2014 now worth $450 billion, more than double his $175 billion net worth when Biden was inaugurated in 2021, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his farewell message on Wednesday, Biden warned that the growing concentration of wealth in the U.S. poses a serious risk to the nation.",
      "\"Today, an oligarchy is taking shape in America of extreme wealth, power and influence that literally threatens our entire democracy, our basic rights and freedoms and a fair shot for everyone to get ahead,\" Biden said.",
      "That's unlikely to change under Trump, economists predicted \"The big story of American inequality is a simple one: It's the takeoff in top incomes,\" Owens noted.",
      "She believes that \"Until we tax the top, we will have runaway income inequality.\"",

    "summary": "JSB and Perdue Farms agreed to settlements of $4 million each, while QSA, which employed 54 children, will pay $400,000.",
    "story": [
      "The problem of kids working in dangerous slaughterhouses continues to be a concern as the Labor Department announced its third agreement this week with a company in the industry agreeing to pay a penalty and reform its practices to help ensure it won't hire underage workers again.",
      "On Thursday, the Department said investigators found that another slaughterhouse cleaning company called QSI had employed 54 children at 13 meatpacking plants in eight states on overnight shifts sanitizing the industrial carving and slicing machines companies use to produce beef and chicken between 2021 and 2024. This is at least the fourth example of one of these cleaning contractors being caught employing kids in the last two-and-a-half years. QSI will pay a $400,000 penalty.",
      "QSI disputes the way the Department describes the problem and points out that investigators weren't able to find any current juvenile workers and didn't require a formal court agreement with ongoing monitoring like they did a couple years ago with the most egregious offender: the PSSI cleaning company that ultimately paid more than $1.5 million and agreed to changes.",
      "Earlier this week, Perdue Farms agreed to pay $4 million after children were found working at one of its chicken processing plants in Virginia. One day earlier, meatpacking giant JBS Foods also agreed to pay $4 million and make changes to try to keep kids from getting jobs at its plants.",
      "All three of these announcements come just days before President elect Donald Trump takes office, but they follow a number of other child labor investigations in the meatpacking industry in the past few years. To Debbie Berkowitz, who was a top OSHA official in the Obama administration, the flurry of announcements this week helps solidify the Biden administration's legacy of trying to \"stamp out child labor in this very dangerous meat and poultry industry\" while putting the new administration on notice.",

      "It's against the law for anyone under the age of 18 to work at a dangerous job like a meatpacking plant, but ever since the PSSI investigation was announced in the fall of 2022 investigators keep finding more examples of it.

      "That prompted additional investigations and a broad call for the meatpacking industry to tighten up its hiring practices to make sure kids don't get hired. Sometimes the major meat companies, like JBS, Tyson Foods, Cargill and Smithfield Foods, have pointed to contractors as the ones with hiring problems, but officials maintain that the big companies are responsible for all their contractors taking appropriate precautions.",

In May 2023, a Tennessee-based sanitation company, Fayette Janitorial Service, agreed to pay nearly $650,000 in civil penalties after a federal investigation found it illegally hired at least two dozen children to clean dangerous meat processing facilities in Iowa and Virginia.",
      "In addition to the federal investigations some states got involved. Last fall, Smithfield Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processors, agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations of child labor violations at a plant in Minnesota.",
      "The Labor Department said that QSI, which is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, as part of a company called the Vincit Group, employed children on overnight shifts at 13 meat processing plants in Collinsville, Alabama; Livingston, California; Harbeson and Georgetown, Delaware; Milford, Indiana; Ottumwa, Iowa; Canton and Winesburg, Ohio; Shelbyville and Morristown, Tennessee; and Temperanceville, Virginia. The Department didn't name the companies that own those plants",
      "QSI spokesman Dan Scorpio said he doesn't believe that's accurate because investigators didn't provide details of the violations the company could verify. \"QSI has a zero-tolerance policy for any employment of underage workers,\" he said. \"We have taken extensive steps over the last two and a half years to strengthen our hiring and compliance practices as we continue to serve our customers with integrity and excellence.\"",

But everyone has a responsibility to keep children \u2014 our most vulnerable workers \u2014 safe,\" the Department said.",
      "Hundreds of ongoing investigations",
      "The Labor Department has more than 1,000 open child labor investigations it is pursuing. And every one of these settlements includes a set of standards for hiring practices that the Labor Department believes will help keep kids from getting hired.",

      "\"Wegovy, Ozempic, they all have the same active ingredient. That's how the law was written, and that is what we implemented,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump change or halt the process?",
      "It is unclear whether President-elect Donald Trump would seek to change the drugs picked or stop the talks after he takes office. On the campaign trail, he often pledged not to make cuts to Medicare after Democrats sought to tie him to a \"Project 2025\" proposal to undo the program.",
      "Speaking with reporters on Thursday, a senior Biden administration official said that the process to pick the drugs for the negotiation program was hemmed in by the law Congress passed.",
      "That law requires Medicare to essentially make a list of eligible drugs for the program, and then select the drugs\u00a0that make up the 15 highest in spending from Part D.",
      "\"That process, again, is clearly defined in statute. There is no ability for a policy official to say, I prefer this drug over that drug. The entire process is based on these data,\" the official said.",
      "A spokesperson for the president-elect did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The bulk of staff working on the negotiation program are career staff running the talks, Brooks-Lasure said, not political appointees who will leave during the transition.",
      "\"There is so much technical information that is passed back and forth during that negotiation and that is largely done by people who will stay here,\" said Brooks-Lasure.",
      "\"We have got to get a handle on prescription drug costs in this country, and it's crucial that Medicare, the CMS staff are negotiating lower prices. It's important for the people taking the drugs. It's also important for the entire Medicare program. We want to make sure this program is here for us and our children,\" she said.",
      "Which drugs were selected for the first round?",
      "The Biden administration announced the 10 drugs selected for the first round of the Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program in August 2023, and reached an agreement in August 2024.",

      "Block, the parent company of popular online payment service Cash App, has been ordered by a federal agency to pay as much as $175 million because of repeated failures by the financial services provider to protect customers from fraud.",
      "Block has agreed to pay up to $120 million to consumers harmed by fraudulent transactions and unfair business practices detailed by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in a consent order filed on Thursday. The company must also pay a fine of $55 million into the CFPB's victims relief fund.",
      "\"Cash App created the conditions for fraud to proliferate on its popular payment platform,\" CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement. \"When things went wrong, Cash App flouted its responsibilities and even burdened local banks with problems that the company caused.\"",
      "Block disputes the CFPB's findings.",

      "The company also said it uses a number of means to support customers and ensure they are protected while using Cash App. Those include providing multiple ways for customers to contact Block, such as a dispute submission tool within Cash App; using AI to spot and stop fraud; and using advanced technology to warn customers about potential scams involving their transactions.",
      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

      "The world's largest retailer in November joined a growing list of corporations ditching their DEI programs after coming under attack by conservative activists. The sweeping changes included a decision by Walmart not to renew a five-year commitment for an equity racial center set up in 2020 after\u00a0the police killing of George Floyd. Walmart also said it would no long consider race or gender in its treatment of suppliers.",
      "Organized by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition that seeks to influence corporate behavior, the investors requested a meeting with Walmart leaders about the change in policy, noting they had for decades supplied data illustrating the business hazards linked to discrimination and inequity.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's pick to be treasury secretary, Scott Bessent fielded sharp questions Thursday at his confirmation hearing from Democrats and Republicans on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the IRS tax filing system.",
      "Bessent told the Senate Finance Committee that the U.S. faces economic calamity if Congress doesn't renew provisions of Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. He also argued the Federal Reserve should remain independent from the president's influence and U.S. sanctions on Russian oil should be more aggressive.",
      "He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary \"who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.\" Graham added, \"Your ship came in with this guy.\"",
      "But Democrats, including Sens. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion.",
      "Bennet accused Bessent of shedding \"crocodile tears\" over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. \"There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe\" from the tax cuts.",
      "Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, including Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats.",
      "GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin also asked Bessent a series of questions about reducing national spending to pre-pandemic levels.",
      "In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS' Direct File program \u2014 which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free \u2014 at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers call the program a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular.",
      "He also called for stronger sanctions on Russia, criticizing the Biden administration for a sanctions regime he said isn't \"muscular\" enough. \"I believe the previous administration was worried about raising U.S. energy prices during an election season,\" Bessent said.",
      "Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee, also mulling over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary.",
      "The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council.",
      "If confirmed, Bessent would oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut.",
      "Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident.",
      "\"Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,\" Bessent testified.",
      "Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight.",
      "In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. During the hearing, Bessent said he and his husband are up to date on their taxes, and he is in litigation over the portion of his taxes in controversy. He also committed to shuttering his firm if confirmed to be treasury secretary.",
      "Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years.",
      "He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.",

Met with a round of applause at the NCAA's convention in Nashville, Tennessee, the unanimous vote was the final buzzer-beater in establishing a pay structure for women competing in March Madness.",

It will increase to $20 million for the 2026-27 fiscal year and reach $25 million starting with the 2027-28 fiscal year. The units earned will be paid out to the schools starting in 2026 on a rolling three-year basis.",
      "The longer a school stays in the tournament, the more units the school's conference receives. With a Final Four appearance, a team could bring its conference $1.26 million over the next three years. The revenue distribution plan for the women's tournament is similar to the men's.",
      "\"This is a historic day for women's sports, women's basketball and the NCAA,\" NCAA President Charlie Baker said in a statement. \"We have made investing in women's sports a priority, and today's vote means our members have the opportunity to do even more on campus to promote and support female athletes. I can't wait to see all the incredible things they do.\"",

It also outdrew the men's national championship game by 3 million viewers.",
      "Viewing records were set across all six rounds as fans watched outstanding players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark take on South Carolina head coach Dawn Staley and the undefeated Gamecocks.

      "Bueckers, who is expected to be a top pick in the 2025 WNBA draft if she decides not to return to the Huskies for another year, said revenue sharing is a step in the right direction. \"I think that's huge, just for women's hoop, continuing to capitalize on what we've brought to the sport and what we do for just sport in general and entertainment,\" Bueckers told reporters.",
      "\"It's capitalizing on the momentum that's out there,\" UConn head coach Geno Auriemma said. \"It's a statement that they made today about where women's basketball fits into the big picture of college athletics.\"",

      "Danielle Hegseth said she was providing the response because she does not think her former brother-in-law is fit to serve as defense secretary. She encouraged the Senate to consider the affidavit in its vote on Hegseth's nomination, which advanced out of committee on Monday.",
      "Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations in a statement, saying that Hegseth's ex-wife \"has never alleged that there was any abuse.\" He said Samantha Hegseth signed court documents to that effect and reaffirmed that there was no abuse during her FBI interview.",
      "\"Belated claims by Danielle Dietrich, an anti-Trump far left Democrat who is divorced from Mr. Hegseth's brother and never got along with the Hegseth family, do nothing to change that,\" Parlatore said. \"After an acrimonious divorce, Ms. Dietrich has had an axe to grind against the entire Hegseth family. Ms. Dietrich admits that she saw nothing but is now falsely accusing Sam of lying to both the Court and to the FBI because of private, undocumented statements that she allegedly made 10 years ago.\"",
      "Samantha Hegseth could not immediately be reached for comment, but told NBC News in an email that \"I do not believe your information to be accurate\" and declined to speak about her marriage to Hegseth.",

      "Hegseth faced intense scrutiny over reports about his background, and for weeks was considered to have the steepest path to confirmation out of\u00a0 Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees.

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday to stop President Trump's executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked presidential powers to begin his long-promised immigration crackdown shortly after taking office on Monday. His executive actions included an order directing the federal government to stop issuing passports, citizenship certificates and other documents to many children born in the U.S. whose mothers are in the country illegally, or for whom neither parent is a legal permanent resident.",
      "The lawsuit by the 18 states, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, claims Mr. Trump's initiative violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the federal government has long interpreted to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth. The cities of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., also joined the suit. The 14th Amendment says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"The great promise of our nation is that everyone born here is a citizen of the United States, able to achieve the American dream,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement to CBS News. \"This fundamental right to birthright citizenship, rooted in the 14th Amendment and born from the ashes of slavery, is a cornerstone of our nation's commitment to justice.\"",
      "The suit is seeking a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the executive order, and ultimately, to invalidate it. The states that joined the suit are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "\"The President's executive order attempting to rescind birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional and quite frankly, un-American,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"We are asking a court to immediately block this order from taking effect and ensure that the rights of American-born children impacted by this order remain in effect while litigation proceeds. The President has overstepped his authority by a mile with this order, and we will hold him accountable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump directed that his order should be enforced in 30 days. It was challenged soon after it was issued, when the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups filed a separate lawsuit seeking to thwart it.",
      "Later Tuesday, a group of four more states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Washington and Oregon \u2014 filed a separate lawsuit of their own in Washington state targeting the executive order.",
      "\"We need to discuss bipartisan commonsense immigration reforms, but denying birthright citizenship, which dates back centuries and has been upheld twice by the U.S. Supreme Court, is not the solution,\" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.",

      "\"I think it sends the message that politics is more important than policing,\" Manger told \"CBS Evening News\" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell on Tuesday.",
      "Hours after Mr. Trump was sworn in on Monday, he granted clemency to about 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes related to the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Among those who received clemency are people who were convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy.",
      "The president also ordered the Justice Department to end all pending cases connected to the riot, abruptly ending the department's massive effort under former President Joe Biden to hold those who participated in the attack accountable.",
      "\"I'm concerned for my officers. I'm concerned about what message they get from these actions,\" Manger said, adding that it could prompt officers to question why they put themselves in harm's way.",
      "\"My concern is the message that it sends when people who are arrested for committing violence against police officers are not held to account,\" he said. And I worry about the morale of my officers. I worry about just how this impacts them, and I don't want them handling some protest or making some arrest in the future and scratching their head wondering, 'Well, I wonder what's going to happen with this case?'\"",
      "He said many officers have expressed anger about the pardons.",
      "\"They're upset, and I don't blame them,\" Manger said.",
      "\"They believe that they were doing their job properly that day, and this sends a message to them that somehow it was OK for these folks to do the things that they did,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has long downplayed the events of that day, referring to the defendants as \"hostages.\" On Monday night, Mr. Trump said, \"these people have been destroyed.\" Mr. Trump added Tuesday, \"these people have already served years in prison.\"",
      "More than 140 officers from Capitol Police and the Metropolitan Police Department were assaulted during the riot, according to the Justice Department. Over 170 defendants were charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer during the siege that interrupted Congress as it was certifying Biden's 2020 election victory over Mr. Trump.",
      "Manger said he's \"always worried\" about the safety of his officers, but risks and threats come with the job.",
      "\"Cops will willingly put themselves in harm's way, and they don't ask a lot,\" he said. \"But I will tell you, it means a lot to those police officers if they know that they have the support of the community and that if something were to happen to them, that the community would do the right thing and take care of them.\"",
      "Manger also said Biden's commutation of the life sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier \"sends a pretty poor message\" to the FBI and all law enforcement. Peltier was convicted in the 1975 killing of two FBI agents.",
      "\"Those FBI agents are still dead, and yet, the man that killed them has been set free, and I think that the impact that that has on every man or woman who wears a badge in this country, it's just terrible for them,\" Manger said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday dramatically broadened the scope of expedited deportations, enacting a nationwide expansion of an immigration policy known as \"expedited removal\" that was previously limited to areas close to U.S. borders.",
      "Expedited removal allows U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants who lack proper documents through a streamlined process that bypasses the lengthy and massively backlogged immigration court system. If those identified for expedited removal do not request asylum or fail to establish they may have a legitimate asylum case, they can be expeditiously deported, without an opportunity to see an immigration judge.",
      "Before Tuesday's change, federal immigration officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Now, these expedited deportations will apply to unauthorized immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who can't prove they have been in the country for more than two years. The move by the Department of Homeland Security revived a first Trump administration policy that the Biden administration had discontinued. It took effect at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.",
      "In less than 48 hours since returning to the Oval Office, President Trump has already taken a flurry of actions, some of them unprecedented in nature, to launch a multi-faced crackdown on immigration.",
      "Mr. Trump shut down access to the U.S. asylum system using extraordinary presidential powers; declared a national emergency to dispatch more troops to the southern border; froze the refugee admissions programs; and directed federal agencies to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or on temporary visas. The latter action has already triggered lawsuits from Democratic-led states and pro-immigrant groups.",
      "The president has also laid the foundations for his promised mass deportations, directing federal officials to expand immigration detention facilities and allow local law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants. His administration rescinded Biden-era guidelines that barred deportation officers from making arrests at so-called \"sensitive locations,\" which include schools and churches.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0declaring that it's policy of the federal government to only recognize \"two sexes, male and female,\" reversing the ability of Americans to mark \"other\" or \"X\" on federal forms and causing sweeping implications in the way the federal government acknowledges gender.",
      "Mr. Trump has long pledged to alter the way the federal government handles the issue of gender identification, and on the campaign trail, his lines about preventing transgender athletes from participating in women's sports prompted some of the loudest reactions from his rally-goers.",
      "LGBTQ rights groups are pledging to challenge Trump's order where they can.",
      "\"Across the country, ideologues who deny the biological reality of sex have increasingly used legal and other socially coercive means to permit men to self-identify as women and gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women, from women's domestic abuse shelters to women's workplace showers,\" Mr. Trump's executive order reads. \"This is wrong.\"",
      "The order is at odds with the statements of transgender Americans, who say they are trying to use spaces that align with their gender identity, not \"gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.\"",
      "The president's executive order means the secretaries of the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management will require that government-issued identification documents, including visas, passports, and Global Entry cards, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\" Americans have been able to select \"X\" on their passports\u00a0since April 2022\u00a0under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The gender executive order also says the federal government is not to use terms like gender identity, instead using the sex assigned at birth.",
      "\"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology,\" the order reads. \"Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\"",
      "According to the LGBTQ media advocacy group GLAAD, \"gender ideology is not a term transgender people use to describe themselves, it is an inaccurate term deployed by opponents to undermine and dehumanize transgender and nonbinary people.\"",

      "Legally speaking, Thomas Berry, director at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said the executive order is wide-ranging, but aspects of it may run up against a 2020 Supreme Court decision. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 vote that it is\u00a0illegal for an employer to fire someone because they are gay or transgender.",
      "\"It's such wide-ranging executive order,\" Berry said of Mr. Trump's action. \"I think some he has the authority to do and some parts of it are going to be more controversial. So one thing that strikes me immediately that I'm curious about is to what extent is he going to try to push back against the Supreme Court's Bostock decision from within the last five years, where the Supreme Court explicitly held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to both sexual orientation as well as gender identity, and discrimination on the basis of gender identity. So that's \u2014 that's a statute, the interpretation of which is up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has made a binding decision.\"",
      "Berry said the federal government will likely have more latitude in how it applies the order internally within the federal government, such as how federal employees may identify.",
      "Supporters of LGBTQ   rights have vowed to fight the Trump administration's changes however they can.",
      "Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said the ACLU is closely studying the impact and implementation of the order. Strangio said Tuesday that it's not yet clear whether changes will be retroactive with, for instance, State-Department-issued passports.",
      "\"I would anticipate a lot of future legal actions, but all of that will depend on what we actually see from the various agencies charged with implementing the various pieces of this executive order,\" Strangio said.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel with Lambda Legal that focuses on LGBT civil rights issues, also mentioned the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock as potentially counter to this order.",
      "\"We stand ready to challenge any of these implementation actions,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, some conservatives are pleased by the order.",

      "The \"two sexes\" executive order is one of\u00a0more than 200 of executive actions\u00a0Mr. Trump took in his first day in office, ranging from attempting to end birthright citizenship to pardoning Jan. 6 rioters.",

      "President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order officially creating the Department of Government Efficiency, the cost-cutting initiative helmed by billionaires Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. The executive order included fresh details about DOGE's goals and structure, such as a mandate to upgrade the government's IT systems.",
      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",

      "Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan was ousted by the Trump administration Tuesday, on President Trump's first full day in office. In 2022, Fagan became the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. military.",

Fagan of her duties as Commandant of the United States Coast Guard,\" the brief message read, in part. \"She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation.\"",
      "The Coast Guard commandant is appointed for a four-year term, and Fagan had served two years.",
      "A senior DHS official said in a statement that Fagan was terminated \"because of her leadership deficiencies, operational failures, and inability to advance the strategic objectives of the U.S. Coast Guard.\"",
      "In particular, the official said she had failed to address border security threats, citing \"insufficient coordination\" with DHS on operations along maritime borders and \"ineffective deployment of Coast Guard assets\" to support efforts to interdict fentanyl and other illicit substances.",
      "The official also cited \"significant shortfalls\" in recruitment and mismanagement, including \"[i]nadequate accountability for acquisition failures highlighted during the Trump 45 Administration.\"",
      "During her time as head of the service, Fagan worked to bolster the recruitment and retention of personnel amid a slump in numbers across the U.S. armed forces. Last year,\u00a0as CBS News reported, the U.S. Coast Guard met its recruitment goals for its active-duty workforce, the reserves and officers for the first time since 2007.",
      "And Hagan was also criticized by the official for \"[e]xcessive focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies including at the US Coast Guard Academy, diverting resources and attention from operational imperatives.\"",
      "Fagan worked to rebuild trust within the halls of Congress and the agency's own ranks, following previous revelations that the\u00a0Coast Guard had mishandled sexual harassment and assault allegations. But the official said there had been a \"failure to adequately address the systemic issues\" and blamed Fagan for \"a leadership culture unwilling to ensure accountability and transparency in protecting service members.\"",
      "Adm. Kevin Lunday, the service's No. 2 in command, was named acting Coast Guard commandant, according to Huffman's note. Lunday became vice commandant last June.",
      "The Coast Guard, which sits under the Department of Homeland Security, has faced a budget crunch for several administrations. Several recent commandants, including Fagan, had urged lawmakers to fund the construction of new ships and repair of older ones to assist in the service's expanding global role in safeguarding national security.

      "Washington \u2014 Just hours after President Trump's inauguration, his administration revoked a Biden-era policy that prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents at or near schools, places of worship and other places deemed to be \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "Benjamine Huffman, whom the Trump administration installed as acting homeland security secretary pending the confirmation of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, issued a memo on Monday reversing the Biden administration's immigration arrest guidelines on \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "That policy, signed by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to refrain from apprehending unauthorized immigrants at or near locations \"that would restrain people's access to essential services or engagement in essential activities.\" Those locations included schools; places of worship; hospitals and other healthcare facilities; shelters; relief centers; and public demonstrations, like rallies and protests.",
      "In a statement defending the termination of the Biden administration rule, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration \"will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates had feared the rescission of the Biden-era rules, warning that it would allow the Trump administration to bring its mass deportations plans to churches and schools.",
      "But the Trump administration said Monday's decision was designed to target unauthorized immigrants with serious criminal histories.",
      "\"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens \u2014 including murders and rapists \u2014 who have illegally come into our country,\" DHS said in its statement. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest.\"",
      "Monday's action is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to eliminate limits other administrations have placed on ICE operations as it lays the groundwork for what the president has pledged will be the largest deportation operation in American history. The administration is expected to ramp up immigration arrests in cities and communities with \"sanctuary\" policies that restrict cooperation between local enforcement and ICE.",
      "The administration is also expected to rescind other Biden administration memos that discontinued mass immigration sweeps at worksites like factories and that limited ICE arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent border arrivals.",
      "Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" has repeatedly said the new administration, like every administration, will prioritize the arrest of immigrants who are in the country illegally and who have committed crimes. But he has stressed that no one will be exempt from immigration enforcement if they are in the U.S. illegally, warning that arrests of non-criminal unauthorized immigrants are likely.",
      "Mr. Trump moved swiftly on his first day back in the White House to launch his long-expected immigration crackdown, issuing a blitz of orders that sought to deny birthright citizenship to the children of unauthorized immigrants and temporary visas holders; suspend asylum and refugee admissions; and enlist the military's aid in border enforcement though an emergency declaration.",
      "Another executive order directed officials to expand detention sites to hold deportees and increase agreements with local law enforcement authorities, so they can arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants as deputized immigration officers.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik\u00a0focused on an \"America First\" message at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, and pledged to implement President Trump's agenda while rolling out a review of U.S. funding for some of the world body's agencies.",
      "Stefanik, one of President Trump's most reliable allies in Congress, appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for her confirmation hearing less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump was sworn into office. Mr. Trump hopes his key Cabinet picks will sail through confirmation, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was confirmed in a unanimous vote on Monday, and was sworn in on Tuesday. Stefanik is likely to be confirmed when the full Senate takes up a vote.",
      "Noting that the U.S. is the largest single contributor to the United Nations, she pointed to the children's agency UNICEF and the World Food Program as examples of U.N. entities that are \"effective,\" but said the U.S. has to ensure its investments are making America safer, stronger and more prosperous \u2014 echoing Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "\"Our tax dollars should not be complicit in propping up entities that are counter to American interests, antisemitic, or engaging in fraud, corruption or terrorism,\" Stefanik said in her opening remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "She stressed the need to reform the world body, where lawmakers raised the ability of American adversaries Russia and China to veto resolutions in the U.N. Security Council, and went so far as to say that it has not lived up to its founding mission.",
      "Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican committee chair, set the tone by sharply criticizing the U.N. at the start of the hearing, saying that Stefanik \"can bring much-needed change\" to the institution.",
      "\"At this point, the U.S. should seriously examine if further contributions and, indeed, participation in the U.N. is even beneficial to the American people,\" the Idaho lawmaker said.",
      "Harvard-educated and the fourth-ranking member of the U.S. House, Stefanik was elected to Congress in 2015 as a moderate Republican and is leaving a decade later as one of Trump's most ardent allies. She embraced Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as he denied he lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "When Trump announced Stefanik's appointment, his former national security adviser John Bolton told The Associated Press that he sees her as the new version of Trump's U.N. ambassador in his first administration \u2014 Nikki Haley. Haley went on to challenge him, unsuccessfully, for the GOP nomination last year.",
      "Stefanik \"wants to run for president in 2028,\" said Bolton, who also served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in President George W. Bush's administration. \"She realizes she has no foreign policy experience, so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador. She stays two years, and then away we go.\"",
      "Stefanik was asked about her views on the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere as well as the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs \u2014 all issues on the U.N. agenda.",
      "The United States pays about one-fifth of the U.N.'s regular budget, and she has already been questioned about her comments on cutting the U.N. budget and continuing support for its multiple agencies. Those tackle everything from health, education and migration to reproductive rights and nuclear proliferation.",
      "She responded by saying she is open to reviewing agencies to ensure \"that all of our taxpayer dollars are going to entities that function very well.\"",
      "But she also agreed with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons about supporting efforts to strengthen alliances, especially when it comes to China's influence at the world body. Trump has been skeptical of U.S. alliances, including NATO and defense partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, which the Biden team worked to shore up after taking over from Trump after his first term.",
      "Stefanik saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning last year of a trio of university presidents about antisemitism on their campuses, leading to two of their resignations \u2014 a performance Trump repeatedly praised.",
      "\"I was interested in this position because if you look at the antisemitic rot within the United Nations, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" Stefanik testified.",
      "Who is Elise Stefanik?",
      "Stefanik, 40, would be the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to the U.N. The New York Republican has served in a leadership position as Republican conference chair, and she was on the House Armed Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. And that skillset honed in Congress will serve her well, said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Alterman said Stefanik brings some of the most important qualities a U.N. ambassador can have \u2014 a close relationship with the president and an ability to communicate and execute his policies.",
      "Elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014, Stefanik was the youngest Republican woman to join Congress at the age of 30. She has easily won reelection in her upstate New York district ever since. As GOP conference chair, Stefanik has been the highest-ranking woman in the House.",
      "Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik was the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree, according to her office. She graduated from Harvard University, where she studied government.",
      "She has been very vocal about supporting Israel, especially since the Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage. It led to the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where a ceasefire that the U.S. helped broker has taken hold.",
      "In her 20s, she worked in the White House on President George W. Bush's Domestic Policy Council. Stefanik and her husband have one son.",
      "\"The most important part of being a representative is having a relationship to the president, being able to speak for the president, and speak for the administration's policies,\" Alterman said. \"I think she is very good at thinking about messaging, she understands the president's instincts and he likes her.\"",
      "\"And I think the political skill that you pick up being in Congress ends up being really helpful when you're working in the U.N.,\" Alterman continued. \"I mean, a lot of it is about building coalitions, about neutralizing opposition, about finding compromises. All those kinds of things are skills that Congress and other kinds of political experience is great for.\"",
      "Alterman said he thinks people \"underestimate her communication skills.\"",
      "\"I think she's very smart and savvy,\" Alterman said. \"And having an ambassador to the UN who can understand the impact of her words and actions advances the administration's agenda.\""

    "summary": "President Trump opted against deploying a blanket tariff against U.S. trading partners, but kept the heat on Canada and Mexico.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

Multiple sources told CBS News the decision was made in the past 24 hours.",
      "Bolton, an outspoken critic of President Trump, was granted Secret Service protection by the Biden administration in December 2021 for the first time since he served in the Trump White House. That decision followed a series of threats from Iran linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure, resulting in the assassination Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",

      "In 2022, Shahram Porsafi, a member of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was charged with a murder plot targeting Bolton. The Justice Department said in 2022 that the plot was \"likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani.\" The FBI offered a $300,000 reward for information leading to Porsafi's capture. Last September, the Biden administration announced a reward of up to $20 million for information on Porsafi.",
      "In his statement today, Bolton added, \"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination. The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"",
      "Bolton and another former national security adviser under Mr. Trump, Robert O'Brien, required ongoing U.S. Secret Service protection long after they left their positions, both due to potential threats from Iran. For nearly one year of protection, the total for both individuals was $12,280,324, a bill paid by U.S. taxpayers, according to reports filed to Congress by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and obtained by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last year through a Freedom of Information Act request.",

      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",

      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats.

      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",

Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015. Its goal is to prevent \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\" and try \"to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\"",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nationwide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation,\" Stiell said, according to Reuters, adding that there was still room for the new Trump administration to change course.",
      "\"The door remains open to the Paris agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,\" Stiell said.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing European Commission, said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Europe would \"stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\"",

      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered lower courts to review the case of the only woman on Oklahoma's death row over concerns that prosecutors' discussion of her sexual history rendered her trial unfair in the murder of her estranged husband.",
      "The court, over two dissenting votes, threw out a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the sentence and conviction of Brenda Andrew for her role in the killing of advertising executive Rob Andrew in 2001.",
      "James Pavatt, Andrew's lover, also is on death row after he was convicted of killing Andrew with a shotgun in the family garage in Oklahoma City.",
      "In an unsigned opinion, the justices ordered the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to re-examine Andrew's prosecution to determine if judges \"reviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial court's mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so 'unduly prejudicial' as to render her trial 'fundamentally unfair.'\"",
      "Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice\u00a0Neil Gorsuch, wrote that the state produced overwhelming evidence that Andrew participated in her husband's murder and would have left the conviction and death sentencing in place. Thomas said that the discussion of Andrews' sexual history and mothering was relevant because she described herself as a \"good mother\" as part of her defense.",
      "\"In presenting evidence to the contrary, the State was simply rebutting a point that Andrew had placed in issue, as it clearly is entitled to do,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Andrew argued that the state had a circumstantial case that it buttressed by presenting evidence about \"her sexual history, gender presentation, demeanor, and motherhood.\"",
      "At trial, the lawyers wrote, \"the prosecution relentlessly derided Ms. Andrew, using sexually-charged descriptions to cast her in the role of an unchaste wife,\" including a prosecutor's reference to her as a \"slut puppy\" and, during closing arguments, the display of her thong underwear.",
      "A three-judge appellate panel affirmed a state appellate ruling that sustained the conviction and death sentence. A dissenting judge on the 10th Circuit wrote that the evidence rendered the trial unfair.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Monday granted clemency to roughly 1,500 defendants who had been convicted of crimes on Jan. 6, 2021, following through on his longtime promise to absolve those who participated in the attack on the U.S. Capitol of wrongdoing.",
      "The president's action comes on his first day back in the White House and just hours after he was sworn in for a second term. Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to downplay the events of Jan. 6, when a mob of his supporters breached the Capitol in an effort to stop Congress from reaffirming Joe Biden's victory over him in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Mr. Trump extended clemency to those convicted of violent and serious crimes, including assaulting police officers and seditious conspiracy. He also ordered the attorney general to dismiss all pending indictments related to the Capitol riot, essentially eradicating the Biden Justice Department's massive effort to hold accountable those who participated in the assault.",
      "\"These are the hostages, approximately 1,500 for a pardon, full pardon,\" Mr. Trump said during remarks from the Oval Office. \"This is a big one.\"",
      "The president said he hopes those who remain incarcerated will be released immediately. His clemency includes six commutations, he said, though the proclamation released by the White House lists the names of 14 people and reduces their sentences to time served.",
      "\"These people have been destroyed,\" he said. \"What they've done to these people is outrageous. There's rarely been anything like it in the history of our country.\"",
      "Mr. Trump lambasted the judges overseeing cases stemming from the Jan. 6 attack and the prosecutors who brought charges as \"brutal.\"",
      "More than 1,600 people were charged as a result of their alleged conduct on Jan. 6, and at least 1,100 have had their cases adjudicated and received sentences, according to the Justice Department. More than 700 defendants completed their sentences or did not receive sentences of incarceration.",
      "More than 170 people were accused of using a deadly or dangerous weapon, such as a fire extinguisher or bear spray, against police officers, prosecutors have said.",
      "There are roughly 300 prosecutions that remain pending against defendants who have been charged, the Justice Department said earlier this month. Nearly 60% of those were charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement or obstructing those officers during a civil disorder, which are felonies.",
      "As of Tuesday morning, the acting U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia began seeking to end ongoing cases, citing Mr. Trump's order granting pardons and commutations for offenses related to the Capitol attack, court filings show.",
      "Many Jan. 6 defendants were charged with nonviolent misdemeanors, though some faced more serious offenses, like conspiring to use force to resist the transfer of power. But Mr. Trump's action appears to be sweeping \u2014 among those who received clemency is Enrique Tarrio, the former head of the far-right group the Proud Boys who was serving a 22-year sentence after he was convicted in May 2023 of charges including seditious conspiracy, his lawyer Nayid Hassan told CBS News. Tarrio was released from federal custody Tuesday after receiving a pardon from Mr. Trump, his attorney confirmed.",
      "Who had their sentences commuted?",
      "Trump commuted the sentences of more than a dozen people, according to his proclamation, including:",
      "Stewart Rhodes: The founder of the far-right group the Oath Keepers who was sentenced to 18 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other crimes. He was released from federal custody Tuesday, his lawyer confirmed;",
      "Kelly Meggs:\u00a0The leader of the Florida chapter of the Oath Keepers who was sentenced to 12 years behind bars;",

      "Dominic Pezzola: A Proud Boys member sentenced to 10 years in prison and was seen on video smashing a Capitol window with a riot shield;",
      "Jeremy Bertino: A Proud Boys member who entered a guilty plea to seditious conspiracy.",
      "The pardons cap a remarkable sequence of events that has played out since the 2020 election, when Mr. Trump mounted a scheme to overturn its results to hold onto power for a second term, as alleged by federal prosecutors and House investigators.",
      "That plot culminated in the Jan. 6 attack, as investigators said the president had spent weeks sowing doubt about the integrity of the 2020 election and urged his supporters in a speech outside the White House on Jan. 6 to \"fight like hell\" and \"stop the steal.\"",
      "The Justice Department has said more than 140 police officers were assaulted during the riot at the Capitol. The losses suffered as a result of the riot, including damage to the building and grounds, exceeded $2.8 million, according to the department.",
      "But four years after Mr. Trump allegedly attempted to subvert the transfer of power, he has returned to the White House after defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris. In one of her final acts as vice president, she presided over the joint session this year that confirmed Mr. Trump's victory.",
      "Keeping Mr. Trump's promise to grant reprieves to those charged in connection with the riot, several defendants sought to have court action in their cases delayed in the wake of the election.",
      "The authority to issue pardons for federal offenses rests exclusively with the president under the Constitution, but presidents typically work with the Justice Department's pardon attorney to consider requests for clemency.",
      "Pam Bondi, the president's pick for attorney general, was asked during her confirmation hearing last week whether she believed Jan. 6 defendants who were convicted of assaulting law enforcement should be given clemency, and said she would review each case and advise \"on a case-by-case basis\" if asked by the president to do so.",
      "\"I condemn any violence on a law enforcement officer in this country,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump's decision stirred anger from police officers who were injured during the Jan. 6 attack and testified before the House select committee that investigated the riot in 2022, as well as committee members themselves, some of whom are no longer in Congress.",
      "\"I have been betrayed by my country and I have been betrayed by those that supported Donald Trump,\" Michael Fanone, a former officer with the Metropolitan Police Department, told CNN. \"Whether you voted for him because he promised these pardons or for some other reason, you knew that this was coming and here we are.\"",
      "Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chaired the Jan. 6 select committee, said Mr. Trump cannot rewrite the history of Jan. 6.",
      "\"With these pardons and grants of clemency, President Trump has started his second term just like he finished his first: with lawless contempt for our justice system and our democracy,\" he said in a statement.",
      "Thompson said many of those who received pardons were convicted of violent crimes against police officers, and all tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power.",
      "\"Donald Trump, his enablers and all those who broke the law that day will never be able to erase the stain of their dishonor,\" he said. \"History will remember.\"",
      "Meanwhile, judges on the federal district court in Washington, where the cases involving Jan. 6 have been brought, have continued to resist efforts to lessen the severity of what transpired more than four years ago in the eyes of the public.",
      "\"No matter what ultimately becomes of the Capital Riots cases already concluded and still pending, the true story of what happened on January 6, 2021 will never change,\" Senior Judge Royce Lamberth, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, said during a December sentencing.",
      "Lamberth said that \"just as the president must make decisions on matters of clemency without interference from the coordinate branches, so too must our judiciary independently administer the laws and sentence convicted offenders.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked those who investigated the Jan. 6 assault and threatened to punish his political opponents, including former special counsel Jack Smith and the lawmakers who were on the House select committee that investigated the attack.",
      "In anticipation of possible retribution by Mr. Trump, Biden preemptively pardoned members of the Jan. 6 select committee and its staff, as well as Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the panel, during his final hours in office.",

      "A White House statement Monday night said the U.S. would withdraw \"due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "It also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",

      "The executive action was part of a slew of measures signed by Mr. Trump in the hours after he was sworn into a second term in office and is one of his first steps he has taken to target those he considers political opponents now that he has returned to the White House.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his order that the signers of the letter \"willfully weaponized the gravitas of the Intelligence Community to manipulate the political process and undermine our democratic institutions.\"",
      "\"This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country,\" the order states. \"And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the nation has been imperiled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden, was stolen. He continued to push his accusations about the last election as recently as Monday, when he told supporters after his inauguration that the 2020 contest was \"totally rigged.\"",
      "The letter at issue was signed by 51 former intelligence officials and released in October 2020 after the New York Post reported on emails recovered from a laptop computer discovered at a Delaware repair shop.

      "\"[T]he arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden's son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\" the officials wrote in their letter.",

      "Among those who signed the letter \u2014 and are named in Mr. Trump's order \u2014 are former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former CIA and NSA Director Michael Hayden and former CIA Director John Brennan. Two of the 51 signatories have since died.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 10:32:49 -0500",
    "summary": "The first volume of special counsel Jack Smith's report on the 2020 election case against President Trump was released last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in South Florida blocked the Justice Department from giving lawmakers the portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's report that deals with his investigation into President Trump's handling of classified documents.",
      "In a scathing rebuke of the Justice Department's proposal, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in a 14-page order\u00a0she is granting a request from Mr. Trump's co-defendants to keep the report from the heads of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Walt Nauta, an aide to Mr. Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, asked Cannon to block its release earlier this month.",
      "\"Never before has the Department of Justice, prior to the conclusion of criminal proceedings against a defendant \u2014 and absent a litigation-specific reason as appropriate in the case itself \u2014 sought to disclose outside the Department a report prepared by a Special Counsel containing substantive and voluminous case information. Until now,\" she wrote on Tuesday.",
      "Smith, who resigned as special counsel earlier this month, submitted to former Attorney General Merrick Garland a two-volume report on his investigations involving Mr. Trump. The first volume, related to his investigation into the president's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was released to the public days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "But Garland said the second volume, about the classified documents case, would not be available to the American people because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. Instead, the attorney general said the report would only be available to the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information about it.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira sought to completely shield the full report, arguing its disclosure would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Cannon last week cleared the way for the Justice Department to release the first volume, on the 2020 election case, but ordered a hearing on whether the second volume should be available to lawmakers.",
      "She also reviewed that part of the report herself, and said in her order that it contains \"detailed and voluminous discovery information\" covered by a protective order issued at an earlier stage in the case. Cannon wrote that Garland's proposal would risk prejudicing the ongoing case.",
      "\"The bare wishes of one attorney general with 'limited time' in office to comply with a non-existent 'historical practice' of releasing special counsel reports in the pendency of criminal proceedings is not a valid reason,\" she wrote. \"And surely it does not override the obvious constitutional interests of defendants in this action and this court's duty to protect the integrity of this proceeding.\"",
      "The judge, appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, rebuffed the Justice Department's assertions that there is interest by Congress in the unreleased portion of the report, noting there has been no subpoena for its release and no record of any lawmaker seeking to review it. There is also no pending legislation on the subject, she said.",
      "Cannon wrote that statements by prosecutors about Garland's desire to disclose the report to the four leaders of the Judiciary Committees \"do not reflect well on the department.\"",
      "\"[T]he Department offers no valid justification for the purportedly urgent desire to release to members of Congress case information in an ongoing criminal proceeding,\" she said.",
      "The judge also said that given the \"very strong public interest\" in the case involving Nauta and de Oliveira, there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that review by lawmakers would lead to the public dissemination of all or part of the report involving the classified documents investigation.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Smith\u00a0brought charges against Mr. Trump, alongside Nauta and de Oliveira, for allegedly holding onto classified documents after leaving office the first time in January 2021 and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation. The president and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "But last July, Cannon dismissed the indictment\u00a0on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed special counsel. The former special counsel appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected president last November, Smith asked the appeals court to drop the case against Mr. Trump, citing longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. The 11th Circuit agreed to do so, but the case is moving forward with Nauta and de Oliveira as co-defendants.",

      "\"Reproductive health care, including access to birth control and safe and legal abortion care, is an essential part of your health and well-being,\" a statement on the website read. \"While Roe v. Wade was overturned, abortion remains legal in many states, and other reproductive health care services remain protected by law.\"",
      "The site affirmed that most employer-based health plans and private health insurance plans are required to cover certain prescription birth control methods under the Affordable Care Act, which Trump has made calls to repeal. It also displayed a list of other services covered by most insurance plans, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, prenatal care and HIV screenings.",
      "The site reiterated that while abortion legality varies by state, Mifepristone, in a regimen with misoprostol \u2014 otherwise known as a medication abortion \u2014 has been approved by the FDA and is safe and effective when used correctly.",
      "It was not clear exactly when the site went down but it had been active as recently as Jan. 15.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Trump administration for clarification on why the site was down, but has not heard back.",
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was tapped by Trump to oversee the Department of Health and Human Services, has flip-flopped on his public stance regarding abortion. He said on Facebook last year that \"abortion should be legal up until a certain number of weeks, and restricted thereafter,\" but also wrote that \"every abortion is a tragedy,\" calling for the reduction of abortions \"by better supporting mothers, parents and families.\"",
      "In 2023, he expressed to an NBC News reporter that he would support a national ban on abortion after the first three months of pregnancy, but then hours later a spokesperson for Kennedy said that he \"does not support legislation banning abortion,\" the outlet reported.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, has said that abortion decisions should be left to the states and that he would veto a federal abortion ban while also repeatedly taking credit for the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade.",
      "According to the Guttmacher Institute, 12 states currently have a total abortion ban and in four states abortion is banned after six weeks, when most women are not yet aware they are pregnant. According to a CBS News poll, most Americans continue to favor abortion being legal in all or most cases."

      "Vaillant says climate change is making disasters like the wind-driven L.A. fires even fiercer. \"We can expect fires of this intensity, and worse, in the future,\" he said. \"The types of fires we've seen over the past ten years are qualitatively different from the previous hundred years.\"",
      "\"The types of fires are different?\" I asked. \"How has fire changed?\"",
      "\"In a number of ways. The most potent and frightening way, the most obvious to the layperson, people like us, is it moves faster and with greater intensity. When you talk to any firefighter with any sense of history, they are seeing different [fire] behavior that is, in many cases, un-fightable.\"",
      "And Vaillant says the cause is something science has been telling us for decades: the CO2 that our combustion engines keep pumping into the atmosphere. \"We don't feel it; we don't smell it; we don't notice it,\" he said. \"But if you were to take the car engine that brought me here and set it up on the floor here and fired it up, we would go deaf, and then we would die from its emissions.\u00a0 And that's under the hood of every internal combustion engine car. And there are hundreds of millions of them. So, the emissions from fire, these trillions of fires that we make every day, has created this artificially warm climate.\"",

      "Scientists like Kalmus have been warning the world about impending climate disaster for years now. But on January 6, as the fire closed in on Altadena, perhaps the most effective warning came from an amateur meteorologist.",
      "Edgar McGregor has been picking up trash in Altadena every day for more than five years. He's also into meteorology, and runs a Facebook page about weather. Days before the fires even started, he warned his Facebook followers about dangerous conditions, and on January 6, he posted a video telling them to drop everything and get out of town.",
      "\"I said, 'Get out,'\" McGregor explained. \"I stood in the middle of my street at home, filmed myself with the mountains on fire behind me and told people, 'This is serious. Get your Social Security cards. Get the deed to your home. Get out. Like, this is the Big One. I'm not joking around. This is not gonna blow over.'\"",

      "Siebert, who had never met McGregor in person, embraced him when she was introduced. \"I'm so appreciative of you,\" she said. \"You saved my family and you saved so many people. So, thank you.\"",
      "The fires, experts say, are a warning on a much bigger scale, that the Earth will continue to get drier and more volatile unless we do something about climate change. But of course, warnings only work when people listen.",
      "I asked Vaillant, \"Have we just pushed Nature too far?\"",
      "\"The upside to all of this is, Nature is inviting us, sternly, to reengage,\" he replied. \"It's only going to get hotter. And so, Nature is saying, 'Wake up! We are in this together.' It behooves all of us to focus on the real causes, and to understand that this really can happen to us, to us, to you and to me, not just to people we know, or people on TV.\"",

    "summary": "Scientists analyzing 2,000-year-old DNA have revealed that a Celtic society in the southern U.K. during the Iron Age was centered around women, a study said.",
    "story": [
      "Female family ties were at the heart of social networks in Celtic society in Britain before the Roman invasion, a new analysis suggests.",
      "Genetic evidence from a late Iron Age cemetery shows that women were closely related while unrelated men tended to come into the community from elsewhere, likely after marriage.",
      "An examination of ancient DNA recovered from 57 graves in Dorset in southwest England shows that two-thirds of the individuals were descended from a single maternal lineage. The cemetery was used from around 100 B.C. to 200 A.D.",
      "\"That was really jaw-dropping \u2014 it's never been observed before in European prehistory,\" said study co-author Lara Cassidy, a geneticist at Trinity College Dublin.",
      "The findings, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, suggest that women stayed in the same circles throughout life \u2014 maintaining social networks and likely inheriting or managing land and property.",
      "Meanwhile \"it's your husband who is coming in as a relative stranger, dependent on a wife's family for land and livelihood,\" said Cassidy.",
      "This pattern \u2014 called matrilocality \u2014 is historically rare.",
      "\"Such a matrilocal pattern is undescribed in European prehistory, but when we compare mitochondrial haplotype variation among European archaeological sites spanning six millennia, British Iron Age cemeteries stand out as having marked reductions in diversity driven by the presence of dominant matrilines,\" the authors write in an article accompanying the study.",
      "Archaeologists studying grave sites in Britain and Europe have previously only detected the opposite pattern \u2014 women leaving their homes to join their husband's family group \u2014 in other ancient time periods, from the neolithic to the early Medieval period, said Guido Gnecchi-Ruscone at the Max Planck Institute in Germany, who was not part of the study.",
      "In studies of pre-industrial societies from around 1800 to the present, anthropologists found that men join their wives' extended family households only 8% of the time, said Cassidy.",
      "But archaeologists already knew there was something special about the role of women in Iron Age Britain. A patchwork of tribes with closely related languages and art styles \u2014 sometimes referred to as Celtic \u2014 lived in England before the Roman invasion in 43 A.D. Valuable items have been found buried with Celtic women, and Roman writers, including Julius Caesar, wrote with disdain about their relative independence and fighting prowess.",
      "The pattern of strong female kinship connections that the researchers found does not necessarily imply that women also held formal positions of political power, called matriarchy.",
      "But it does suggest that women had some control of land and property, as well as strong social support, making Britain's Celtic society \"more egalitarian than the Roman world,\" said study co-author and Bournemouth University archaeologist Miles Russell.",
      "\"When the Romans arrived, they were astonished to find women occupying positions of power,\"\u00a0 Russell said.",
      "Some had doubted these accounts, suggesting \"that the Romans exaggerated the liberties of British women to paint a picture of an untamed society,\" he told AFP.",
      "\"But archaeology, and now genetics, implies women were influential in many spheres of Iron Age life,\" he said.",
      "\"Indeed, it is possible that maternal ancestry was the primary shaper of group identities.\"",

      "The Starship, meanwhile, continued toward space on the power of its six engines. But about eight-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, telemetry shared on SpaceX's webcast showed the engines shutting down in a staggered fashion before data suddenly froze and stopped updating.",
      "Numerous photos and videos posted on social media showed smoking debris trails fanning out from a fireball in the late afternoon sky in a scene reminiscent of the shuttle Columbia's breakup in 2003 and the Russian Mir space station's intentional re-entry and disintegration in 2001.",
      "The mishap Thursday is not expected to impact SpaceX's commercial operations. The company dominates the commercial launch industry with its partially reusable Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets launched from Florida and California and those boosters do not share any common elements with the Starship.",
      "But Musk views the Super Heavy-Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built, as the future of the company, with both stages designed to fly themselves to rocket-powered landings for rapid refurbishment and re-launch, a key element in the company's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "SpaceX is in the process of ramping up test flights to quickly verify performance, test new ideas, identify problem areas and implement fixes in downstream flights.",
      "How the FAA-mandated investigation might affect the test schedule is not yet known.",
      "\"A mishap investigation is designed to enhance public safety, determine the root cause of the event and identify corrective actions to avoid it from happening again,\" the FAA said.",
      "\"The FAA will be involved in every step of the SpaceX-led mishap investigation process and must approve SpaceX's final report, including any corrective actions.

      "SpaceX launched its huge Super Heavy-Starship mega rocket on its seventh test flight Thursday, successfully \"catching\" the first stage booster back at its firing stand but losing its new-generation Starship upper stage spacecraft, which apparently broke up as it was reaching space. Falling debris from the destroyed Starship briefly delayed airline traffic out of Miami, Florida, federal officials said.",
      "Telemetry from the Starship froze eight minutes and 27 seconds after launch following unexpected engine shutdowns or failures. SpaceX later confirmed the ship's destruction in a posting on X, using a tongue-in-cheek description:",
      "\"Starship experienced a rapid unscheduled disassembly during its ascent burn. Teams will continue to review data from today's flight test to better understand root cause. With a test like this, success comes from what we learn, and today's flight will help us improve Starship's reliability.\"",
      "\"We (lost) all communications with the ship,\" a SpaceX launch commentator said of the Starship. \"That is essentially telling us we had an anomaly with the upper stage.\" A moment later, he confirmed: \"We did lose the upper stage.\"",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration also reported that airline traffic at Miami International and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International airports was delayed up to an hour due to what it described as a \"rocket launch anomaly.\"",
      "The FAA in a statement said it \"briefly slowed and diverted aircraft around the area where space vehicle debris was falling.\" It said normal operations had resumed.",
      "\"The FAA is aware an anomaly occurred during the SpaceX Starship Flight 7 mission that launched from Boca Chica, Texas, on Jan. 16,\" the agency said in a follow-up statement, adding that it is \"assessing the operation.\"",
      "Video posted to social media and verified by CBS News showed debris from the Starship falling in the area of Turks and Caicos Islands in the Caribbean.",
      "pic.twitter.com/cuVfkNvDUK",
      "SpaceX's billionaire owner Elon Musk later hinted at a possible cause, posting to his X platform: \"Preliminary indication is that we had an oxygen/fuel leak in the cavity above the ship engine firewall that was large enough to build pressure in excess of the vent capacity. Apart from obviously double-checking for leaks, we will add fire suppression to that volume and probably increase vent area.\"",
      "In a news release, SpaceX said that \"initial data indicates a fire developed in the aft section of the ship, leading to a rapid unscheduled disassembly with debris falling into the Atlantic Ocean within the predefined hazard areas.\"",
      "SpaceX said that anyone who finds what they think is debris should call local authorities or the company's debris hotline at 1-866-623-0234.",
      "The gargantuan rocket blasted off from SpaceX's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight test facility on the Gulf Coast at 5:37 p.m. Eastern Time, firing up 33 methane-burning Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust.",
      "Gulping 40,000 pounds of propellant per second, the booster climbed away from its launch stand and gracefully arced over to the east atop a long jet of flaming exhaust visible for dozens of miles around.",
      "Two minutes and 40 seconds after liftoff, the Super Heavy fell away and the Starship continued the climb to space on the power of its six Raptor engines.",
      "The booster, meanwhile, flipped around, re-ignited several engines to reverse course and headed back toward Boca Chica where the unique mechanical arms on the rocket's launch gantry were open and waiting.",
      "Plummeting tail first back to Earth, the Super Heavy re-ignited its engines, tilting as they steered it to the pad, and then settled straight down between the chopsticks, which smoothly closed to capture their quarry in mid air.",
      "The first such catch last October was successful, a jaw-dropping sight to thousands of cheering residents and tourists. But the Super Heavy used for the next such flight a month later was diverted to a Gulf of Mexico splashdown because of launch damage to sensors on the tower that were needed to help guide the descending booster into position.",
      "New sensors with have more robust shielding were put in place to eliminate such damage and SpaceX engineers are optimistic they'll soon be recovering Super Heavy boosters with the same regularity they've demonstrated with the company's workhorse Falcon 9 rockets, a key element in SpaceX's drive to lower launch costs.",
      "In keeping with the reusability theme, the Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines included one that flew on a previous test flight to demonstrate its ability to fly multiple missions.",
      "The bulk of the upgrades tested Thursday were built into what SpaceX called a \"new generation\" Starship. Two minutes after the booster \"landed,\" the upper stage reached space.",
      "But the loss of telemetry left flight controllers in the dark about what might have happened in the final stages of the ascent.",
      "For these initial test flights, the Starships do not attempt to reach orbit. Instead, they loop halfway around the planet and descend belly-first through a hellish blaze of atmospheric friction before flipping nose up for a tail-first, rocket-powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean.",
      "For Thursday's flight, major test objectives included restarting a Raptor engine in space and the deployment of 10 dummy Starlink mockups to test a new satellite delivery system that works a bit like a Pez candy dispenser. Starships are expected to launch thousands of Starlinks after the rocket is operational.",
      "Among the other upgrades were smaller stabilizing fins, repositioned to reduce their exposure to re-entry heating, an improved propulsion avionics system, redesigned fuel feed lines and a 25% increase in propellant volume to improve performance.",
      "The redesigned avionics system includes a more powerful flight computer, new antennas that combine signals from Starlink and GPS navigation satellites, \"smart batteries\" and power units to drive two dozen high-voltage actuators and redesigned navigation sensors.",
      "SpaceX also added additional cameras, with more than 30 on board to provide direct views of critical systems using operational Starlink satellites to stream real-time video and data to the ground.",
      "While the spacecraft is designed to be fully reusable, SpaceX has not yet made any attempts to capture a returning Starship or, for that matter, a Falcon 9 upper stage.",
      "But Thursday's test flight featured multiple experiments to test a variety of heat shield improvements, including metallic tiles and one with active cooling, along with dummy Starship catch fittings, to learn more about how they will respond to re-entry heating.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 09:21:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite losing its booster during a landing attempt, the upper stage reached orbit as planned.",
    "story": [
      "Shrugging off bad weather, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin launched its powerful New Glenn rocket on its maiden flight early Thursday, lighting up a cloudy overnight sky as it climbed away from Cape Canaveral in a high-stakes bid to compete with Elon Musk's industry-leading SpaceX.",
      "Like SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9, the New Glenn's first stage was designed to fly itself to a landing on a Blue Origin recovery ship after boosting the upper stage out of the lower atmosphere. Reusability is a key element in Bezos' drive to compete with Musk on the high frontier.",
      "The booster did it's job propelling the upper stage into the lower reaches of space. But during its descent to a planned landing on the recovery ship Jacklyn, named after Bezos' mother, telemetry and video from the rocket froze.",
      "\"We may very well have lost the booster,\" a company commentator said.",
      "The company later confirmed that. But recovering the first stage was always a secondary objective. The New Glenn's upper stage reached orbit without any apparent problems, achieving the primary goal of the flight.",
      "\"We did it! Orbital,\" company CEO Dave Limp said on X. \"Great night for Team Blue. On to spring and trying again on the landing.\"",
      "As for the booster, Limp said \"we knew landing our booster ... on the first try was an ambitious goal. We'll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring. Thank you to all of Team Blue for this incredible milestone.\"",
      "The mission got underway at 2:03 a.m. EST when the New Glenn's seven methane-burning BE-4 engines at the base of the first stage roared to life with a rush of brilliant flame and a ground-shaking roar.",
      "Smoothly accelerating as it consumed propellants and lost weight, the  New Glenn streaked away from pad 36 at the Cape Canaveral Space Force  Station atop a brilliant blue-white plume, putting on a spectacular show for  cheering Blue Origin employees, area residents and tourists.",
      "The launch came a week later than originally planned because of rough weather in the booster landing zone and, once, because of a minor technical problem. But it appeared to be clear sailing Thursday as the rocket climbed away and disappeared from view.",
      "Three minutes and 10 seconds after liftoff, the rocket's first stage engines shut down, triggering stage separation and ignition of the two hydrogen-burning BE-3U engines powering the rocket's second stage.",
      "As the upper stage continued the climb to orbit, the first stage briefly coasted upward before arcing over and falling back to Earth, homing in on the Jacklyn, which was standing by several hundred miles downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. NASA's WB-57 photo-reconnaissance jet was flying nearby, documenting the flight with high-resolution cameras.",
      "Three engines re-ignited as planned to slow the booster for re-entry but during the burn, video showing one of the engines froze and on-screen telemetry stopped while showing an altitude of 84,226 feet and a velocity of 4,285 mph. Whether the rocket exploded or suffered some other malfunction and crashed into the sea was not immediately known.",
      "But company officials said before launch that they would learn from any anomalies and press ahead with another flight in the next few months.",
      "\"We have another one (in production), and it'll be coming off the line here shortly,\" Limp told CBS News earlier this week. \"So we'll fly (again) either way in the spring.\"",
      "While SpaceX tested its Falcon 9 landing system with ocean splashdowns before attempting an actual landing, Blue Origin opted to make the attempt on the rocket's maiden flight. That was based in part on the company's experience launching and landing its sub-orbital New Shepard rocket, used to carry space tourists, researchers and payloads on brief up-and-down flights out of the lower atmosphere.",
      "Even so, company officials acknowledged the challenge, naming the New Glenn first stage \"So You're Telling Me There's A Chance.\"",
      "\"There's no question that it's a bit audacious to try to land it the first time,\" Limp said before launch.",
      "But the first stage landing was just one of several major objectives. The primary goal of the flight was to put the upper stage into orbit, along with a Blue Origin-designed spacecraft known as the Blue Ring Pathfinder. A sort of space tug, the Blue Ring can host or deploy multiple satellites in different orbits while providing on-board computer support and even servicing.",
      "For its initial flight, the Blue Ring was to remain attached to the New Glenn's upper stage throughout the planned five-hour 50-minute mission.",
      "The flight plan called for two firings of the upper stage engines, with the second coming about an hour after liftoff, to put the vehicle and the attached Blue Ring Pathfinder in an elliptical orbit with a high point of about 12,000 miles and a low point of around 1,500 miles.",
      "Blue Ring is equipped with roll-out solar arrays stretching 144 feet. It features 13 ports for hosted and deployable payloads and can accommodate satellites or other instruments weighing up to 2.5 tons on its upper deck.",
      "There are no such payloads on the initial flight, but the spacecraft's systems will undergo a series of tests to learn more about how the craft performs in space.",
      "Regardless of the results of Thursday's mission, Blue Origin will face an uphill battle with SpaceX, which currently dominates the commercial launch market.",
      "Musk had kind words about the launch in a post on his X platform, saying, \"Congratulations on reaching orbit on the first attempt!\"",
      "SpaceX began launching its Falcon 9 rockets in 2010 and since then has fired off 436 Falcon 9-family missions with only two in-flight failures.",
      "Complicating the picture for Blue Origin, SpaceX is in the process of testing a gargantuan, fully reusable rocket known as the Super Heavy-Starship. It is the most powerful rocket ever built, and once operational is expected to play a major role in launching payloads to low-Earth orbit, the moon and beyond.",
      "SpaceX plans to launch a Super Heavy-Starship from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and test center on Thursday at 5 p.m. EST.",
      "After boosting the Starship out of the lower atmosphere, the Super Heavy booster is designed to fly back to its launch pad, where giant mechanical arms would attempt to pluck it out of mid-air. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, would loop around the planet, launching 10 mockup Starlink satellites before a simulated landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "Some 225 Falcon 9 flights have launched 7,700 Starlink internet satellites since 2019, with thousands more planned. The company already has millions of customers around the world, giving it a formidable head start over potential competitors.",
      "How Blue Origin and other rocket builders will complete with SpaceX, it's Falcon-family rockets and the Super Heavy-Starship remains to be seen.",
      "But Blue Origin already has a backlog of satellites awaiting launch on its New Glenn and is awaiting certification to launch high-priority national security payloads, NASA probes and other civilian satellites.",
      "Amazon plans to launch more than 3,232 broadband relay stations known as Project Kuiper to provide space-based internet services in direct competition with SpaceX's Starlink.",
      "Blue Origin says it has booked 80 launches using New Glenn rockets and boosters provided by the European consortium Arianespace, United Launch Alliance and even SpaceX to get the data relay stations into orbit.",
      "\"I'm very bullish about space in general,\" Limp said. \"I think there's going to be lots of winners in this segment. It might be SpaceX; I think Blue will be there. But I also believe there's going to be new companies that we've never even heard of yet. There's some entrepreneur out there that hasn't started a space company that's going to be at the table.\"",

      "It was so much better that the 8th grade lacrosse goalie made the radical choice to get a flip phone, giving him the ability to communicate without all the smart features \u2014 and distractions.",
      "A growing number of experts are sounding the alarm about increased screen time and the effect it has on kids and teens. In a 2023 advisory on social media use and mental health, former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy recommended creating \"tech-free zones\" and encouraging kids to \"foster in-person friendships.\" Meanwhile, several states have taken steps to ban cellphones in schools.",
      "Swapping smartphones for flip phones",
      "Ben said he used to average up to five hours of screen time per day. Once he switched to a flip phone, it went down to about 30 minutes. So, CBS News asked four of Ben's friends, Carson, Ranita, Jamison and Maya \u2014 all 8th graders in New Jersey \u2014 to try flip phones for a week. Maya said her average screen time at the beginning of the week was more than 10 hours, spent mostly watching TV and on Tiktok.",
      "They were curious but skeptical about the experiment. Jamison said he wasn't doing as well as he wanted to in school and thought his phone use could be a \"big factor in that.\" Although Ranita plays three sports, she admitted wasting time on her phone, watching 30 minutes of scrolling turn into an hour without noticing. Carson agreed to participate, but the avid basketball player was nervous. Maya, who loves studying English and just started rowing, was hoping the trial would help her sleep better at night.",
      "The day CBS News sat down with the teens and took their iPhones and iPads and gave them flip phones, the reactions were a mix of laughing, shaking and confusion. They spent time gathered around the kitchen table with Ben teaching them how to use these foreign devices, including learning how to text without a \"modern\" keyboard.",
      "They left with instructions to try and stay in the spirit of the experiment, not using friends or parents phones as crutches \u2014 and of course the promise they'd get their smart devices back in a week.",
      "Carson didn't make it and asked for his phone back within 24 hours, saying he sat staring at the wall until he had basketball practice after school. The others stuck it out, sending in mostly positive reviews in video diaries taken on their parents phones throughout the experiment.",
      "\"I've been sleeping a lot better, a lot less tired during the day,\" Maya said.",
      "Jamison said it was helping him finish his homework faster. Ranita reported that she was frustrated not having her digital wallet and felt other conveniences of her phone were missing.",
      "Screen time linked to anxiety and depression in teens",
      "Experts' concerns about increased screen time are not unfounded. Half of American teenagers aged 12 to 18 had four hours or more of daily screen time during a period between July 2021 and December 2023. Almost 23% had three hours of daily screen time, 17.8% had two hours, 6.1% had one hour, and only 3% had less than one hour, according to a report from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.",
      "Teens getting four or more hours of screen time each day were more likely to experience anxiety and depression, the report found.",
      "Living life outside screens",
      "Seven days later, the experiment was over. The teens noticed a difference \u2014 and so did their parents.",

      "Jamison's mom, Amy Lita, said her son had hundreds of messages from group chats when he went back to his smartphone, \"but he thought it was all just nonsense and didn't feel like he missed out.\"",
      "Maya said she learned the importance of living life outside of your screen. Her mom, Lani Padilla, hopes the experience can help them do things differently going forward.",
      "\"I'm hoping it plants a seed to think a little more critically about how she uses her smartphone \u2014 and me, too,\" Padilla said.",

To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Trump on Sunday posted on social media that he would restore TikTok, first writing \"SAVE TIKTOK\" and then vowing to issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before the law takes effect.

      "The Supreme Court's decision said the\u00a0divest-or-ban law\u00a0does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

      "\"We can have an app that protects Americans,\" Waltz said. \"And I could tell you, I wouldn't want the FBI or the U.S. government monitoring every keystroke or seeing every password, nor would we want the Chinese Communist Party. But we also want an app that 170 million Americans clearly really enjoy and that we were able to get our message out during the Trump campaign in a very powerful way.\"",
      "TikTok had said Friday it would \"be forced to go dark\" beginning Sunday unless the Biden administration assured service providers that the law would not be enforced. The White House called the appeal \"a stunt\" and said the company should bring up its concerns with the Trump administration.",
      "\"We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump Administration takes office on Monday,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said.",
      "Internationally on Sunday, the TikTok app remained accessible, and there was no indication for international users that it had gone dark in the U.S. It was still possible to view and interact with American accounts, and there was no obvious official signposting that U.S. users' access had been restricted.",
      "Even if Trump declines to enforce the ban, the law would still be on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. Trump told NBC News on Saturday that he was considering an option to extend the deadline for the law to go into effect.",
      "\"The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,\" he said in the phone interview, adding, \"if I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.\"",
      "The law includes a provision that allows for a short-term extension if there is a sale in progress.",
      "During Supreme Court arguments on Jan. 10, Noel Francisco, a lawyer for TikTok, warned that the platform would shut down when the law went into effect, explaining that it would be \"extraordinarily difficult\" for a divestiture to occur under any timeline because the Chinese government opposes a sale of the algorithm that powers the platform by tailoring video recommendations to each user.",
      "\"As I understand it, we go dark,\" Francisco said.",
      "But even if there is an eventual sale that did not include TikTok's algorithm, it would take \"many years\" for a new team of engineers to rebuild it and it would be a \"fundamentally different platform,\" according to Francisco. He said the company's inability to share any user data with ByteDance under the law would cut off American users from viewing content from other parts of the world and vice versa.",
      "The bipartisan law was tucked into a foreign assistance package that swiftly passed Congress and was signed by President Biden last April. TikTok and ByteDance challenged the law the next month, calling it \"an extraordinary and unconstitutional assertion of power\" based on \"speculative and analytically flawed concerns about data security and content manipulation\" that would suppress the speech of millions of Americans.",
      "In a December ruling, a federal appeals court upheld the statute, saying the U.S. government \"acted solely to protect that freedom from a foreign adversary nation and to limit that adversary's ability to gather data on people in the United States.\" The appeals court later denied TikTok's bid to delay the law from taking effect, pending a Supreme Court review.",
      "The Supreme Court moved with extraordinary speed to take up the case after TikTok requested the justices order a temporary pause. The court issued its opinion a week after hearing arguments and two days before the law took effect.",
      "\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community. But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok's data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary,\" the court's opinion said.",
      "The justices cited Congress' finding that companies can be required to turn over data to the Chinese government under Chinese law.",
      "\"The government had good reason to single out TikTok,\" the court said.",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar noted during arguments that there's \"nothing permanent or irrevocable that happens\" on Sunday. The law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok if there is a sale after the date.",
      "\"Congress expected we might see something like a game of chicken. ByteDance saying, we can't do it, China will never let us do it. But when push comes to shove and these restrictions take effect, I think it will fundamentally change the landscape with respect to what ByteDance is willing to consider,\" Prelogar said.",
      "In a video statement after the Supreme Court issued its decision, TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew appeared confident that the app would have a future under Trump. He thanked the incoming president for his commitment to finding a solution that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. \"for years to come.\"",
      "Trump, who tried to ban TikTok during his first term over national security concerns, said Friday that he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok. A Chinese summary of the call did not mention that it was a topic of discussion.",
      "Barring a sale or Congress overturning the law, there's no long-term certainty about TikTok's future in the U.S. If Trump or a future president declines to enforce the law, companies like Apple and Google could still face steep fines in the future.",

So TikTok and other companies should take up any concerns with them.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the TikTok ban and how we got here:",
      "Why did Congress want to ban TikTok?",
      "U.S. officials have repeatedly warned that TikTok threatens national security because the Chinese government could use it as a vehicle to spy on Americans or covertly influence the U.S. public by amplifying or suppressing certain content.",
      "The concern is warranted, they said, because Chinese national security laws require organizations to cooperate with intelligence gathering. FBI Director Christopher Wray told House Intelligence Committee members last year that the Chinese government could compromise Americans' devices through the software.",
      "As the House took up the divest-or-ban law in April 2024, Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, compared it to a \"spy balloon in Americans' phones.\" Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware, said that lawmakers learned in classified briefings \"how rivers of data are being collected and shared in ways that are not well-aligned with American security interests.\"",
      "\"Why is it a security threat?\" Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Friday. \"If you have TikTok on your phone currently, it can track your whereabouts, it can read your text messages, it can track your keystrokes. It has access to your phone records.\"",
      "If the Chinese government gets its hands on that information, \"it's not just a national security threat, it's a personal security threat,\" Hawley said.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. The Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Though the divest-or-ban law passed with bipartisan support, some lawmakers have been critical of the measure, agreeing with TikTok that it infringes on Americans' free speech rights.",
      "\"Most of the reasons the government banned it were based on accusations, not proof,\" Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said Friday. \"[TikTok has] never been tried and found guilty of sharing information with the communist government.\"",
      "Others have changed their tune as the deadline for a ban neared, including Trump, who tried to ban the app with an executive order during his first term that was struck down in the courts.",
      "\"The irony in all of this is that Donald Trump was the first one to point out there's a problem,\" Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. Warner said the Trump administration \"did a great job of convincing me and overwhelming members of Congress\" about the risks.",
      "TikTok has its day at the Supreme Court",
      "During arguments before the Supreme Court on Jan. 10, TikTok's lawyer did not deny the potential national security risks as the justices appeared critical of the company's legal challenge.",
      "\"I think Congress and the president were concerned that China was accessing information about millions of Americans, tens of millions of Americans, including teenagers, people in their 20s, that they would use that information over time to develop spies, to turn people, to blackmail people, people who a generation from now will be working in the FBI or the CIA or in the State Department,\" Justice Brett Kavanaugh said. \"Is that not a realistic assessment by Congress and the president of the risks here?\"",
      "Noel Francisco, who represented TikTok, responded, \"I'm not disputing the risks. I'm disputing the means that they have chosen.\"",
      "Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar asserted that TikTok collects \"unprecedented amounts\" of personal data that would be \"incredibly valuable\" to the Chinese government by giving it \"a powerful tool for harassment, recruitment and espionage.\"",
      "\"For years, the Chinese government has sought to build detailed profiles about Americans, where we live and work, who our friends and coworkers are what our interests are and what our vices are,\" she said, citing major data breaches that the U.S. has attributed to China over the last decade, including the hack of the Office of Personnel Management that compromised the personal information of millions of federal employees.",
      "The Supreme Court's TikTok decision",
      "In defending the law before the Supreme Court, the Justice Department pointed to two main national security justifications: countering China's collection of data from TikTok's 170 million U.S. users and its purported ability to manipulate content on the app to further its geopolitical interests.",
      "The Supreme Court's unanimous ruling hinged on the first justification: that China, through the app and its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, can amass vast amounts of information from American users. The justices found that Congress did not violate the First Amendment by taking action to address that threat. Congress, it said, \"had good reason to single out TikTok for special treatment.\"",
      "The court refrained from backing the government's interest in stopping China's purported covert manipulation of content, which the Biden administration had cited as a national security justification for the law.",
      "\"One man's 'covert content manipulation' is another's 'editorial discretion,'\" Gorsuch wrote in an opinion concurring in judgment. \"Journalists, publishers, and speakers of all kinds routinely make less-than-transparent judgments about what stories to tell and how to tell them.

      "Small businesses and content creators are bracing for impact if TikTok goes dark this weekend after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a\u00a0law banning the app unless it is sold by its China-based parent company.",
      "Jessica Simon, the founder of Mississippi Candle Company, on Friday said she was \"grieving\" over what she expects to be a steep decline in sales if TikTok is banned from app stores in the U.S. as early as Sunday. She said that between 90% and 98% of her company's sales come either directly or indirectly from TikTok.",
      "\"That much of our business comes from people seeing our products on TikTok and buying it through our TikTok shop, or coming to our website,\" Simon told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I am still processing the news.\"",
      "Simon, who first started making candles on her stovetop, said the TikTok shop she launched in 2023 \"changed our lives.\"",
      "Despite such concerns, the nation's highest court declined to block or delay the potential ban if TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, fails to divest the platform. The Justice Department, which had supported the law, applauded the ruling.",
      "\"The Court's decision enables the Justice Department to prevent the Chinese government from weaponizing TikTok to undermine America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a\u00a0statement. \"Authoritarian regimes should not have unfettered access to millions of Americans' sensitive data.\"",
      "Jeffrey Fisher, a lawyer who represented TikTok content creators in the app's case before the Supreme Court, also urged President Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland in a letter on Friday to delay implementation of the law.",
      "\"The law is scheduled to go into effect literally on the eve of the inauguration of President-elect Trump, who recently asked the Supreme Court for the same relief because he wants to work on this issue directly,\" Fisher wrote. \"He should be given that chance. Otherwise, the Act would significantly burden the speech rights of over 170 million Americans and would cause substantial and avoidable disruption to the third-party providers that may be subject to severe penalties if they continue to provide TikTok to its millions of users.\"",

      "\"Unless the Biden administration immediately provides a definitive statement to satisfy the most critical service providers assuring non-enforcement, unfortunately TikTok will be forced to go dark on January 19,\" the company added.",
      "The power of TikTok",
      "With 170 million monthly active users, TikTok is a significant moneymaker for millions of small businesses. For Simon, her company's reach on the platform generated enough sales to allow her to build a 2,100 square foot warehouse and to hire a team of employees to help make the company's products. Mississippi Candle surpassed six figures in sales for the first time in November, and again in December, she told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am heartbroken for my staff,\" she said. \"I won't be able to make up for that traffic or sales anywhere else,\" she said. Simon's company has 50,000 followers on TikTok, compared with 7,700 on Facebook and 3,100 on Instagram.",
      "\"So we won't be able to make up that income. We'll have to completely rebuild our community somewhere else, and it will take a lot longer than it did on TikTok,\" Simon added.",
      "Who wins if TikTok exits the U.S.?",
      "Morgan Stanley analysts say that Facebook and Instagram owner Meta stands to benefit from TikTok users migrating to other platforms, writing that the roughly 32 billion hours of annual U.S. consumer time spent on TikTok could soon be up for grabs.",
      "\"Meta remains the largest fundamental winner of any TikTok ban given its already leading user base, data set and distribution,\" the analysts said in a research note. Alphabet-owned YouTube also could benefit as it also lets users create short-form videos.",
      "Still, experts say that none of those apps come close to TikTok in its ability to generate income for brands, advertisers and creators.",
      "\"A ton of people are already flocking to other apps, but there is going to be a ton of damage and loss of revenue,\" Edward Klaris, managing partner at Klaris law, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"There are going to have to find alternative means of speaking, and this ban reduces their presence on a platform where they are already well-established.\"",
      "The parties that stand to lose from TikTok's U.S. operations shutting down range from independent content creators to businesses and advertisers. In the case of companies, TikTok allows them to establish accounts that reach users organically, as well with paid-ads. And popular influencers can make a lucrative living, with brands paying them to hawk their products.",
      "\"Advertisers are engaging in commercial speech to send out messages, influencers are doing commercial speech and businesses are also sharing information. Therefore there is a lot of spend going on,\" Klaris explained.",
      "He agreed that a ban could be good news for competitors like RedNote, another Chinese-owned app.",
      "The ramifications of shutting down TikTok in the U.S. would be wide-reaching for diverse users, according to Jessica Rauchberg, assistant professor of communication technologies at Seton Hall University.",
      "\"It really concerns me for everyday creators, particularly marginalized ones, who might have a disability and not be able to work in person,\" she said. \"TikTok is a great space for users to supplement their incomes with content creation, and when you lose that, where do you go? You can't just rebuild on another platform.\"",
      "\"It's a great way to reach customers, because a lot of younger people use it as a search engine and place to find a great local restaurant or craftsperson who is making special items you can't find at a Target or Walmart,\" Rauchberg added. \"It'll hurt consumers, and for small businesses it's a big tool for outreach. That's why they are scared.\"",

      "Top technology company CEOs, whose companies have collectively donated millions to Trump's Presidential Inaugural Committee, are expected to have a conspicuous presence at the ceremony. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is\u00a0scheduled to attend, sources told CBS News this week; the online retailer was among the companies that donated $1 million to the fund.",

    "summary": "A law that could ban TikTok in the U.S. is set to take effect on Jan. 19. Here's what that would mean for users of the social media platform.",
    "story": [
      "TikTok faces a\u00a0possible ban in the U.S.\u00a0as soon as Sunday if a law that could require the social media app's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to part ways with the platform takes effect as scheduled on Jan. 19.",
      "The\u00a0Supreme Court on Friday upheld the law, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, that would\u00a0make it illegal\u00a0for app stores from Google or Apple, as well as web-hosting services, to distribute or service TikTok.",
      "The Biden administration and lawmakers\u00a0say TikTok poses a threat\u00a0to U.S. national security, warning that the Chinese government can use the app to collect information and otherwise snoop on American users of the app. For its part, TikTok and some content creators on the platform argued the law violates their First Amendment rights to free speech.",
      "TikTok could evade a ban if ByteDance agreed to sell its American operations to a U.S. entity. Bloomberg reported\u00a0Tuesday that Elon Musk could have interest in such a deal. Still, Wedbush technology analyst Dan Ives said that he doesn't expect ByteDance to sell TikTok with its algorithm, which is widely considered to be the platform's most valuable feature.",
      "Musk did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment.",
      "Asked for comment on the possibility of a sale of its U.S. operations to Musk, a spokesperson for TikTok told CBS MoneyWatch, \"We can't be expected to comment on pure fiction.\"",
      "Could I use TikTok after the ban?",
      "TikTok has said it could go dark in the U.S. on Jan. 19.\u00a0But it remains unclear if President-elect Donald Trump, who had\u00a0urged the Supreme Court\u00a0to pause implementation of the law, will intervene and seek a solution once he takes office.",
      "If the law goes into force on Jan. 19, people in the U.S. who have not already downloaded the TikTok app would no longer be able to access it. It will no longer be available for download in app stores, including Apple's and Google's.",
      "For TikTok users who already have the short-form video app on their devices, it remains to be seen what will happen to the app. In one scenario, it will go dark, and users will receive a notice indicating that it's not functional or available to them.",
      "\"They will get a notice that says, 'This service is not available in your country. That's most likely what will happen based on what we've seen in other countries that have banned certain platforms,\" Timothy Edgar, a professor of cybersecurity at Brown University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This generation may be in for a very rude awakening if the law goes into effect and they find a major social media platform that they came to rely on as creators, or just users, is suddenly not available.\"",
      "While such an action would be unprecedented in the U.S., that's been the experience of users of banned apps in other countries, added Edgar, who thinks this is most likely outcome in the U.S.",
      "Other cybersecurity experts say TikTok might not become inaccessible overnight, but rather that the user experience in the U.S. will degrade over time.",
      "\"If you already have TikTok on your phone you can still use it, but over time you will not receive any updates, so the app will become obsolete,\" said Qi Liao, a professor of computer and network security at Central Michigan University, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Various issues could arise because TikTok may introduce new features or security patches, and the app in the U.S. will have a sluggish performance as well as security issues. So eventually TikTok users will probably stop using the vulnerable version.\"",
      "Could I access TikTok through a VPN?",
      "Edgar notes that the new law doesn't target users, meaning that even if the ban takes effect it wouldn't be illegal for people to have TikTok on their phones or to try to access the platform.",
      "Indeed, U.S.-based users would likely be able to work around the ban by using a virtual private network to access TikTok. VPNs offer privacy and can make U.S.-based computers appear to internet service providers to be based outside of the country.",
      "Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit focused on digital rights, told CBS MoneyWatch that U.S. TikTok users would likely be able to circumvent the ban via VPN, though that approach does carry risks.",
      "\"Presumably, it would work just fine,\" she said, while warning that \"a lot of free VPNs make money by selling user data.\"",
      "Galperin added that some providers of free VPN services have been known to install malware on users' devices. \"So I would advise people to be very careful about the VPN they choose,\" she said.",
      "Meanwhile, Edgar cautioned that more sophisticated VPNs require time, money and effort to set up.",
      "\"It's not something Americans are used to doing because we haven't experienced our government filtering the internet,\" he said.",
      "What are some TikTok alternatives?",
      "Users looking for a TikTok replacement app do have alternatives, such as YouTube Shorts and Instagram Reels.",
      "\"Short-form video content is something people want and they'll continue to find ways to get it,\" Edgar said.",
      "Another substitute is Lemon8, a social media app owned by ByteDance that launched in 2020, although experts note it could be subject to the same law that threatens to ban TikTok in the U.S.",
      "RedNote, a Shanghai-based Chinese language social media app also bears many similarities to TikTok. Called \"Xiaohongshu\" in China, meaning \"little red book\" in Mandarin, it's available for download in app stores in the U.S., and is currently the top social app in Apple's store.",

      "Failure to investigate potential fraud",
      "Peer-to-peer platforms such as Cash App are generally required by law, under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, to investigate disputes of unauthorized transactions. But Cash App customers, many of whom have their bank account linked to the app, were misled by the terms of service to believe that disputes over transactions were the responsibility of their bank, the CFPB said.",
      "In one instance cited in the agency's consent order, Cash App instructed a customer who reported an unauthorized debit card to contact the person's bank, shirking its statutory duty to investigate possible incidents of fraud.",
      "\"In numerous instances, respondent failed to conduct investigations promptly or in some cases at all upon Notices of Error from consumers that provided the required information,\" the CFPB said.",
      "When Block did investigate disputes, it \"used intentionally shoddy investigation practices to close reports of unauthorized transactions in the company's favor,\" the consumer agency added.",
      "Unreachable customer service",
      "Block also made it difficult for Cash App clients to obtain helpful customer service, according to the CFPB. For many years, a telephone number listed on the back of the app's Cash Card and in the terms of service connected users to a pre-recorded redirecting them to contact customer support through the app. Those who contacted Cash App customer service through the app, or in some cases by mail, frequently received \"delayed, inadequate, confusing or inaccurate responses,\" the agency said.",
      "In addition to the $175 million in refunds and fine, the consent order requires Block to provide 24-hour, live-person customer service. It also requires that Block investigate unauthorized transactions promptly and thoroughly as well as \"to provide timely refunds, where appropriate.\"",
      "How do I get my refund?",
      "Block is required to pay a minimum amount of $75 million and up to $120 million in refunds to consumers victimized by fraudulent transactions who did not receive refunds they were entitled to, as well as to those whose unauthorized transfers were not adequately investigated by Cash App. Consumers whose accounts were locked or who were not provided provisional credits during a delayed investigation are also entitled to a refund.",
      "Consumers will not need to take action to obtain a refund, according to the CFPB's latest guidance. The agency said it will enforce the order's requirement to ensure that affected Cash App users receive refunds and other redress.",
      "With more than 56 million accounts, Cash App is one of the largest peer-to-peer payment platforms in the country. The service allows consumers to send and receive electronic money transfers to accept direct deposits and use a prepaid Cash Card to make purchases and ATM withdrawals.",

    "summary": "With the U.S. ban on TikTok looming, many Americans are opting for another Chinese app known as RedNote. It could be short-lived.",
    "story": [
      "With the U.S. government's TikTok ban\u00a0set to kick in on Sunday, Americans have been flocking to an alternative social media platform, but it's another Chinese app, and experts say it could present the same, if not even more issues. There's been a surge in U.S. downloads of the Chinese-owned application Xiaohongshu, or \"RedNote\" as many users call it.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News on Thursday that RedNote, just like TikTok, could face an ultimatum to divest, or be banned.",
      "\"This appears to be the kind of app that the statute would apply to and could face the same restrictions as TikTok if it's not divested,\" a U.S. official told CBS News.",
      "CBS News has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment as to whether the company would agree with that assessment.",
      "What is RedNote?",
      "Xiaohongshu has been the most downloaded free app on Apple's app store in the U.S. since Tuesday. Analysis by Sensor Tower, a market intelligence firm, showed the platform's downloads in the U.S. had increased 200% year-on-year and seen a 194% uptick since last week.",
      "QR Code Generator, a firm that provides statistics on trends online, said there had been a 4,900% increase in searches on Google for Xiaohongshu in the U.S. on Monday alone.",
      "Xiaohongshu was founded in 2013 and is a lifestyle platform \"where over 300 million users every month share their life experiences,\" according to a description on Apple's app store.",
      "The Chinese photo and video-sharing platform has often been compared to Instagram. It operates as a platform for e-commerce, a manual for tips on travel and fine dining, as well as a vehicle for users to share content from their everyday lives.",
      "Xiaohongshu literally translates from Mandarin to \"little red book,\" likely a reference to the famed little red book of quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of Communist China.",
      "That reference has not put off the many American users who've turned to the app to share their experiences as so-called \"TikTok refugees\" ahead of the U.S. ban. Videos including a use of the \"TikTok refugee\" term on RedNote have racked up millions of views and impressions this week.",
      "\"This is for my fellow TikTok refugees and Americans, behave on this app! You better behave because everyone in China is being so kind to us as we colonize their cutesy tootsy app just because our government sucks,\" one American user account using the name \"Savannah\" posted on Wednesday. The post had gained almost 128,000 impressions by Thursday.",
      "TikTok, in its international form, is not available to users in mainland China, meaning the U.S. exodus to Xiaohongshu has put Americans in closer contact with Chinese users than they ever had been before. It's led to some amusing cultural exchanges.",
      "One American \"TikTok refugee\" with the username \"anieladiaz\" posted a video asking Chinese users if they had any questions. A Chinese user commented under the post with a screenshot of what appeared to be their English homework. Anieladiaz was happy to provide the answers to the test questions, which they shared in their own screenshot. Other Chinese users have been posting videos in which they teach Americans to use Mandarin slang words.",
      "Is RedNote safe?",
      "The rapid rise in U.S. downloads may be cause for concern for the same U.S. lawmakers who ushered in the ban on TikTok. One cybersecurity expert told CBS News that RedNote may actually represent an even greater threat.",
      "\"RedNote was never meant for outside of the China market. All of the data sharing and all the servers to which the data is being shared is in China,\" Adrianus Warmenhoven, a cybersecurity expert at Nord VPN, told CBS News on Wednesday. \"It means they are exempt from all of these data protections and outside of the view of the American government.\"",
      "Warmenhoven said TikTok and its parent company ByteDance had at least stored data in U.S.-based servers, which gave the U.S. government \"some modicum of moderation or limitations on data that can be sent to China and how much and in what way.\"",
      "He also said RedNote's terms and conditions lack transparency, which he said presents a huge cybersecurity risk for Americans.",
      "\"Its terms and conditions are in Mandarin, leaving non-Chinese-speaking users unclear about what data is collected and how it's used,\" Warmenhoven said. \"I'm pretty sure those millions who are moving over are not using Google Translate to read [the terms and conditions] so they don't know what they are agreeing to.\"",
      "The specific U.S. legislation\u00a0used to ban TikTok \u2014 the \"Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act,\" which President Biden signed into law last April, grants the federal government broad scope to crack down on foreign social media platforms.",
      "Under the law, Congress can compel a platform to divest its U.S. operations from foreign ownership, and it can be shut down if it qualifies as a threat. The law can apply to any platform that allows users to share content with each other and has more than 1 million monthly active users, is owned by a company located in a foreign adversary-controlled country, and has been determined by the president to present a significant national security threat.",
      "The legislation is currently subject to a legal challenge by ByteDance, which has argued that it's unconstitutional and violates the first amendment protecting free speech. A ruling from the Supreme Court is pending\u00a0in that case.",
      "CBS News has asked President-elect Donald Trump's transition team whether the incoming administration might deem RedNote a national security threat that should be subject to the law. The transition team had not responded by the time of the publication of this article.",
      "Trump has spoken out recently against the TikTok ban. Last month, he said he had a \"warm spot in my heart\" for TikTok \u2013 a reversal from his stance when he last occupied the Oval Office.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the ban and ensuring that internet service providers in the U.S. and app store companies such as Apple and Google comply with the law, declined to comment.",
      "RedNote is heavily censored",
      "Content on RedNote appears to be much more heavily censored than posts on TikTok. A CBS News analysis found that any search for \"Xi Jinping,\" China's autocratic president, on RedNote yielded no results whatsoever.",
      "The term \"Free Hong Kong\" also brought back no results. A search for \"Taiwan\" will turn up several memes welcoming Americans to the platform, but noting that users must recognize the Beijing-imposed narrative that the democratically governed island just off China's coast, which the U.S. is legally bound to help defend from invasion, is an inseparable part of China.",
      "A similar search for those terms on TikTok turns up a wide range of political opinions from users, including posts heavily critical of Chinese censorship.",
      "RedNote even appears to be scaling up operations to monitor content given the vast number of Americans signing onto the app. CBS News found local job listings posted by the company online in mainland China advertising jobs to review English content and promising a monthly salary of between $950 and $1,200.",
      "\"Users are not going to a place with more freedom. RedNote is moderated differently, and the algorithm is different from TikTok,\" Warmenhoven told CBS News. \"You will not get traction or it will not spread politically sensitive issues, or maybe social sensitive issues \u2014 especially issues that are socially sensitive in China.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The former sister-in-law of Pete Hegseth, President Trump's nominee to become secretary of defense, told senators in a sworn affidavit that he caused his second wife to fear for her personal safety and abused alcohol over the course of many years.",
      "In the affidavit to members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that was obtained by CBS News, Danielle Hegseth said she was married to Pete Hegseth's brother from 2011 to 2019. She recounted what she had told FBI agents who conducted a background check into Hegseth as part of the nomination process. She wrote that her statement came in response to a letter from Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee.",
      "NBC News first reported on the document. Tim Parlatore, an attorney for Hegseth, denied the allegations, calling Danielle Hegseth an \"anti-Trump far left Democrat.\"",
      "In the affidavit, she wrote that Samantha Hegseth, Pete Hegseth's second and now ex-wife, had told her that she once hid in the closet from Hegseth for fear of her safety, an incident she said occurred between the years of 2014 and 2016. She noted the anecdote was consistent with what she observed of Hegseth's behavior over a number of years.",
      "Hegseth's former sister-in-law also alleged that his ex-wife had a plan that she would use if she needed to get away from her husband. The plan involved Samantha Hegseth texting a safe word to Danielle Hegseth, who would then call a friend who could help her. Danielle Hegseth wrote that she received a text with the safe word and called the friend once between 2015 and 2016. Pete and Samantha Hegseth were married from 2010 to 2018.",
      "Danielle Hegseth acknowledged that she did not personally witness abuse and noted that what she knows of the situation she heard from Hegseth's ex-wife.",
      "At his\u00a0confirmation hearing\u00a0last week, Hegseth was asked by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine: \"Did you ever engage in any acts of physical violence against any of your wives?\" He replied: \"Senator, absolutely not.\"",
      "Danielle Hegseth also claimed that he had drunkenly yelled at her and had to be pulled away during a 2009 incident, and that she personally witnessed Hegseth abusing alcohol on multiple occasions. She said Hegseth would drink to the point of passing out at family events, described one evening where she said he was dragged out of a bar, and another where she said he passed out in a bar bathroom, among other incidents.",
      "The affidavit was signed Tuesday in Hennepin County, Minnesota. Hegseth's former sister-in-law noted in the affidavit that her statement repeats what she told the FBI.",
      "Danielle Hegseth said she was providing the response because she does not think her former brother-in-law is fit to serve as defense secretary. She encouraged the Senate to consider the affidavit in its vote on Hegseth's nomination, which advanced out of committee on Monday.",
      "Parlatore, Hegseth's attorney, denied the allegations in a statement, saying that Hegseth's ex-wife \"has never alleged that there was any abuse.\" He said Samantha Hegseth signed court documents to that effect and reaffirmed that there was no abuse during her FBI interview.",
      "\"Belated claims by Danielle Dietrich, an anti-Trump far left Democrat who is divorced from Mr. Hegseth's brother and never got along with the Hegseth family, do nothing to change that,\" Parlatore said. \"After an acrimonious divorce, Ms. Dietrich has had an axe to grind against the entire Hegseth family. Ms. Dietrich admits that she saw nothing but is now falsely accusing Sam of lying to both the Court and to the FBI because of private, undocumented statements that she allegedly made 10 years ago.\"",
      "Samantha Hegseth could not immediately be reached for comment, but told NBC News in an email that \"I do not believe your information to be accurate\" and declined to speak about her marriage to Hegseth.",
      "Hegseth appeared before the Armed Services Committee for his\u00a0confirmation hearing on Jan. 14, where he fielded tough questions from Democrats over his views on women in the military and an allegation of sexual assault, which he also denied.",
      "Hegseth faced intense scrutiny over reports about his background, and for weeks was considered to have the steepest path to confirmation out of\u00a0 Mr. Trump's Cabinet nominees. But Republican senators on the Armed Services Committee defended his nomination during the hearing, after which one key member, Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa, made her support for Hegseth's confirmation known.",

    "story": [
      "A coalition of Democratic state attorneys general filed a federal lawsuit on Tuesday to stop President Trump's executive order that seeks to eliminate birthright citizenship.",
      "Mr. Trump invoked presidential powers to begin his long-promised immigration crackdown shortly after taking office on Monday. His executive actions included an order directing the federal government to stop issuing passports, citizenship certificates and other documents to many children born in the U.S. whose mothers are in the country illegally, or for whom neither parent is a legal permanent resident.",
      "The lawsuit by the 18 states, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, claims Mr. Trump's initiative violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which the federal government has long interpreted to mean that those born on American soil are citizens at birth. The cities of San Francisco and Washington, D.C., also joined the suit. The 14th Amendment says: \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\"",
      "\"The great promise of our nation is that everyone born here is a citizen of the United States, able to achieve the American dream,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement to CBS News. \"This fundamental right to birthright citizenship, rooted in the 14th Amendment and born from the ashes of slavery, is a cornerstone of our nation's commitment to justice.\"",
      "The suit is seeking a preliminary injunction to halt enforcement of the executive order, and ultimately, to invalidate it. The states that joined the suit are: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.",
      "\"The President's executive order attempting to rescind birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional and quite frankly, un-American,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"We are asking a court to immediately block this order from taking effect and ensure that the rights of American-born children impacted by this order remain in effect while litigation proceeds. The President has overstepped his authority by a mile with this order, and we will hold him accountable.\"",
      "Mr. Trump directed that his order should be enforced in 30 days. It was challenged soon after it was issued, when the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups filed a separate lawsuit seeking to thwart it.",
      "Later Tuesday, a group of four more states \u2014 Illinois, Arizona, Washington and Oregon \u2014 filed a separate lawsuit of their own in Washington state targeting the executive order.",
      "\"We need to discuss bipartisan commonsense immigration reforms, but denying birthright citizenship, which dates back centuries and has been upheld twice by the U.S. Supreme Court, is not the solution,\" Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Tuesday dramatically broadened the scope of expedited deportations, enacting a nationwide expansion of an immigration policy known as \"expedited removal\" that was previously limited to areas close to U.S. borders.",
      "Expedited removal allows U.S. immigration officials to deport migrants who lack proper documents through a streamlined process that bypasses the lengthy and massively backlogged immigration court system. If those identified for expedited removal do not request asylum or fail to establish they may have a legitimate asylum case, they can be expeditiously deported, without an opportunity to see an immigration judge.",
      "Before Tuesday's change, federal immigration officials were only allowed to use expedited removal on unauthorized immigrants detained within 100 miles of an international border and who had been in the U.S. for less than two weeks.",
      "Now, these expedited deportations will apply to unauthorized immigrants anywhere in the U.S. who can't prove they have been in the country for more than two years. The move by the Department of Homeland Security revived a first Trump administration policy that the Biden administration had discontinued. It took effect at 6 p.m. Eastern Time on Tuesday.",
      "In less than 48 hours since returning to the Oval Office, President Trump has already taken a flurry of actions, some of them unprecedented in nature, to launch a multi-faced crackdown on immigration.",
      "Mr. Trump shut down access to the U.S. asylum system using extraordinary presidential powers; declared a national emergency to dispatch more troops to the southern border; froze the refugee admissions programs; and directed federal agencies to deny birthright citizenship to the children of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally or on temporary visas. The latter action has already triggered lawsuits from Democratic-led states and pro-immigrant groups.",
      "The president has also laid the foundations for his promised mass deportations, directing federal officials to expand immigration detention facilities and allow local law enforcement authorities to arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants. His administration rescinded Biden-era guidelines that barred deportation officers from making arrests at so-called \"sensitive locations,\" which include schools and churches.",

      "The order is at odds with the statements of transgender Americans, who say they are trying to use spaces that align with their gender identity, not \"gain access to intimate single-sex spaces and activities designed for women.\"",
      "The president's executive order means the secretaries of the State Department, Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Personnel Management will require that government-issued identification documents, including visas, passports, and Global Entry cards, \"accurately reflect the holder's sex.\" Americans have been able to select \"X\" on their passports\u00a0since April 2022\u00a0under former President Joe Biden.",
      "The gender executive order also says the federal government is not to use terms like gender identity, instead using the sex assigned at birth.",
      "\"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology,\" the order reads. \"Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\"",

      "Legally speaking, Thomas Berry, director at the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, said the executive order is wide-ranging, but aspects of it may run up against a 2020 Supreme Court decision. In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia, the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 vote that it is\u00a0illegal for an employer to fire someone because they are gay or transgender.",
      "\"It's such wide-ranging executive order,\" Berry said of Mr. Trump's action. \"I think some he has the authority to do and some parts of it are going to be more controversial. So one thing that strikes me immediately that I'm curious about is to what extent is he going to try to push back against the Supreme Court's Bostock decision from within the last five years, where the Supreme Court explicitly held that the 1964 Civil Rights Act applies to both sexual orientation as well as gender identity, and discrimination on the basis of gender identity. So that's \u2014 that's a statute, the interpretation of which is up to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court has made a binding decision.\"",
      "Berry said the federal government will likely have more latitude in how it applies the order internally within the federal government, such as how federal employees may identify.",
      "Supporters of LGBTQ   rights have vowed to fight the Trump administration's changes however they can.",
      "Chase Strangio, co-director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT and HIV Project, said the ACLU is closely studying the impact and implementation of the order. Strangio said Tuesday that it's not yet clear whether changes will be retroactive with, for instance, State-Department-issued passports.",
      "\"I would anticipate a lot of future legal actions, but all of that will depend on what we actually see from the various agencies charged with implementing the various pieces of this executive order,\" Strangio said.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior legal counsel with Lambda Legal that focuses on LGBT civil rights issues, also mentioned the Supreme Court's decision in Bostock as potentially counter to this order.",

      "Mr. Trump first announced DOGE in November with a statement that said the effort would \"provide advice and guidance from outside of Government.\" The goal, he added in November, would be to provide recommendations to \"slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies.\"",
      "Musk and Ramaswamy wrote in a November Wall Street Journal opinion article that they aimed to cut $500 billion in annual federal costs by targeting \"expenditures that are unauthorized by Congress or being used in ways that Congress never intended.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump's executive order says that DOGE will in fact be housed within the executive branch, rather than operating as an outside advisory committee. The EO also states that an existing White House office called the U.S. Digital Service \u2014 a unit that primarily works on improving government websites and tech \u2014 will be renamed the U.S. DOGE Service.",
      "DOGE's purpose will be to \"implement the President's DOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,\" the EO states.",
      "The executive order doesn't include any details about cutting federal spending, slashing regulations or restructuring federal agencies. To be sure, the lack of a mention in the EO about cost-cutting doesn't mean that DOGE won't also tackle those issues, as well as taking on a mandate to upgrade federal IT systems.",
      "The Trump administration didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "DOGE lawsuits",
      "The EO comes as DOGE faces multiple lawsuits\u00a0over its structure and efforts so far, with the cases filed shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration on Monday. The lawsuits claim that because DOGE was operating as a federal advisory committee, it was in violation of a law called the Federal Advisory Committee Act, or FACA.",
      "FACA regulates the functions and transparency of federal advisory committees, requiring them to operate transparently and publicly, as well as include representation from people who could be affected by their operations.",
      "But with Mr. Trump's EO establishing DOGE as a unit within the executive branch, it appears that the effort will not be operating as a federal advisory committee. Democracy Forward, which is representing some of the groups suing DOGE, said the executive order doesn't alter their plans.",
      "\"Our legal team is reviewing yesterday's executive orders. DOGE has been operating secretly and out of compliance with federal law for some time, which yesterday's executive orders could not impact,\" Skye Perryman, CEO of Democracy Forward, said in a statement.",
      "And National Security Counselors, another public service group that is suing DOGE, said that it doesn't \"have any reason to believe that the entity created by the recent executive order is the same animal as the advisory committee we are litigating about.\"",
      "\"The executive order has definitely muddied the waters a bit, but at the end of the day, the deciding factor will be what the new U.S. DOGE Service actually does and how,\" said Kel McClanahan, executive director of National Security Counselors, said on Tuesday. \"It is difficult to imagine the sprawling DOGE written about by Musk and Ramaswamy slamming on its brakes and taking a job modernizing agency IT systems.\"",
      "Ramaswamy leaving DOGE",
      "Meanwhile, DOGE is losing one of its co-leaders, with Ramaswamy posting on social media on Jan. 20 that he is stepping back from the effort. Ramaswamy intends to announce a campaign for Ohio governor as soon as the end of January, CBS News has reported.",
      "\"It was my honor to help support the creation of DOGE. I'm confident that Elon & team will succeed in streamlining government,\" Ramaswamy wrote.",
      "According to Mr. Trump's EO, DOGE will be a \"temporary organization\" that will focus on \"advancing the President's 18-month DOGE agenda.\" The EO says that DOGE will come to an end on July 4, 2026.",
      "On Monday, Trump said DOGE will have about \"about 20 people\" working in its office.",
      "According to the U.S. Digital Service, the unit currently has about 230 employees, with recent work by the unit including assisting the IRS on its new Direct File service, as well as improving the Social Security Administration's website. DOGE says its SSA work is\u00a0projected to save the agency about $285 million over five years in infrastructure expenses.",

      "Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan was ousted by the Trump administration Tuesday, on President Trump's first full day in office. In 2022, Fagan became the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. military.",
      "Fagan was relieved of her duties Monday night in a workforce-wide message by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Benjamin Huffman.",
      "\"Under my statutory authority as the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security I have relieved Admiral Linda L. Fagan of her duties as Commandant of the United States Coast Guard,\" the brief message read, in part. \"She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation.\"",
      "The Coast Guard commandant is appointed for a four-year term, and Fagan had served two years.",
      "A senior DHS official said in a statement that Fagan was terminated \"because of her leadership deficiencies, operational failures, and inability to advance the strategic objectives of the U.S. Coast Guard.\"",
      "In particular, the official said she had failed to address border security threats, citing \"insufficient coordination\" with DHS on operations along maritime borders and \"ineffective deployment of Coast Guard assets\" to support efforts to interdict fentanyl and other illicit substances.",
      "The official also cited \"significant shortfalls\" in recruitment and mismanagement, including \"[i]nadequate accountability for acquisition failures highlighted during the Trump 45 Administration.\"",
      "During her time as head of the service, Fagan worked to bolster the recruitment and retention of personnel amid a slump in numbers across the U.S. armed forces. Last year,\u00a0as CBS News reported, the U.S. Coast Guard met its recruitment goals for its active-duty workforce, the reserves and officers for the first time since 2007.",
      "And Hagan was also criticized by the official for \"[e]xcessive focus on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies including at the US Coast Guard Academy, diverting resources and attention from operational imperatives.\"",
      "Fagan worked to rebuild trust within the halls of Congress and the agency's own ranks, following previous revelations that the\u00a0Coast Guard had mishandled sexual harassment and assault allegations. But the official said there had been a \"failure to adequately address the systemic issues\" and blamed Fagan for \"a leadership culture unwilling to ensure accountability and transparency in protecting service members.\"",
      "Adm. Kevin Lunday, the service's No. 2 in command, was named acting Coast Guard commandant, according to Huffman's note. Lunday became vice commandant last June.",
      "The Coast Guard, which sits under the Department of Homeland Security, has faced a budget crunch for several administrations. Several recent commandants, including Fagan, had urged lawmakers to fund the construction of new ships and repair of older ones to assist in the service's expanding global role in safeguarding national security. Last year, the Coast Guard officially welcomed its first polar icebreaker in more than 25 years.",
      "Trump adviser Elon Musk, who leads the new administration's effort to cut costs across the federal government, did not explicitly confirm the termination of Fagan but\u00a0wrote on X in response to the news\u00a0that \"undermining the U.S. military and border security to spend money on racist/sexist DEI nonsense is no longer acceptable.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Just hours after President Trump's inauguration, his administration revoked a Biden-era policy that prohibited arrests by U.S. immigration agents at or near schools, places of worship and other places deemed to be \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "Benjamine Huffman, whom the Trump administration installed as acting homeland security secretary pending the confirmation of South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, issued a memo on Monday reversing the Biden administration's immigration arrest guidelines on \"sensitive locations.\"",
      "That policy, signed by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, instructed Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection to refrain from apprehending unauthorized immigrants at or near locations \"that would restrain people's access to essential services or engagement in essential activities.\" Those locations included schools; places of worship; hospitals and other healthcare facilities; shelters; relief centers; and public demonstrations, like rallies and protests.",
      "In a statement defending the termination of the Biden administration rule, the Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration \"will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense.\"",
      "Pro-immigrant advocates had feared the rescission of the Biden-era rules, warning that it would allow the Trump administration to bring its mass deportations plans to churches and schools.",
      "But the Trump administration said Monday's decision was designed to target unauthorized immigrants with serious criminal histories.",
      "\"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens \u2014 including murders and rapists \u2014 who have illegally come into our country,\" DHS said in its statement. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest.\"",
      "Monday's action is part of a larger effort by the Trump administration to eliminate limits other administrations have placed on ICE operations as it lays the groundwork for what the president has pledged will be the largest deportation operation in American history. The administration is expected to ramp up immigration arrests in cities and communities with \"sanctuary\" policies that restrict cooperation between local enforcement and ICE.",
      "The administration is also expected to rescind other Biden administration memos that discontinued mass immigration sweeps at worksites like factories and that limited ICE arrests to serious criminals, national security threats and recent border arrivals.",
      "Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" has repeatedly said the new administration, like every administration, will prioritize the arrest of immigrants who are in the country illegally and who have committed crimes. But he has stressed that no one will be exempt from immigration enforcement if they are in the U.S. illegally, warning that arrests of non-criminal unauthorized immigrants are likely.",
      "Mr. Trump moved swiftly on his first day back in the White House to launch his long-expected immigration crackdown, issuing a blitz of orders that sought to deny birthright citizenship to the children of unauthorized immigrants and temporary visas holders; suspend asylum and refugee admissions; and enlist the military's aid in border enforcement though an emergency declaration.",
      "Another executive order directed officials to expand detention sites to hold deportees and increase agreements with local law enforcement authorities, so they can arrest and detain unauthorized immigrants as deputized immigration officers.",

      "Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik\u00a0focused on an \"America First\" message at her confirmation hearing Tuesday, and pledged to implement President Trump's agenda while rolling out a review of U.S. funding for some of the world body's agencies.",
      "Stefanik, one of President Trump's most reliable allies in Congress, appeared before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for her confirmation hearing less than 24 hours after Mr. Trump was sworn into office. Mr. Trump hopes his key Cabinet picks will sail through confirmation, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio was confirmed in a unanimous vote on Monday, and was sworn in on Tuesday. Stefanik is likely to be confirmed when the full Senate takes up a vote.",
      "Noting that the U.S. is the largest single contributor to the United Nations, she pointed to the children's agency UNICEF and the World Food Program as examples of U.N. entities that are \"effective,\" but said the U.S. has to ensure its investments are making America safer, stronger and more prosperous \u2014 echoing Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "\"Our tax dollars should not be complicit in propping up entities that are counter to American interests, antisemitic, or engaging in fraud, corruption or terrorism,\" Stefanik said in her opening remarks before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "She stressed the need to reform the world body, where lawmakers raised the ability of American adversaries Russia and China to veto resolutions in the U.N. Security Council, and went so far as to say that it has not lived up to its founding mission.",
      "Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican committee chair, set the tone by sharply criticizing the U.N. at the start of the hearing, saying that Stefanik \"can bring much-needed change\" to the institution.",
      "\"At this point, the U.S. should seriously examine if further contributions and, indeed, participation in the U.N. is even beneficial to the American people,\" the Idaho lawmaker said.",
      "Harvard-educated and the fourth-ranking member of the U.S. House, Stefanik was elected to Congress in 2015 as a moderate Republican and is leaving a decade later as one of Trump's most ardent allies. She embraced Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as he denied he lost the election to Democrat Joe Biden.",
      "When Trump announced Stefanik's appointment, his former national security adviser John Bolton told The Associated Press that he sees her as the new version of Trump's U.N. ambassador in his first administration \u2014 Nikki Haley. Haley went on to challenge him, unsuccessfully, for the GOP nomination last year.",
      "Stefanik \"wants to run for president in 2028,\" said Bolton, who also served as U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in President George W. Bush's administration. \"She realizes she has no foreign policy experience, so what better way than to become U.N. ambassador. She stays two years, and then away we go.\"",
      "Stefanik was asked about her views on the wars in Gaza, Ukraine, Sudan and elsewhere as well as the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs \u2014 all issues on the U.N. agenda.",
      "The United States pays about one-fifth of the U.N.'s regular budget, and she has already been questioned about her comments on cutting the U.N. budget and continuing support for its multiple agencies. Those tackle everything from health, education and migration to reproductive rights and nuclear proliferation.",
      "She responded by saying she is open to reviewing agencies to ensure \"that all of our taxpayer dollars are going to entities that function very well.\"",
      "But she also agreed with Democratic Sen. Chris Coons about supporting efforts to strengthen alliances, especially when it comes to China's influence at the world body. Trump has been skeptical of U.S. alliances, including NATO and defense partnerships in the Asia-Pacific, which the Biden team worked to shore up after taking over from Trump after his first term.",
      "Stefanik saw her profile rise after her aggressive questioning last year of a trio of university presidents about antisemitism on their campuses, leading to two of their resignations \u2014 a performance Trump repeatedly praised.",
      "\"I was interested in this position because if you look at the antisemitic rot within the United Nations, there are more resolutions targeting Israel than any other country, any other crisis combined,\" Stefanik testified.",
      "Who is Elise Stefanik?",
      "Stefanik, 40, would be the youngest-ever U.S. ambassador to the U.N. The New York Republican has served in a leadership position as Republican conference chair, and she was on the House Armed Services Committee and House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. And that skillset honed in Congress will serve her well, said Jon Alterman, senior vice president and director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Alterman said Stefanik brings some of the most important qualities a U.N. ambassador can have \u2014 a close relationship with the president and an ability to communicate and execute his policies.",
      "Elected to represent New York's 21st Congressional District in 2014, Stefanik was the youngest Republican woman to join Congress at the age of 30. She has easily won reelection in her upstate New York district ever since. As GOP conference chair, Stefanik has been the highest-ranking woman in the House.",
      "Born and raised in upstate New York, Stefanik was the first in her immediate family to earn a college degree, according to her office. She graduated from Harvard University, where she studied government.",
      "She has been very vocal about supporting Israel, especially since the Hamas cross-border attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which militants killed about 1,200 people and took some 250 hostage. It led to the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where a ceasefire that the U.S. helped broker has taken hold.",
      "In her 20s, she worked in the White House on President George W. Bush's Domestic Policy Council. Stefanik and her husband have one son.",
      "\"The most important part of being a representative is having a relationship to the president, being able to speak for the president, and speak for the administration's policies,\" Alterman said. \"I think she is very good at thinking about messaging, she understands the president's instincts and he likes her.\"",
      "\"And I think the political skill that you pick up being in Congress ends up being really helpful when you're working in the U.N.,\" Alterman continued. \"I mean, a lot of it is about building coalitions, about neutralizing opposition, about finding compromises. All those kinds of things are skills that Congress and other kinds of political experience is great for.\"",
      "Alterman said he thinks people \"underestimate her communication skills.\"",
      "\"I think she's very smart and savvy,\" Alterman said. \"And having an ambassador to the UN who can understand the impact of her words and actions advances the administration's agenda.\""

    "story": [
      "President Trump is keeping his powder dry, at least for now, in deploying tariffs to advance his administration's push to redefine trade relations with other major economies around the world.",
      "Mr. Trump, who as president-elect said he could move to apply\u00a0sweeping levies\u00a0on foreign imports on his first day in office, stopped short of imposing so-called universal tariffs or directly targeting China, which he had threatened to hit with 60% duties.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said Monday that his administration is considering 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 unless they take stronger measures to stop the flow of unauthorized migrants and and illicit drugs flowing into the U.S.",
      "\"We're thinking in terms of 25% on Mexico and Canada, because they're allowing vast numbers of people \u2014 Canada's a very bad abuser also \u2014 vast numbers of people to come in, and fentanyl to come in,\" Mr. Trump said Monday as he signed a range of executive orders on his first day in office addressing the American economy, immigration, energy policy and other areas.",
      "When asked about his plans for blanket tariffs on U.S. imports, Mr. Trump said they remain a possibility, but \"we're not ready for that yet.\" As a candidate during the 2024 presidential campaign, he proposed across-the-board tariffs of 10% to 20% on all U.S. imports.",
      "In his inaugural address Monday, Mr. Trump said that \"instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens,\" although he didn't offer any specifics.",
      "In a\u00a0memorandum\u00a0on Monday, Mr. Trump also called for a review of existing U.S. trade agreements and asked for recommendations on how the U.S. can gain leverage with trading partners.",
      "Said Mr. Trump in the memo: \"I am establishing a robust and reinvigorated trade policy that promotes investment and productivity, enhances our nation's industrial and technological advantages, defends our economic and national security, and \u2014 above all \u2014 benefits American workers, manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, entrepreneurs and businesses.\"",
      "Winding road on trade",
      "Initially, analysts now expect the Trump administration to implement tariffs incrementally. Economists have warned that steep tariffs could boost inflation and slow economic growth. Mr. Trump has long argued that tariffs deployed during his first term didn't boost inflation and that raising costs on foreign imports can help protect U.S. jobs.",
      "\"In short, the road to tariff implementation might be less straightforward than a universal tariff baseline might imply, given the potential for moving targets around scope and scale,\" Morgan Stanley analysts said Monday in a report.",
      "But other experts said they still expect the Trump administration to eventually adopt a universal tariff, noting that the new regime is examining whether to create what it calls an External Revenue Service to collect tariff revenue. That suggest the \"administration intends for some tariffs to be permanent,\" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist with Capital Economics, told investors in a research note.",
      "Retaliation risk",
      "Meanwhile, any actions by the U.S. to subject other countries to new tariffs would likely spur retaliation, experts say. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised a sharp response to any new levies, saying in a news conference in Ottawa on Tuesday that \"everything\" was now on the table,\" according to AFP.",
      "In November, Canadian government official said it was exploring potential retaliatory tariffs on certain U.S. imports after Mr. Trump, then the president-elect, threatened a 25% tariff on all goods from Canada and Mexico.",
      "A 25% U.S. tariff on Canadian imports would likely drive up inflation in Canada and push it into a recession in 2025, according to econmist Michael Davenport Oxford Economics. The country's auto, energy and heavy manufacturing industries, which rely on exports to the U.S., would feel the greatest impact since those sectors also depend on components from American suppliers, he noted.",
      "The U.S. would also feel the impact of a trade war with Canada, according to experts. Universal tariffs on American products would likely cause a \"shallow\" recession in the U.S., according to Oxford.",
      "Canada also supplies roughly 20% of the oil used stateside. As a result, U.S. gas prices could shoot up 30 to 40 cents a gallon, and potentially up to 70 cents, soon after Trump levied tariffs on Canada, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, has told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Stephanie Brinley, associate director, AutoIntelligence, at S&P Mobility, expects the Trump administration to eventually put a 10% tariff on all imports from Europe, Japan and other countries besides Canada, China or Mexico. The research firm also forecasts a 30% duty on goods from mainland China.",
      "\"We see these tariffs starting from the second quarter and ramping up over the subsequent four quarters,\" she said Tuesday in a report, noting that countries faced with the new U.S. levies are likely to fire back with their own trade sanctions.",

      "More than a decade later, on April 28, 1978, Downing was reported as killed in action. He was later posthumously promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel, the DPAA said. His name was recorded on the National Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. and the American Battle Monuments Commission's Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu, along with the names of other unaccounted-for soldiers from the Vietnam War.",
      "The incident was investigated for decades, to little result, the DPAA said. Finally, in the spring of 2024, a recovery team found life support equipment, possible material evidence, aircraft wreckage, unexploded ordnance and possible osseous materials \u2014 bones \u2014 at a site in Quang Binh Province, Vietnam.",
      "The DPAA uses the intersection of \"history, diplomacy and science\" to make identifications, Ashley Wright, a public affairs specialist with the agency, told CBS News in 2024. Researchers and experts search archival records to learn about the circumstances where a fallen soldier was last seen, and investigative teams talk to surviving witnesses and examine the area for clues. Recovery teams, like the ones that found the evidence at Downings' crash site in 2024, are then sent to the area, Wright said.",
      "Then, once everything is back at the lab, multiple scientists combine their expertise to help make identifications. Forensic odontologists, a kind of dentist, can match evidence to dental records. Tests that reveal a deceased person's diet are used to determine what country a soldier was from \u2014 Americans are more likely to eat a corn-based diet, Wright said. Family members are asked for reference samples of DNA, which can help show a genetic match.",
      "The evidence from Downings' crash was brought to the DPAA laboratory in June 2024. The DPAA said its scientists used anthropological analysis, multiple forms of DNA analysis and material and circumstantial evidence to identify the remains as Downings'.",
      "His family received a full briefing on his identification, the DPAA said, though it did not specify which members that included. Downing was survived by his wife and four children, as well as his parents and four siblings, according to a news clipping published after his disappearance. The news clipping said that Downing had been reported missing in action just a few days before the couple's seventh wedding anniversary.",
      "A rosette will be placed next to his name on the Courts of the Missing to indicate that he has been accounted for. He will be honored with a funeral at Arlington National Cemetery.",

    "story": [
      "In its first 24 hours in office, the Trump administration removed U.S. Secret Service protection from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who became a critic of the president after Bolton's ouster from the first Trump administration in 2019. Multiple sources told CBS News the decision was made in the past 24 hours.",
      "Bolton, an outspoken critic of President Trump, was granted Secret Service protection by the Biden administration in December 2021 for the first time since he served in the Trump White House. That decision followed a series of threats from Iran linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure, resulting in the assassination Iranian General Qasem Soleimani.",
      "In a statement, Bolton told CBS News that he is \"disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has made this decision.\"",
      "\"Notwithstanding my criticisms of President Biden's national-security policies, he nonetheless made the decision to once again extend Secret Service protection to me in 2021,\" Bolton continued.",
      "In 2022, Shahram Porsafi, a member of the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, was charged with a murder plot targeting Bolton. The Justice Department said in 2022 that the plot was \"likely in retaliation for the January 2020 death of Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander Qasem Soleimani.\" The FBI offered a $300,000 reward for information leading to Porsafi's capture. Last September, the Biden administration announced a reward of up to $20 million for information on Porsafi.",
      "In his statement today, Bolton added, \"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination. The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"",
      "Bolton and another former national security adviser under Mr. Trump, Robert O'Brien, required ongoing U.S. Secret Service protection long after they left their positions, both due to potential threats from Iran. For nearly one year of protection, the total for both individuals was $12,280,324, a bill paid by U.S. taxpayers, according to reports filed to Congress by former Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and obtained by CBS' \"60 Minutes\" last year through a Freedom of Information Act request.",
      "As is standard for all Secret Service protectees, Bolton had dedicated special agents keeping him safe\u00a0 24 hours a day, covering his home, as well as both domestic and foreign travel.",
      "The Secret Service declined a request for comment.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump took executive action to start revoking the security clearances of Bolton and dozens of intelligence officials who signed a letter in 2020 claiming emails found on a laptop owned by Hunter Biden bore the hallmarks of a Russian disinformation campaign.",
      "The executive action was part of a slew of measures signed by Mr. Trump in the hours after he was sworn into a second term in office and is one of his first steps he has taken to target those he considers political opponents, now that he has returned to the White House.",
      "Among other first-day actions in the Trump administration, a newly hung portrait of former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley was removed from a wall at the Pentagon. Milley had reportedly previously criticized Mr. Trump as \"fascist\" and a \"wannabe dictator.\"",

      "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered lower courts to review the case of the only woman on Oklahoma's death row over concerns that prosecutors' discussion of her sexual history rendered her trial unfair in the murder of her estranged husband.",
      "The court, over two dissenting votes, threw out a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the sentence and conviction of Brenda Andrew for her role in the killing of advertising executive Rob Andrew in 2001.",
      "James Pavatt, Andrew's lover, also is on death row after he was convicted of killing Andrew with a shotgun in the family garage in Oklahoma City.",
      "In an unsigned opinion, the justices ordered the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to re-examine Andrew's prosecution to determine if judges \"reviewing this record could disagree with Andrew that the trial court's mistaken admission of irrelevant evidence was so 'unduly prejudicial' as to render her trial 'fundamentally unfair.'\"",
      "Justice\u00a0Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice\u00a0Neil Gorsuch, wrote that the state produced overwhelming evidence that Andrew participated in her husband's murder and would have left the conviction and death sentencing in place. Thomas said that the discussion of Andrews' sexual history and mothering was relevant because she described herself as a \"good mother\" as part of her defense.",
      "\"In presenting evidence to the contrary, the State was simply rebutting a point that Andrew had placed in issue, as it clearly is entitled to do,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "Lawyers for Andrew argued that the state had a circumstantial case that it buttressed by presenting evidence about \"her sexual history, gender presentation, demeanor, and motherhood.\"",
      "At trial, the lawyers wrote, \"the prosecution relentlessly derided Ms. Andrew, using sexually-charged descriptions to cast her in the role of an unchaste wife,\" including a prosecutor's reference to her as a \"slut puppy\" and, during closing arguments, the display of her thong underwear.",
      "A three-judge appellate panel affirmed a state appellate ruling that sustained the conviction and death sentence. A dissenting judge on the 10th Circuit wrote that the evidence rendered the trial unfair. Judge Robert Bacharach wrote that the court focused \"from start to finish on Ms. Andrew's sex life,\" which he said had taken away \"any realistic chance that the jury would seriously consider her version of events.\"",
      "\"The evidence not only lacked relevance but also cast Ms. Andrew as a woman fixated on seducing nearby men,\" Bacharach wrote.",

      "\"This fabrication of the imprimatur of the Intelligence Community to suppress information essential to the American people during a presidential election is an egregious breach of trust reminiscent of a third world country,\" the order states. \"And now the faith of Americans in all other patriotic intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect the nation has been imperiled.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly and falsely claimed the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to former President Joe Biden, was stolen. He continued to push his accusations about the last election as recently as Monday, when he told supporters after his inauguration that the 2020 contest was \"totally rigged.\"",
      "The letter at issue was signed by 51 former intelligence officials and released in October 2020 after the New York Post reported on emails recovered from a laptop computer discovered at a Delaware repair shop.

      "\"[T]he arrival on the US political scene of emails purportedly belonging to Vice President Biden's son Hunter, much of it related to his time serving on the Board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,\" the officials wrote in their letter.",

    "summary": "The first volume of special counsel Jack Smith's report on the 2020 election case against President Trump was released last week.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in South Florida blocked the Justice Department from giving lawmakers the portion of former special counsel Jack Smith's report that deals with his investigation into President Trump's handling of classified documents.",
      "In a scathing rebuke of the Justice Department's proposal, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in a 14-page order\u00a0she is granting a request from Mr. Trump's co-defendants to keep the report from the heads of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees. Walt Nauta, an aide to Mr. Trump, and Carlos de Oliveira, the former property manager at Mar-a-Lago, asked Cannon to block its release earlier this month.",
      "\"Never before has the Department of Justice, prior to the conclusion of criminal proceedings against a defendant \u2014 and absent a litigation-specific reason as appropriate in the case itself \u2014 sought to disclose outside the Department a report prepared by a Special Counsel containing substantive and voluminous case information. Until now,\" she wrote on Tuesday.",
      "Smith, who resigned as special counsel earlier this month, submitted to former Attorney General Merrick Garland a two-volume report on his investigations involving Mr. Trump. The first volume, related to his investigation into the president's alleged efforts to subvert the transfer of power after the 2020 election, was released to the public days before Mr. Trump was inaugurated.",
      "But Garland said the second volume, about the classified documents case, would not be available to the American people because proceedings involving Nauta and de Oliveira are ongoing. Instead, the attorney general said the report would only be available to the top Republicans and Democrats on the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, and only if they agreed not to share information about it.",
      "Nauta and de Oliveira sought to completely shield the full report, arguing its disclosure would unfairly prejudice potential future criminal proceedings against them. Cannon last week cleared the way for the Justice Department to release the first volume, on the 2020 election case, but ordered a hearing on whether the second volume should be available to lawmakers.",
      "She also reviewed that part of the report herself, and said in her order that it contains \"detailed and voluminous discovery information\" covered by a protective order issued at an earlier stage in the case. Cannon wrote that Garland's proposal would risk prejudicing the ongoing case.",
      "\"The bare wishes of one attorney general with 'limited time' in office to comply with a non-existent 'historical practice' of releasing special counsel reports in the pendency of criminal proceedings is not a valid reason,\" she wrote. \"And surely it does not override the obvious constitutional interests of defendants in this action and this court's duty to protect the integrity of this proceeding.\"",
      "The judge, appointed by Mr. Trump in 2020, rebuffed the Justice Department's assertions that there is interest by Congress in the unreleased portion of the report, noting there has been no subpoena for its release and no record of any lawmaker seeking to review it. There is also no pending legislation on the subject, she said.",
      "Cannon wrote that statements by prosecutors about Garland's desire to disclose the report to the four leaders of the Judiciary Committees \"do not reflect well on the department.\"",
      "\"[T]he Department offers no valid justification for the purportedly urgent desire to release to members of Congress case information in an ongoing criminal proceeding,\" she said.",
      "The judge also said that given the \"very strong public interest\" in the case involving Nauta and de Oliveira, there is a \"reasonable likelihood\" that review by lawmakers would lead to the public dissemination of all or part of the report involving the classified documents investigation.",
      "In the summer of 2023, Smith\u00a0brought charges against Mr. Trump, alongside Nauta and de Oliveira, for allegedly holding onto classified documents after leaving office the first time in January 2021 and obstructing the Justice Department's investigation. The president and his co-defendants pleaded not guilty to all charges.",
      "But last July, Cannon dismissed the indictment\u00a0on the grounds that Smith was unlawfully appointed special counsel. The former special counsel appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta.",
      "After Mr. Trump was elected president last November, Smith asked the appeals court to drop the case against Mr. Trump, citing longstanding Justice Department policy that forbids the prosecution of a sitting president. The 11th Circuit agreed to do so, but the case is moving forward with Nauta and de Oliveira as co-defendants.",

      "\"As we learn more about the transmission of H5N1 in animal food, there are several practices that the FDA is encouraging pet food manufacturers and others in the supply chain to use to significantly minimize or prevent H5N1 transmission through animal food,\" the agency said.",
      "The move also prompted the federal Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to step up oversight of turkey slaughter, after a bird flu strain detected in raw pet food and an infected cat was linked to a turkey flock.",
      "Under the program, APHIS said it would require turkeys to undergo isolation and extra testing in some states before they could be slaughtered.",
      "Health officials in California last year had warned against feeding pets recalled raw milk and a local raw pet food brand, Monarch Raw Pet Food, after a probe of cat deaths. Monarch has disputed the allegation, saying there is \"no credible evidence\" that their products were to blame.",
      "Oregon's agriculture department also warned of an outbreak last year also linked to raw turkey pet food by Northwest Naturals, which had been sold in a dozen states and Canada. Officials in Oregon confirmed to CBS News this month that the FDA had taken over the investigation.",

      "This winter's migration started around a month later than usual, U.S. officials say, delaying when the surge of bird flu began to hit farmers hard.",
      "\"Apparently it was a very seasonally warm fall and early winter further north, and so that kept a lot of those birds up co-mingling with each other further north, before they started the fall migration,\" said Alex Turner, the USDA's national incident coordinator for the outbreak.",

      "\"Our pain is great,\" Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya told reporters at the Kartalkaya resort, about 100 miles northwest of the capital Ankara. \"Sixty-six citizens lost their lives and 51 others wounded.\"",
      "Other cabinet members also came to the scene of the disaster and said the blaze had been contained. The fire broke out at 3:27 am (7:27 p.m. Monday Eastern ) in the 12-story Grand Kartal hotel, which has wooden cladding, Yerlikaya said earlier on X.",
      "Yerlikaya said 238 people were registered guests at the hotel when the fire broke out amid a tourism peak for the resort due to a two-week school holiday.",
      "Turkish authorities detained four people, including the owner of the hotel, \"as part of an investigation led by six prosecutors,\" Turkey's Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said in a post on social media. The hotel's owner was among those detained for questioning, according to the justice minister. A panel of five people with expertise relevant to the case will also assist in the probe, he said.",
      "The fire is believed to have started in the restaurant and spread quickly, though it was not immediately clear what caused it. Tourism Minister Mehmet Nuri Ersoy told reporters the hotel had undergone inspections in 2021 and 2024, saying \"no negative situation regarding fire competence\" was recorded by the fire department, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Some witnesses and reports suggested the hotel's fire detection system failed to operate. Atakan Yelkovan, a guest staying on the third floor, told AP it took firefighters about an hour to arrive at the scene. Part of the hotel backs onto a cliff, which made it harder for firefighters to tackle the blaze.",
      "Video aired on Turkish television showed huge plumes of smoke rising into the sky with a snowcapped mountain behind the hotel.",
      "\"I heard screams around midnight, (hotel) residents were shouting for help,\" Baris Salgur, who works at a nearby hotel, told NTV television. \"They asked for a blanket, saying they will jump... we did what we could, we brought rope, pillows, we brought a sofa. Some people threw themselves once the flames approached them.\"",
      "Officials said they feared the number of dead could still rise.",
      "Video showed the wrecked lobby of the hotel with shards of glass on the floor, the reception desk and the wooden furniture inside charred black.",
      "Authorities warned the building could collapse.",
      "A survivor who managed to escape the flames told local media that no alarms rang at the hotel when the fire started, complaining of a lack of any safety measures such as fire stairs or smoke detectors.",
      "\"I pray to God for mercy upon our citizens who lost their lives in the fire,\" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on X.",
      "He said he wished a speedy recovery to the injured affected by \"this tragic accident,\" adding that an investigation had been launched. Erdogan also declared Wednesday a day of national mourning in response to the fire, ordering all flags at government buildings and Turkish diplomatic missions abroad to be lowered to half-staff.",

    "story": [
      "Islamabad, Pakistan \u2014 A prisoner swap between the United States and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban regime saw two Americans freed in exchange for a Taliban figure imprisoned for life in California on drug trafficking and terrorism charges, officials told The Associated Press on Tuesday. In a statement, the family of Ryan Corbett, an American man held by the Taliban since the summer of 2022, said he was released as part of the deal.",
      "The Taliban-run Afghan Foreign Ministry announced the swap, saying two U.S. citizens had been exchanged for Khan Mohammed, who was sentenced to two terms of life imprisonment in 2008 in the U.S. The Taliban did not identify the Americans being released in the deal.",
      "Corbett, who lived in Afghanistan with his family at the time of the 2021 collapse of the U.S.-backed government, was abducted by the Taliban in August 2022 while on a business trip.",
      "The deal, the terms of which were not immediately confirmed by U.S. officials, came as former President Joe Biden, who oversaw the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, handed power over to returning President Trump. Members of Corbett's family were on stage Monday with Mr. Trump during his Inaugural Parade at Washington's Capital One Arena, along with family members of\u00a0Israeli hostages\u00a0held in Gaza.",
      "Corbett was considered by the U.S. government to have been wrongfully detained by the Taliban, and talks were underway in the final days of the Biden administration for a trade but had fallen through.",
      "The Taliban praised the swap as a step toward the \"normalization\" of ties between the U.S. and Afghanistan, but that likely remains a tall order as most countries in the world still don't recognize the militants' rule.",
      "\"Our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,\" the Corbett family said in their statement. They thanked both Mr. Trump and Biden, as well as many officials of both administrations, for their efforts in freeing him.",
      "Corbett's family also praised the Middle East nation of Qatar for its \"vital role in facilitating Ryan's release, and for their visits to Ryan as the United States' Protecting Power in Afghanistan.\"",
      "Energy-rich Qatar, which has hosted negotiations between the U.S. and Taliban over the years, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "A source close to Taliban Interior Minister Sirajudding Haqqani told CBS News' Ahmad Mukhtar that the second American released as part of the swap was William McKenty, the same name reported earlier by both CNN and The New York Times, citing anonymous U.S. officials. The source told CBS News that the UAE and Qatar had played a role in the prisoner exchange. No other details have emerged about McKenty, or what he might have been doing in Afghanistan.",
      "Mohammed, 55, was a prisoner in California after his 2008 conviction. The Bureau of Prisons early Tuesday listed Mohammed as not being in their custody.",
      "Mohammed was detained on the battlefield in Afghanistan's Nangarhar province and later taken to the U.S. A federal jury convicted him on charges of securing heroin and opium that he knew were bound for the United States and, in doing so, assisting terrorism activity.",
      "The Justice Department at the time referred to Mohammed as a \"a violent jihadist and narcotics trafficker\" who \"sought to kill U.S. soldiers in Afghanistan using rockets.\" He was the first person to be convicted on U.S. narco-terrorism laws.",
      "Before Biden left office, his administration had been trying to work out a deal to free Corbett as well as George Glezmann and Mahmood Habibi in exchange for Muhammad Rahim, one of the remaining detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Last week,\u00a0Biden spoke with relatives of the three Americans\u00a0though there was no deal to get them back at that time, family members said.",
      "Glezmann, an airline mechanic from Atlanta, was taken by the Taliban's intelligence services in December 2022 while traveling through the country. Habibi, an Afghan American businessman who worked as a contractor for a Kabul-based telecommunications company, also went missing in 2022. The Taliban has denied that it has Habibi.",
      "In a statement released Tuesday by the family of Mahmood Habibi, one of the detained man's brothers, Ahmad Habibi, said they were \"grateful that Ryan and William will be reunited with their families,\" and that they were \"confident that the Trump Administration will make a greater effort to bringing home my brother.\"",
      "\"We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him. My brother is an innocent man who has been held away from his wife, young daughter, and elderly parents for over two years,\" said Ahmad Habibi, adding that his family had been \"frustrated\" by the Biden administration's efforts to free his brother.",
      "\"It was our hope that Ryan, George and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,\" the Corbett family said. \"We recognize the immense privilege of our family's reunion today, and pledge to keep praying \u2014 and fighting \u2014 for George and Mahmoud's swift release.\"",
      "Brian Hughes, the spokesperson for the National Security Council, said in a statement, \"We celebrate the release of Ryan Corbett and William McKenty who will soon reunited with their families and loved ones, and also thank the Government of Qatar for their assistance. The Trump Administration will continue to demand the release of all Americans held by the Taliban, especially in light of the billions of dollars in U.S. aid they've received in recent years.\"",
      "A Trump administration official said the national security team was informed by the Biden administration of the deal.",
      "The Taliban called the exchange the result of \"long and fruitful negotiations\" with the U.S. and said it was a good example of solving problems through dialogue.",
      "\"The Islamic Emirate looks positively at the actions of the United States of America that help the normalization and development of relations between the two countries,\" it said.",

      "In a statement released by his office, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said IDF and police forces \"launched an extensive and significant military operation to eradicate terrorism in Jenin.\"",
      "Dubbing the operation \"Iron Wall,\" Netanyahu called it \"another step towards achieving the goal we set \u2014 strengthening security\" in the West Bank and acting \"methodically and resolutely against the Iranian axis wherever it sends its arms.\"",
      "Throughout the 15-month Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, Jenin has been a focus of Israeli raids into the occupied territory. The Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank, launched its own raid into the area late last year.",
      "Violence in the West Bank has surged during the war in Gaza, with Israel saying it is operating to stamp out Iranian-backed militancy. The Palestinian Health Ministry says more than 800 people have been killed in Israeli raids in the West Bank there since the war began after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Several Israelis have also been killed recently in attacks by Palestinians.",
      "The IDF launched its new operation hours after President Trump rescinded Biden-era executive orders that had authorized U.S. sanctions against people who undermine peace in the occupied West Bank, mainly targeting Israeli settlers",
      "The Biden administration used the executive order to impose a handful of sanctions on extremist settlers accused of using violence against Palestinians who live in the West Bank.",
      "Israeli settlements and smaller outposts across the West Bank are illegal under international law. The U.N.'s top court, the International Court of Justice, ruled last summer that Israel should stop settlement activity and end what it called the \"illegal\" occupation \u2014 a ruling that was not legally binding, and which was condemned by the Israeli government.",
      "Settlers have celebrated the incoming Trump administration, believing it will take a more favorable approach to illegal settlements in the Palestinian territory.",
      "During his first term, Mr. Trump took unprecedented steps to support Israel's territorial claims, including recognizing Jerusalem as its capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there, and recognizing Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights.",
      "After Mr. Trump's reelection in November, Israel's far-right minister of finance suggested the country would look to annex the occupied West Bank in 2025.",
      "Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a member of Israel's far-right Religious Zionist Party, said at the time that he believed Israel could work with the second Trump administration to promote annexation of the West Bank.",

In addition to immediately clamping down on immigration across the southern border, Mr. Trump signed executive orders to pull the U.S. out of the World Health Organization and the Paris Climate Agreement.",
      "While some international leaders congratulated Mr. Trump, others were unhappy with his first actions as president. Below is a look at reactions from around the world to Mr. Trump's initial moves.",
      "Reaction to Trump announcement on U.S. withdrawal from WHO",
      "The WHO is the United Nations agency responsible for global public health. It has nearly 200 member states and plays a lead role in coordinating international responses to disease outbreaks and other health matters. Mr. Trump's announcement started a year-long notice period for the U.S. to formally withdraw from the WHO and halt all financial contributions to the body.",
      "Speaking Monday, Mr. Trump accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic and other global health crises, saying the agency had failed to act free of \"inappropriate political influence of WHO member states\" and had required \"unfairly onerous payments\" from the U.S., disproportionate to what some other, larger countries, such as China, were paying.",
      "\"The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the Organization,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on social media.",
      "\"For over seven decades, WHO and the USA have saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats. Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,\" Tedros said. \"We hope the United States will reconsider and we look forward to engaging in constructive dialogue to maintain the partnership between the USA and WHO, for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency quoted Germany's health minister as saying Tuesday that Berlin would try to convince Mr. Trump to change his mind on the WHO, while China's foreign ministry spokesperson told reporters \"the role of the WHO should only be strengthened, not weakened.\"",
      "\"China will, as always, support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities,\" spokesman Guo Jiakun said, according to the AFP news agency, adding that Beijing would \"work towards building a shared community of health for humanity.\"",
      "Reaction to Trump saying U.S. will pull out of Paris Climate Accords",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's announcement that the U.S. would pull out of the Paris Climate Accords \u2014 a move that will take a year to complete and that he initiated during his first term, too \u2014 U.N. Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell said anyone not embracing clean energy would miss out on \"massive profits, millions of manufacturing jobs and clean air.\"",
      "The Paris agreement is a legally binding treaty to address climate change that was adopted by 196 parties in 2015. Its goal is to prevent \"the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\" and try \"to limit the temperature increase to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels.\"",
      "\"Ignoring it only sends all that vast wealth to competitor economies, while climate disasters like droughts, wildfires and superstorms keep getting worse, destroying property and businesses, hitting nationwide food production, and driving economy-wide price inflation,\" Stiell said, according to Reuters, adding that there was still room for the new Trump administration to change course.",
      "\"The door remains open to the Paris agreement, and we welcome constructive engagement from any and all countries,\" Stiell said.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Union's governing European Commission, said Tuesday at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that Europe would \"stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.\"",
      "She vowed that the the 27-nation EU bloc would adhere to the terms and goals of the Paris agreement, which she said \"continues to be the best hope for all humanity.\"",
      "\"Unusual fear\" in Europe",
      "Georgios Samaras, a lecturer in public policy at King's College London, said European leaders would need to decide how to position themselves in regard to Mr. Trump and his policies.",
      "\"I've spoken to colleagues in the European Union, and there is unusual fear right now in the commission, because they don't know what's next,\" Samaras told CBS News. \"I believe that Trump is going to choose his allies very carefully, and those who don't bend the knee will face the consequences of Trump's agenda.\"",
      "\"The EU will either find a way to communicate with Trump or, similarly, they might be targeted,\" he predicted.",
      "Mr. Trump has threatened the EU with tariffs, but Von der Leyen sent him her \"best wishes.\"",
      "\"The EU looks forward to working closely with you to tackle global challenges,\" the EU leader said in a social media post. \"Together, our societies can achieve greater prosperity and strengthen their common security. This is the enduring strength of the transatlantic partnership.\"",
      "Reaction from other global voices to Trump's inauguration",
      "The initial reactions from many world leaders were congratulatory, despite simmering tension between Mr. Trump and some longstanding U.S. allies.",
      "\"For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,\" U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has been repeatedly attacked in recent weeks by Trump appointee Elon Musk on social media, said. \"With President Trump's longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.\"",
      "In his final days in office, former President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the U.S. list of state sponsored terrorism. Mr. Trump immediately reversed that move, which Cuba's president Miquel Diaz-Canal called, \"an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.\"",
      "Mr. Trump again threatened in his inaugural address to take back control of the Panama Canal.",
      "Panama's President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino responded shortly after his speech, reiterating in a statement that \"the Canal is and will continue being Panamanian, and its administration will continue being under Panama's control with respect to its permanent neutrality.\"",
      "Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum responded to Mr. Trump's executive orders paving the way for U.S. troops to be sent to the southern border and designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum said that the orders were similar to policies under Mr. Trump's previous administrations and that Mexico was, therefore, prepared.",
      "\"They can act in their territories within the framework of their constitution. What we say is: Stay away from our sovereignty, from our independence. We can coordinate, but we are a free, independent and sovereign country and we are going to seek coordination,\" Sheinbaum said.",
      "She also criticized Mr. Trump's order to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America.\"",
      "\"For us and for the whole world, it is still the Gulf of Mexico,\" she said.",
      "Mr. Trump did not immediately impose new tariffs on China, as he'd indicated he might, and he recently delayed a ban on Chinese-owned TikTok that was conceived under his previous administration and passed under Biden's administration.",
      "\"China stands ready to work with the new U.S. government under the strategic guidance of the two presidents,\" China's foreign ministry spokesman Guo said Tuesday, according to the South China Morning Post newspaper. \"Economic ties between China and the US are essentially mutually beneficial despite differences and disputes. China believes there is space for cooperation and dialogue in this trade area and both countries can engage in more talks.\"",

      "In Iran, the semi-official student news agency cited the country's Deputy Foreign Minister for Legal and International Affairs Kazem Gharibabadi as saying Tehran, as in the past, was ready to engage in direct negotiations with the new U.S. administration with the aim of getting sanctions lifted.",
      "\"If there will be also the same intention on the other side, the talks will take place and can reach a conclusion,\" Gharibabadi said.",
      "On the streets of Tehran, Iranians who spoke with CBS News voiced apprehension, given Mr. Trump's previous hard line on policy regarding their country and the devastating impact of the sanctions already in place.",
      "Kimia, a 26-year-old art graduate who declined to give her full name told CBS News that she hoped Mr. Trump would resume his \"maximum pressure\" tactic against her country's leaders, to force it to change its domestic policies and allocate more resources for the good of the Iranian people \"rather than other countries.\"",

      "According to the investigation, two young prostitutes had reported having been bothered by Charuel while he was leaving a bar near the train station in the city of Nancy on the night of Feb. 19, 2003.",
      "He was then taken into a car, a black BMW, by two men, who were later identified as Christian Rad and Vasile Ostas.",

      "Deep-sea sea bugs, or the Bathynomus\u00a0species, have been eaten regularly in Vietnam since 2017, according to the researchers, who published their findings in the science journal ZooKeys. The crustaceans, members of the isopod family, are fished from deep water, usually in the South China Sea, and sold in restaurants and other eateries. The study was exploring the sudden popularity of the crustaceans.",
      "While conducting the research, scientists noticed a species they didn't recognize. All isopods are characterized by hard, protective exoskeletons and seven pairs of legs, but they're usually incredibly small, about 2.5 centimeters. The new species had evolved to be much larger, around 30 centimeters, the researchers said. There are only 11 known \"supergiant\" and nine \"giant\" Bathynomus species, and this is only the second supergiant to be found in the South China Sea.",
      "The species was officially named\u00a0Bathynomus vaderi, after \"Star Wars\" villain Darth Vader. Researchers said the crustacean's head resembled Vader's iconic helmet.",

      "A White House statement Monday night said the U.S. would withdraw \"due to the organization's mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\"",
      "It also accused the WHO of demanding \"unfairly onerous payments from the United States, far out of proportion with other countries' assessed payments.\"",
      "The order said Mr. Trump was sending a presidential letter to the United Nations secretary-general to formally notify him of the U.S. plan to withdraw \u2014 a process that takes one year, under the rules.",
      "The World Health Organization responded by calling on the U.S. government to reconsider its decision to withdraw, saying in a statement\u00a0that together they had \"saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats.\"",
      "The WHO also pointed to the fact that in recent years it has made \"the largest set of reforms in its history.\"",
      "A U.S. withdrawal from the organization would not only sever its funding next year \u2014 the U.S. is its\u00a0largest donor\u00a0\u2014 but the order also instructs the federal government's staff to stop working with the group \u2014 something U.S. health officials do on a wide range of health issues of global concern.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Monday he will again withdraw the United States from the landmark Paris climate agreement, dealing a blow to worldwide efforts to combat global warming and once again distancing the U.S. from its closest allies.",
      "The announcement, which came the day\u00a0Mr. Trump was sworn in to a second term, echoed Trump's actions in 2017, when he announced that the U.S. would abandon the global Paris accord. President Biden later rejoined.",
      "As he signed a series of executive actions following his inauguration, Mr. Trump said, \"I'm immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accords.\" He also signed a letter informing the U.N. of his decision.",
      "It takes a full year to formally withdraw from the agreement, so while Mr. Trump has announced his intentions, it will not go into effect until Jan. 20, 2026.",
      "The pact is aimed at limiting long-term global warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels or, failing that, keeping temperatures at least well below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) above pre-industrial levels. The U.S. is one of the world's top carbon polluting nations.",
      "The 2015 Paris agreement is voluntary and allows nations to provide targets to cut their own emissions of greenhouse gases from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas. Those targets are supposed to become more stringent over time, with countries facing a February 2025 deadline for new individual plans.",
      "The outgoing Biden administration last month offered a plan to cut U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by more than 60% by 2035.",
      "Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a key architect of the Paris agreement, called the planned U.S. withdrawal unfortunate but said action to slow climate change \"is stronger than any single country's politics and policies.\"",
      "The global context for Trump's action is \"very different to 2017,\" Tubiana said, adding that \"there is unstoppable economic momentum behind the global transition, which the U.S has gained from and led but now risks forfeiting.\"",
      "The International Energy Agency expects the global market for key clean energy technologies to triple to more than $2 trillion by 2035, she said.",
      "\"The impacts of the climate crisis are also worsening. The terrible wildfires in Los Angeles are the latest reminder that Americans, like everyone else, are affected by worsening climate change,\" Tubiana said.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom put it bluntly in a statement Monday night, sharing photos of the devastating L.A. fires and the message: \"If you don't believe in science, believe your own damn eyes.\"",
      "Dr. Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS, called the withdrawal \"a travesty.\"",
      "\"Such a move is in clear defiance of scientific realities and shows an administration cruelly indifferent to the harsh climate change impacts that people in the United States and around the world are experiencing. Pulling out of the Paris Agreement is an abdication of responsibility and undermines the very global action that people at home and abroad desperately need,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Gina McCarthy, who served as White House climate adviser under President Joe Biden, a Democrat, said that if Trump, a Republican, \"truly wants America to lead the global economy, become energy independent and create good-paying American jobs,\" then he must \"stay focused on growing our clean energy industry. Clean technologies are driving down energy costs for people all across our country.\"",
      "The world is now long-term 2.3 degrees Fahrenheit (1.3 degrees Celsius) above mid-1800s temperatures. Most but not all climate monitoring agencies said global temperatures last year passed the warming mark of 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, and all said it was the warmest year on record.",
      "Without greater reductions over the next few years, the world is on a path to see a temperature increase of more than 3 degrees Celsius, according to an October\u00a0U.N. report, which warned such an outcome \"would bring debilitating impacts to people, planet and economies.\"",
      "The withdrawal process from the Paris accord takes one year. Trump's previous withdrawal took effect the day after the 2020 presidential election, which he lost to Biden.",
      "While the first Trump-led withdrawal from the landmark U.N. agreement \u2014 adopted by 196 nations \u2014 shocked and angered nations across the globe, \"not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,\" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G.",
      "Instead, other nations renewed their commitment to slowing climate change, along with investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others in the U.S., Meyer and other experts said.",
      "Still, they lamented the loss of U.S. leadership in global efforts to slow climate change, even as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.",
      "\"Clearly America is not going to play the commanding role in helping solve the climate crisis, the greatest dilemma humans have ever encountered,\" said climate activist and writer Bill McKibben. \"For the next few years the best we can hope is that Washington won't manage to wreck the efforts of others.\"",
      "About half of Americans \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" oppose U.S. action to withdraw from the climate accord, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly in favor, according according to a poll\u00a0from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Only about 2 in 10 U.S. adults \"somewhat\" or \"strongly\" in favor of withdrawing from the Paris agreement, while about one-quarter are neutral.",
      "Much of the opposition to U.S. withdrawal comes from Democrats, but Republicans display some ambivalence as well. Slightly less than half of Republicans are in favor of withdrawing from the climate accord, while about 2 in 10 are opposed.",
      "China several years ago passed the United States as the world's largest annual carbon dioxide emitting nation. The U.S. \u2014 the second biggest annual carbon polluting country \u2014 put 4.9 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide in the air in 2023, down 11% from a decade earlier, according to the scientists who track emissions for the Global Carbon Project.",
      "But carbon dioxide lasts in the atmosphere for centuries, so the United States has put more of the heat-trapping gas that is now in the air than any other nation. The U.S. is responsible for nearly 22% of the carbon dioxide put in the atmosphere since 1950, according to Global Carbon Project.",
      "While global efforts to fight climate change continued during Trump's first term, many experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries, especially China, could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.",
      "Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate change executive secretary, held out hope that the U.S. would continue to embrace the global clean energy boom.",

      "The ceasefire came into effect Sunday after an initial three-hour delay, during which almost 20 more Palestinians were killed, according to medics in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Under the terms of the deal, which the U.S. helped broker along with Qatar and Egypt, three Israeli hostages were released by Hamas on Sunday after the fighting stopped. Just after midnight local time, 90 Palestinian prisoners were freed from an Israeli prison in the occupied West Bank.",
      "After more than a year of devastating war sparked by Hamas' brutal Oct. 7, 2023 terror attack, which saw militants kill some 1,200 people and kidnap 251 others, the people of Gaza heard the sound of children playing Monday instead of the thunder of fighter jets and airstrikes, observed Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the United Nations' agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, in a statement posted on social media.",
      "\"Our teams reported a good first day of the ceasefire,\" he said, adding that aid and some commercial supplies had started flowing smoothly into Gaza on Sunday. Along with the reciprocal release of hostages and prisoners, that is the other major component of the ceasefire deal. At least 600 aid trucks per day are supposed to enter Gaza, carrying everything from desperately needed food and medicine to fuel for generators.",

Still, the Hamas-run Gaza City Municipality said in a statement Monday that it started to at least clear the main roads, which had been closed during the war.",
      "That will help as tens of thousands of displaced civilians plod back toward their towns and villages across the enclave, to assess the damage caused to their homes, and attempt to make use of whatever they can salvage from the ruins.",

      "Civil Defense rescue teams have continued recovering the decomposing bodies of dozens of people killed during the war, both from underneath the rubble of destroyed buildings and from the streets. The Civil Defense has estimated that some 10,000 bodies could still be buried under the rubble of demolished homes in Gaza.",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry said Monday that hospitals across the enclave had received the bodies of 122 people recovered since the ceasefire took effect alone, including 62 pulled from rubble, raising the total number of fatalities in Gaza since the war began to 47,035. The ministry does not distinguish between combatant and civilian casualties, but says the vast majority of those killed have been civilians, including tens of thousands of women and children.",
      "Joyous reunions for 3 Israeli families, hope for dozens more",
      "A Red Cross convoy driving into Gaza City on Sunday was the first sign that Hamas was keeping its end of the bargain.\u00a0 But the hostage handover was chaotic; heavily armed Hamas fighters surrounded and climbed over the vehicles \u2014 a clear display of force and resilience after more than a year of war against Israel's vastly superior military.",
      "But soon the world and the desperate families back home got a first glimpse of the three women being released as they bolted between cars, and to freedom.",
      "Held hostage in fear for 15 months by Hamas, 24-year-old Romi Gonen, 31-year-old Doron Steinbrecher and 28-year-old Emily Damari were finally on their way to being back in the eager arms of their loved ones. The three women \u2014 including Damari, an Israeli-British national who lost two fingers during the Oct. 7 attack when she was abducted \u2014 were all reunited with their mothers as soon as they reached Israel.",
      "\"Yesterday, I was finally able to give Emily the hug that I have been dreaming of,\" Damari's mother Mandy said in a statement released Monday. \"I am relieved to report that after her release, Emily is doing much better than any of us could ever have anticipated\u2026 In Emily's own words, she is the happiest girl in the world; she has her life back.\"",
      "Even in her moment of intense joy, Mandy Damari stressed that other families were still waiting to share in the elation.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0A British teen pleaded guilty Monday to murdering three girls and attempting to kill 10 other people in what a prosecutor said was a \"meticulously planned\" stabbing rampage at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in England last summer. Axel Rudakubana, 18, entered the surprise plea as jury selection had been expected to begin at the start of his trial in Liverpool Crown Court.",
      "The July 29 stabbings sent shock waves across the U.K. and led to a week of widespread rioting across parts of England and Northern Ireland after the suspect was falsely identified as an asylum-seeker who had recently arrived in Britain by boat. He was actually born in Wales.",
      "The rampage occurred on the first day of summer vacation when the little girls at the Hart Space, a facility hidden behind a row of houses, were in a class to learn yoga and dance to the songs of Taylor Swift. What was supposed to be a day of joy turned to terror and heartbreak when Rudakubana, armed with a knife, intruded and began stabbing the girls and their teacher in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England.",
      "\"This was an unspeakable attack \u2014 one which left an enduring mark on our community and the nation for its savagery and senselessness,\" Deputy Chief Crown Prosecutor Ursula Doyle said. \"A day which should have been one of carefree innocence; of children enjoying a dance workshop and making friendship bracelets, became a scene of the darkest horror as Axel Rudakubana carried out his meticulously planned rampage.\"",
      "Prosecutors haven't said what they believe led Rudakubana \u2014 who was days shy of his 18th birthday \u2014 to commit the atrocities but Doyle said it was clear he had a \"a sickening and sustained interest in death and violence.\"",
      "Rudakubana had consistently refused to speak in court and did so once again when asked to identify himself at the start of the proceedings. But he broke his silence when he was read the 16-count indictment and asked to enter a plea, replying \"guilty\" to each charge.",
      "He pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, 10 counts of attempted murder and additional charges related to possessing the poison ricin and for having an al-Qaeda manual.",
      "Rudakubana faces life imprisonment when sentenced Thursday, Justice Julian Goose said.",
      "Defense lawyer Stanley Reiz said he would present information to the judge about Rudakubana's mental health that may be relevant to his sentence.",
      "The surviving victims and family members of those killed were absent in court because they had expected to arrive Tuesday for opening statements.",
      "Goose asked the prosecutor to apologize on his behalf that they were not present to hear Rudakubana plead guilty.",
      "He pleaded guilty to murdering Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Bebe King, 6.",
      "Eight other girls, ranging in age from 7 to 13, were wounded, along with instructor Leanne Lucas and Jonathan Hayes, who worked in a business next door and intervened. Fifteen other girls, as young as 5, were at the class but uninjured. Under a court order, none of the surviving girls can be named.",
      "King Charles III and Taylor Swift met separately with some of the victims' families after the attack.",
      "Police said the stabbings weren't classified as acts of terrorism because the motive wasn't known.",
      "Several months after his arrest at the scene of the crime, Rudakubana was charged with additional counts for production of a biological toxin, ricin and possession of information likely to be useful to a person committing or preparing to commit an act of terrorism for having the manual in a document on his computer.",
      "Police said they found the evidence during a search of his family's home in a neighboring village.",
      "The day after the killings \u2014 and shortly after a peaceful vigil for the victims \u2014 a violent group attacked a mosque near the crime scene and pelted police officers with bricks and bottles and set fire to police vehicles.",
      "Rioting then spread to dozens of other towns over the next week when groups made up mostly of men mobilized by far-right activists on social media clashed with police during violent protests and attacked hotels housing migrants.",

Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where the community sometimes shames victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing.",
      "The nationwide outrage and protests were similar to those seen after the\u00a02012 gang-rape and murder\u00a0of a young woman on a moving New Delhi bus. That vicious attack prompted India to enact tougher laws against sexual violence, but according to the latest available government data, as recently as 2022 authorities were still registering about 90 rapes on average per day.",
      "The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. Four men sentenced to death for the 2012 crime were hanged in 2020.",
      "The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16.",

      "Oxfam International, in its latest assessment of global inequality timed to the opening of the World Economic Forum meeting, also predicts at least five trillionaires will crop up over the next decade. A year ago, the group forecast that only one trillionaire would appear during that time.",
      "OxFam's research adds weight to a warning by outgoing President Biden last week of a \"dangerous concentration of power in the hands of very few ultra-wealthy people.\" The group's sharp-edged report, titled \"Takers Not Makers,\" also says the number of people in poverty has barely budged since 1990.",
      "The World Economic Forum expects to host some 3,000 attendees, including business executives, academics, government officials, and civic group leaders at its annual meeting in the Alpine village of Davos.",
      "President-elect Donald Trump, who visited Davos twice during his first term and was set to take the oath of office on Monday, is expected to take part in the forum's event by video on Thursday. He has long championed wealth accumulation - including his own - and counts multibillionaire Elon Musk as a top adviser.",
      "\"What you're seeing at the moment is a billionaire president taking oaths today, backed by the richest man. So this is pretty much the jewel in the crown of the global oligarchies,\" Amitabh Behar, executive director of Oxfam International, said in an interview, referring to Trump and Musk.",
      "\"It's not about one specific individual. It's the economic system that we have created where the billionaires are now pretty much being able to shape economic policies, social policies, which eventually gives them more and more profit,\" he added.",
      "Like Biden's call for making billionaires \"begin to pay their fair share\" through the U.S. tax code, Oxfam - a global advocacy group - called on governments to tax the richest to reduce inequality and extreme wealth, and to \"dismantle the new aristocracy.\"",
      "The group called for steps like the break-up of monopolies, capping CEO pay, and regulation of corporations to ensure they pay \"living wages\" to workers.",
      "Many investors racked up strong gains in 2024, with strong performances for top tech companies and stock-market indexes like the S&P 500, as well as the price of gold and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.",

      "Citing World Bank data, the group pointed to lingering poverty, saying the number of people living on less than $6.85 per day has \"barely changed\" since 1990. Oxfam used Forbes' \"Real-Time Billionaire List\" as of end-November for data on the ultra-rich.",
      "By contrast, at least four new billionaires were \"minted\" every week in 2024, and three-fifths of billionaire wealth comes from inheritance, monopoly power or \"crony connections,\" it said.",
      "On average, Oxfam said, low- and middle-income countries are spending nearly half their national budgets on debt repayments. It also noted that life expectancy in Africa is just under 64 years of age, compared to over 79 years in Europe.",
      "Despite the growing gap between the \u00fcber rich and the poor, the annual Davos confab, which formally begins on Tuesday, will likely focus this year again on making money and doing deals, with strongman leaders on the rise in some Western countries and progressive causes like diversity and climate change waning in the business world.",
      "The continued rise of artificial intelligence as a tool for business to reap greater efficiencies will also again be a central theme in Davos, despite worries in many sectors that AI could upend many white-collar jobs and displace workers in an array of industries.",
      "Trump's return for a second term will likely be on many lips in Davos, as will lingering conflicts, including wars in Ukraine and Sudan, along with hopes for a continuation of a cease-fire that began on Sunday between Hamas and Israel, pausing their devastating 15-month war in Gaza.",
      "Forum organizers last week issued a survey conducted among 900 experts for \"Global Risks Report,\" which found that conflicts between countries was the top concern, followed by extreme weather, economic confrontation, misinformation and disinformation, and \"societal polarization\" - a nod to the gap between rich and poor.",

Scammers often target jobseekers randomly, hoping someone takes the bait. If you didn't apply, it's likely a scam. Always confirm directly with the company before proceeding.",
      "2. Verify recruiter credentials:\u00a0Always double-check the recruiter\u2019s details before responding to an email or clicking any links. Verify their email address, LinkedIn profile and company association. Legitimate companies will use official email domains, not free services like Gmail or Yahoo.",
      "3. Avoid downloading unsolicited files:\u00a0Be cautious of emails asking you to download any files or applications. Legitimate recruitment processes rarely require you to install software. If unsure, contact the company directly to confirm the request.",
      "4. Inspect links before clicking:\u00a0Hover over any links in the email to see their actual URL. Scammers often use URLs that mimic legitimate sites but have subtle differences. If a link looks suspicious, avoid clicking on it.",

    "published": "Thu, 16 Jan 2025 06:00:05 -0500",
    "summary": "Researchers found in a study that users of a robotic prosthetic hand could successfully grasp and move two objects at once without dropping them.",
    "story": [
      "Study participants successfully grasped and transported two objects at once without dropping them.",
      "Prosthetic hands have long struggled to replicate the dexterity and functionality of natural hands, often limiting users to a single grasp function at a time.",
      "This limitation has made everyday tasks, such as typing on a keyboard or braiding hair, challenging for those who rely on prosthetics.",
      "However, a groundbreaking study from Florida Atlantic University (FAU) offers promising advancements that could transform the experience of prosthetic hand users.",
      "I\u2019M GIVING AWAY THE LATEST & GREATEST AIRPODS PRO 2",
      "Man sporting wearable soft robotic armband (Florida Atlantic University)",
      "New technology enables users to grasp two objects at once",
      "Researchers at FAU's College of Engineering and Computer Science, in collaboration with the Charles E. Schmidt College of Science, conducted an innovative study that combined haptic feedback, electromyogram control and a wearable soft robotic armband. This study aimed to investigate whether users could control grip forces applied to two different objects simultaneously with a dexterous artificial hand.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The study's findings, published in Scientific Reports, demonstrated that multiple channels of haptic feedback allowed participants to successfully grasp and transport two objects at once without dropping them, even when visual feedback was obstructed.",
      "For example, participants managed to pinch a card between their fingers while simultaneously unscrewing a water bottle lid or toggling a light switch with their little finger.",
      "Prosthetic robot hand (Florida Atlantic University)",
      "NEW PROSTHETICS RESTORE NATURAL MOVEMENT VIA NERVE CONNECTION",
      "Multichannel soft robotic armband",
      "A key innovation in this research was the development of a multichannel soft robotic armband designed to convey artificial sensations of touch. This armband included soft actuators that provided proportional contact force feedback and vibrotactile stimulators that alerted users if they were about to drop or break an object. The armband's design allowed it to deliver haptic feedback at three critical points corresponding to the thumb, index and little fingers, effectively enhancing the user's ability to control multiple objects simultaneously.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Participants in the study reported that haptic feedback was significantly more important than visual feedback, especially since visual cues often failed to indicate when an object was about to be lost. This insight underscores the necessity of integrating tactile sensations into prosthetic technology.",
      "Prosthetic robot hand (Florida Atlantic University)",
      "BREAKTHROUGH PROSTHETIC FINGERS REVOLUTIONIZE THE LIVES OF AMPUTEES",
      "Implications for future prosthetic design",
      "The implications of this study extend beyond immediate user benefits; they suggest a paradigm shift in how prosthetic hands could be controlled in the future. By enabling refined dexterous control through enhanced sensory feedback, this research opens new pathways for individuals with upper limb loss to engage in complex tasks traditionally deemed impossible with current prosthetics. This includes activities such as playing musical instruments or performing intricate surgical procedures.",
      "In addition, the researchers noted that participants with limb loss performed as well as able-bodied subjects in key performance metrics during the tasks. This finding is particularly encouraging for clinical applications and indicates that advancements in technology can bridge gaps in functionality for users.",

      "As researchers continue to refine these prosthetic technology systems, we may soon see prosthetic hands that not only replicate but exceed the capabilities of natural hands, empowering users to reclaim their independence and engage fully in both everyday activities and specialized tasks. This innovative approach not only addresses existing limitations but also paves the way for future developments in assistive technologies for individuals with disabilities.",

      "Trump\u2019s border czar, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Tuesday that there would be \u201ctargeted enforcement action,\u201d which is similar to what ICE already does throughout the country every day. NBC News asked Homan how those operations would be different.",
      "\u201cWe have more people assigned to the mission,\u201d he said. He declined to say how many people had been assigned.",
      "Where could they be?",
      "While the Trump administration has not said where the first raids will take place, officials familiar with discussions about possible targets say they will be arresting migrants in major metropolitan cities first. Some of the locations under consideration include the Washington, D.C., area, Denver, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York.",
      "What\u2019s next for Trump\u2019s promises of mass deportation?",
      "Trump will most likely have to secure more funding from Congress to make good on his promises for mass deportations. He pledged in his inaugural address to deport \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of immigrants back to their home countries. But ICE is already short $230 million to fund its current level of deportations, which removed over 230,000 migrants last year.",
      "In his Day One executive orders, Trump declared a national emergency and ordered the military to help expand detention space and help transport migrants to use Defense Department funding on deportations."

      "President Donald Trump followed through Tuesday on several actions he pledged to take on his first day in office, but he still has some major items left on the to-do list he made for himself during the presidential campaign.",
      "Trump signed 46 executive orders and presidential actions on his first day back in the White House aimed at a variety of policy priorities he promised to address on Day One, such as border security, energy, production, transgender rights and pardoning the Jan. 6 Capitol rioters.",
      "A few big issues Trump promised to address were not among those actions, including tariffs and ending the war in Ukraine.",
      "Still on the to-do list",
      "Weeks after his election, Trump promised that he would sign an executive order to implement a 25% tariff on products imported from Mexico and Canada, two of America\u2019s biggest trading partners.",
      "\u201cOn January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social on Nov. 25.",
      "But Trump did not sign an order imposing tariffs on any foreign nation on his first day in office. Asked in the Oval Office on Monday evening, Trump said he was considering 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, two top trading partners for the United States. Asked when the tariffs would be imposed, he said, \u201cI think we\u2019ll do it Feb. 1st.\u201d",
      "Trump also said he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours of taking office \u2014 or even earlier.",
      "\u201cThat is a war that\u2019s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president,\u201d Trump said at a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in Philadelphia in September.",
      "Trump began backing off of that promise after the election. In remarks to the media at Mar-a-Lago, his estate in Florida, he was asked when he plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war. Trump said it would be inappropriate to hold the meeting before his inauguration.",
      "The war in Ukraine continues. When Trump was asked in the Oval Office on Monday about his promise to end the war on Day One, he said: \u201cWell, there\u2019s only half a day. I have another half a day left. We\u2019ll see. We want to get it done.\u201d",
      "Asked again later about his promise, Trump said he needed to speak with Putin and teased that the conversation \u201ccould be very soon.\u201d",
      "Trump also pledged at a rally in September that said the auto industry would be \u201cfueled by American energy,\u201d \u201csourced by American suppliers\u201d and built by American laborers on his \"first day in office.\u201d",
      "But Trump\u2019s executive orders did not include those specific measures aimed at the auto industry.",
      "Trump also pledged at a rally in New York City in late October that he would \"launch the largest deportation program in American history\" on his first day.",
      "While widespread deportations have not occurred yet, Trump did take steps to prioritize detaining, and ultimately deporting, people in the country illegally, an executive order titled \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion.\"",
      "In the order, Trump authorized relevant Cabinet heads \u201cto prioritize the prosecution of criminal offenses related to the unauthorized entry or continued unauthorized presence of aliens in the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump also called on the homeland security secretary to stand up the detention facilities required to carry out his deportation push.",
      "Checked off the to-do list",
      "Trump said on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in December that he would look to pardon those involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot on his \u201cfirst day\u201d in office, and he did just that. On Monday night he granted pardons to and commuted sentences for roughly 1,500 defendants charged with crimes related to the riot.",
      "Back in December, Trump did not rule out pardoning those who pleaded guilty to assaulting police officers, saying he would look at \u201ceverything.\u201d And he did end up issuing pardons to or commutations for those rioters, also calling for those in prison to be released \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "Trump pledged to end birthright citizenship on his first day in office, and he followed through, signing an order Monday that said children born to parents who are not legal, permanent residents should not be considered U.S. citizens. But his move was quickly met with legal challenges, and it could ultimately be struck down by the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump has been focused on the border since his first campaign for president, and it was a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign. On the trail, he pledged to \u201cterminate every open-borders policy of the Biden administration\u201d on Day One.",
      "What has that looked like on his first day in office? A slew of executive orders related to the border, including significant rollbacks of former President Joe Biden's policies and orders, as well as orders related to widespread deportations.",
      "In one order, Trump, among other policies:",
      "Revoked four specific Biden executive orders related to immigration enforcement and seeking asylum.\u00a0Declared it U.S. policy \u201cto faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens.\u201dCreated Homeland Security task forces in each state to further his immigration policies.\u00a0Required all people in the United States illegally to register with the government.Barred federal funding to \u201csanctuary\u201d jurisdictions that do not abide by federal immigration law.Asked his administration to \u201crescind\u201d Biden administration policies he claims \u201cled to the increased or continued presence of illegal aliens,\u201d including limiting parole and Temporary Protected Status.",

      "And another declares a national emergency on the border, calling for more resources to address it.",
      "Trump fulfilled his pledge to cancel what he described as Biden\u2019s \u201celectric vehicle mandate,\u201d signing an order undoing policies that he suggested favored electric vehicles, including subsidies and state emissions waivers.",
      "The order also required agencies to \u201cimmediately pause\u201d spending for Biden\u2019s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act, including funding for infrastructure related to electric vehicles.",
      "Trump told Fox News last month that he wanted to \u201cdrill, drill, drill\u201d on Day One, and he did take a step aimed at expanding fracking and drilling efforts in Alaska.",
      "Trump signed an order Monday titled \u201cUnleashing Alaska\u2019s Extraordinary Resource Potential,\u201d which included measures to deregulate fracking in Alaska and prioritize permitting a pipeline and \u201cexport infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Trump also declared a \u201cnational energy emergency,\u201d signing an executive order instructing agency heads in part to \u201cfacilitate the identification, leasing, siting, production, transportation, refining, and generation of domestic energy resources, including, but not limited to, on Federal lands.\u201d The order says \u201cenergy\u201d includes oil and natural gas, along with other energy resources.",
      "Trump also followed through on another Day One pledge related to wind energy. After he promised in May to block wind production on Day One, he signed an executive order Monday night temporarily halting the consideration of wind energy projects on federal land and water.",
      "Trump repeatedly accused Democrats and tech companies of working to censor social media platforms and promised a Day One executive order to \u201creclaim the right to Free Speech for all Americans.\u201d",
      "One of his early orders said the federal government is not allowed to facilitate conduct \u201cthat would unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen\u201d or use federal resources to do it.

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Senators received an affidavit Tuesday from the former sister-in-law of defense secretary nominee Pete Hegseth in which she says his behavior caused his second wife to fear for her safety. The receipt of the affidavit comes after Senate Armed Services Committee staffers were in contact with Hegseth's former sister-in-law for several days.",
      "The former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, submitted the affidavit in response to a Jan. 18 letter from Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., seeking \u201ca statement attesting to your personal knowledge about Mr. Hegseth\u2019s fitness to occupy this important position.\u201d",
      "Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, asked Danielle Hegseth to detail what she knew of \u201cinstances of abuse, or threats of abuse, perpetrated against any other person\u201d and \u201cmistreatment of a spouse, former spouse, or other members of his family,\u201d among other requests.",
      "Reed said in a statement Tuesday, \u201cAs I have said for months, the reports of Mr. Hegseth\u2019s history of alleged sexual assault, alcohol abuse, and public misconduct necessitate an exhaustive background investigation. I have been concerned that the background check process has been inadequate, and this sworn affidavit confirms that fact.\"",
      "He added that \u201cthe alleged pattern of abuse and misconduct by Mr. Hegseth is disturbing. This behavior would disqualify any service member from holding any leadership position in the military, much less being confirmed as the Secretary of Defense.\u201d",
      "Danielle describes in the affidavit allegations of volatile and threatening conduct by Hegseth that made his second wife, Samantha Hegseth, fear for her safety.\u00a0Among the allegations are that Samantha hid in a closet once from Hegseth, that she developed escape plans for use \u201cif she felt she needed to get away from Hegseth\u201d that would be activated with a code word and that she did once put the escape plans into action.",
      "At least 15 senators \u2014 including multiple Republicans \u2014 had reviewed the affidavit as of 2:30 p.m. ET, according to a Senate staffer.",
      "Two days before Congress received the affidavit, NBC News asked Hegseth's second wife, Samantha Hegseth, to comment on details of some of the allegations in the affidavit.",
      "In an email response Monday, Samantha Hegseth said: \u201cFirst and foremost, I have not and will not comment on my marriage to Pete Hegseth.\u00a0 I do not have representatives speaking on my behalf, nor have I ever asked anyone to share or speak about the details of my marriage on my behalf, whether it be a reporter, a committee member, a transition team member, etc.\u201d",
      "She added, \u201cI do not believe your information to be accurate, and I have cc\u2019d my lawyer.\u201d",
      "Asked what information was not accurate and for comment on the affidavit, she replied on Tuesday: \u201cThere was no physical abuse in my marriage. This is the only further statement I will make to you, I have let you know that I am not speaking and will not speak on my marriage to Pete. Please respect this decision.\u201d",
      "A lawyer for Pete Hegseth, Tim Parlatore, dismissed the allegations.",
      "\"Sam has never alleged that there was any abuse, she signed court documents acknowledging that there was no abuse and recently reaffirmed the same during her FBI interview. Belated claims by Danielle Dietrich, an anti-Trump far left Democrat who is divorced from Mr. Hegseth\u2019s brother and never got along with the Hegseth family, do nothing to change that,\" he said in a statement.",
      "\"After an acrimonious divorce, Ms. Dietrich has had an axe to grind against the entire Hegseth family,\" he added.\u00a0\"Ms. Dietrich admits that she saw nothing but is now falsely accusing Sam of lying to both the Court and to the FBI because of private, undocumented statements that she allegedly made 10 years ago.\"",
      "Both Pete Hegseth and Samantha Hegseth signed a 2021 court document that said neither parent claimed to be a victim of domestic abuse.",
      "Allegations in affidavit",
      "Danielle Hegseth says in the affidavit, a redacted copy of which has been reviewed by NBC News, \u201cI have chosen to come forward publicly, at significant personal sacrifice, because I am deeply concerned by what Hegseth\u2019s confirmation would mean for our military and our country.\u201d",
      "She adds that part of her reason for coming forward is \u201cbecause I have been assured that making this public statement will ensure that certain Senators who are still on the fence will vote against Hegseth\u2019s confirmation. But for that assurance I would not subject myself or others referred to in this statement to the public scrutiny this statement is likely to cause.\u201d",
      "The allegations in the affidavit paint a picture of Hegseth\u2019s strained relationship with Samantha Hegseth. The two married in 2010 and divorced in 2018. They have three children.",
      "Danielle decided to speak with the committee staff after consideration, sources said, but she notes in the affidavit that she had detailed the allegations in it to an FBI agent in a Dec. 30, 2024, interview conducted as part of its background investigation into Pete Hegseth.",
      "The committee\u2019s Republican chair and Democratic ranking member were not told about the information Danielle provided to the FBI when the Trump transition team briefed them about the results of Pete Hegseth\u2019s background check prior to the hearing, according to two sources with knowledge of the content of the briefing.",
      "According to the affidavit, Danielle Hegseth says she relayed additional information about Pete Hegseth to the FBI on Saturday, four days after Hegseth testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee as part of his confirmation process. The FBI declined to comment.",
      "Separately, Arthur Schwartz, an advisor to Hegseth and paid consultant to the Trump transition, said in an email on Monday, \u201cEven SASC Democrats found these allegations to be too flimsy to raise with Mr. Hegseth or their Republican colleagues on the committee, which says a lot about both the allegations and NBC\u2019s standards for publication.\u201d Schwartz did not respond to an email on Tuesday asking for comment on the existence of the affidavit.",
      "In the affidavit, Danielle Hegseth notes that \u201cmuch\u201d of what she knows about Samantha\u2019s situation she \u201clearned from her around the time of the events in question.\"",
      "\u201cHowever, I trust what Samantha told me for the reasons stated above, most critically because it was consistent with what I personally observed of Hegseth\u2019s erratic and aggressive behavior over many years,\u201d Danielle Hegseth says in the affidavit.",
      "She also says, \u201cI believe Hegseth has an alcohol abuse problem and was abusive to his ex-wife Samantha, as I understand those terms as a lay person.\"",
      "According to the affidavit, during the marriage, Samantha Hegseth developed and executed plans with members of Hegseth\u2019s family and mutual friends to help her escape \u201cif she felt she needed to get away from Hegseth.\u201d",
      "A person with indirect knowledge of Samantha Hegseth\u2019s alleged escape plans had told committee staffers about them, according to three sources familiar with the conversations. NBC News has also spoken with two other sources who had been aware of the plans before the committee staffers heard about them.",
      "The plans included what Danielle Hegseth refers to in the affidavit as a \u201csafe word/code word\u201d that Samantha could text her to let friends and family know that Pete Hegseth was in a potentially dangerous and volatile state at home and that she needed help.",
      "In the affidavit, Danielle Hegseth also says that one time, \u201csometime in 2015-2016,\u201d Samantha did text her one of the words and activated the escape plan.",
      "Danielle Hegseth also alleges in the affidavit that Samantha told her that on one occasion Samantha \u201chid in her closet from Hegseth because she feared for her personal safety.\u201d",
      "In the affidavit, Danielle Hegseth also details instances in which she says she was \u201ca witness to and even a victim of emotional abuse by Hegseth\u201d and says she \u201cpersonally witnessed Hegseth abusing alcohol numerous times.\u201d",
      "In 2009, Danielle says, Hegseth \u201cdrunkenly yelled in my face.\u201d In her account, \u201cHegseth was angry that I walked out of the room while he was telling a story. I don\u2019t remember the specifics of the story, but I remember it had a racial slant that bothered me. He followed me out of the room and yelled at me that I was disrespecting him by walking away.\u201d Danielle says \u201cit was very intimidating\u201d and that it \u201cwent on long enough\u201d that he had to be pulled away from her by another person.",
      "Danielle also alleges that she personally heard him make multiple misogynistic comments.",
      "According to the affidavit, she heard Hegseth \u201csay that women should not have the right to vote and that they should not work.\u201d",
      "She also recounts a night in 2013 in which Hegseth \u201cgot very drunk\u201d at a bar, \u201cdancing with gin and tonics in each hand and dropping several glasses on the dance floor, making a mess.\u201d Leaving the bar with Hegseth, she says, he \u201crepeatedly shouted \u2018No means yes!\u2019\u201d",
      "She also details an incident she did not witness but says she was told about. In 2009, she says, Hegseth was found at a strip club \u201cdrunk, in his military uniform, getting lap dances.\u201d",
      "Asked for comment about these allegations specifically, Parlatore said, \u201cThese claims are clearly and obviously false to any objective observer.\u201d",
      "Three days after Hegseth\u2019s confirmation hearing before the Armed Service committee, some Democratic staffers heard information now contained in the affidavit directly from Danielle for the first time, according to three sources.",
      "NBC News and other media organizations have reported concerns about Hegseth\u2019s drinking. If he is confirmed, Hegseth will take up a major position in President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, overseeing the Defense Department and its millions of employees spread over the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marines and beyond.",
      "The allegations also raise new questions about the scope and thoroughness of the FBI\u2019s background check of Hegseth, what members and staffers of the Armed Services Committee knew, and when, and what the Trump transition communicated to the committee before last week\u2019s confirmation hearing.",
      "A source familiar with the FBI\u2019s background check process told NBC News \u201cour hands are tied\u201d and expressed general frustration with the process. \u201cWe are a service provider,\u201d the source said, adding that the parameters of what the FBI can and should look into and the time given to complete its work is determined by the organization requesting it \u2014 in this case, the Trump transition team.",
      "\u201cThe point of a thorough FBI background check is to confirm that there is no derogatory information that would compromise a nominee\u2019s ability to do their job. The FBI process designed by the Trump Transition Team for Mr. Hegseth has been woefully inadequate,\u201d Reed said in a statement after the briefing, several days before Hegseth\u2019s confirmation hearing. He argued that \u201cinvestigators neglected to contact critical witnesses and whistleblowers.\u201d",
      "The FBI declined to comment on detailed questions from NBC News about Hegseth\u2019s background investigation.",
      "After his committee voted along party lines Monday to move Hegseth\u2019s nomination to the full Senate, Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., was asked whether he is concerned about more allegations against Hegseth coming to light.",
      "\u201cI think all of you probably heard a whisper of a rumor earlier today, which was anonymous, unsubstantiated and was contrary to some court documents that had been placed in the record at the hearing,\u201d Wicker said.",
      "Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., who aggressively question Hegseth at the hearing, said Danielle Hegseth's affidavit refuted that argument.",
      "\"So the claim that everything that\u2019s being alleged is an anonymous smear was false when it was stated last week, and it\u2019s even more false today,\" Kaine said. \"I think the issues that are raised are A, behavior, B, honesty with the committee in both his oral testimony and in his response to QFRs and, C, honesty with the Trump transition team that was vetting him to be secretary of defense.\"",
      "A Senate vote on Hegseth\u2019s nomination is expected as early as Thursday. To be confirmed, Hegseth would need only a simple majority, or 51 of the Senate\u2019s 53 Republicans."

    "story": [
      "The bishop leading the inaugural prayer service on Tuesday urged President Donald Trump to \"have mercy\" on his constituents, specifically naming LGBTQ people and immigrants.",
      "The sermon by the Right Rev. Mariann Edgar Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, was part of a larger post-Inauguration Day interfaith ceremony at Washington National Cathedral. Trump was seated in the first row alongside first lady Melania Trump, Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance during the service, a tradition undertaken by presidents of both parties.",
      "\u201cIn the name of our God, I ask you to have mercy upon the people in our country who are scared now,\u201d said Budde, who was looking directly at the president. \u201cThere are gay, lesbian and transgender children in Democratic, Republican and independent families. Some who fear for their lives.\u201d",
      "She added: \"They may not be citizens or have the proper documentation, but the vast majority of immigrants are not criminals. They pay taxes and are good neighbors. They are faithful members of our churches and mosques, synagogues.\"",
      "When Budde finished her sermon, Trump leaned over to say something to Vance, who shook his head in response.",
      "Later, as Trump was walking through the White House colonnade with his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, reporters asked him what he thought of the sermon. He asked the group, \u201cDid you like it? Find it exciting?\u201d He then added that he \u201cdidn\u2019t think it was a good service, no\u201d and said they \u201ccould do much better.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump administration did not immediately return a request for additional comment.",
      "Budde's remarks came a day after Trump was sworn in and signed  roughly 100 executive actions, some of which included policies affecting LGBTQ people and immigrants.",
      "Regarding LGBTQ people, Trump signed a sweeping executive order proclaiming that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, and\u00a0a second order ending\u00a0\u201cradical and wasteful\u201d diversity, equity and inclusion programs\u00a0inside federal agencies.",
      "The Trump administration also removed LGBTQ resources from government websites, including a page formerly on the State Department's website dedicated to advancing LGBTQ rights around the world.",
      "On immigration, Trump signed a flurry of executive actions, including ones that sought to end birthright citizenship, halt all refugee admissions and send the military to the southern border.",
      "Several of Trump's orders are likely to be subject to extensive legal battles. A coalition of over a dozen Democratic attorneys general sued Tuesday to block the birthright citizenship order, which critics have said violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.",
      "The Trump administration also\u00a0discontinued use of a government app, CBP One, used by migrants to submit their information and schedule appointments at southwest border ports of entry, according to\u00a0a statement posted on the Customs and Border Protection website. It is unclear if that change will be permanent.",
      "Tuesday's sermon was not the first time Budde, the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, has criticized Trump. In June 2020, she wrote an op-ed for The New York Times criticizing the then-president for clearing Lafayette Square, near the White House, amid the George Floyd protests and then posing for photos on the grounds of nearby St. John's Church while holding a Bible.",
      "\"The God I serve is on the side of justice. Jesus calls his followers to emulate his example of sacrificial love and to build what he called the Kingdom of God on earth,\" she wrote in the op-ed. \"What would the sacrificial love of Jesus look like now?\""

      "Ramaswamy, who signed on as a co-chair of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, shortly after Trump\u2019s victory in November, announced Monday that he will be leaving to launch a bid for governor in Ohio.",
      "\u201cMy sense is that things are very much touch and go,\u201d said Fishback, the CEO of the investment firm Azoria and a Ramaswamy confidant. \u201cI have tremendous respect for Vivek. And I have tremendous respect for the DOGE agenda. And I am willing to step up if that is something they still want to do.\u201d",
      "Ramaswamy, who built a plank in his presidential bid around deregulation and finding new ways to slash the federal workforce, had been expected to focus his attention on those issues. His co-chair, tech billionaire Elon Musk, would focus his time on finding ways to dramatically cut government spending. (Musk has revised down his predictions for just how much the outside agency will be able to successfully cut down.)",
      "\u201cThe regulatory piece is really important,\u201d Fishback said. \u201cThe anti-growth bureaucracy is holding back American prosperity and I would be honored to play a role in reviving this. I\u2019m willing to serve the country and then work with President Trump to deliver on this agenda. It\u2019s his agenda.\u201d",
      "A DOGE spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

      "Ichiro Suzuki, the dominant contact hitter whose 19 years in the major leagues, most of them with the Seattle Mariners, were lined with records and accolades, on Tuesday became the first Asian player elected to baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame.",
      "He received 99.7% of the vote, missing a unanimous selection by one vote. New York Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, inducted in 2019, remains the only member of the Hall of Fame to get 100%.",
      "Ichiro joins starting pitcher CC Sabathia and relief pitcher Billy Wagner as part of the class of 2025 headed to Cooperstown, New York.",
      "Yoshimasa Hayashi, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, congratulated Ichiro on Wednesday, telling reporters in Tokyo that he was \u201ca superstar who has given hope and dreams to many people.\u201d",
      "Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player to join Major League Baseball. That season he won both the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards.",
      "He went on to be a 10-time All Star and earned 10 Gold Glove awards for exceptional defense, as well as three Silver Slugger awards for his elite batting. Ichiro earned a reputation as an exceptional leadoff hitter (with a .311 career batting average) and as a formidable right fielder who, even at 5-foot-9, was known to scale outfield walls to rob home runs.",
      "Ichiro racked up 3,089 hits in MLB after having already played nine years in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball league. Combining his hits from both leagues, he had 4,367 hits across his professional career, the most of any player in baseball history.",
      "Ichiro told NBC News in a 2022 interview that he endured his share of challenges after he arrived in Seattle and that he was intensely aware of how American fans would perceive him. While he said he didn\u2019t set out to \u201cperform for Asians,\u201d he knew his performance would be scrutinized if he didn\u2019t deliver.",
      "\u201cAs a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there, and that\u2019s what I had to carry.\u201d",

      "Early on, fans would heckle him with jeers like \u201cGo back to Japan,\u201d Ichiro recalled, describing the interactions as \u201cthe norm\u201d for him at the time. But he quickly chipped away at those who sought to doubt or dismiss him, hitting a home run in his first road game. In 2019, he retired with the Mariners, playing his final game at the Tokyo Dome against the Oakland Athletics.",
      "Ichiro was also voted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame this month, getting 323 out of 349 votes in his first year of eligibility. In 2022, he was the first Asian player to be inducted into the Seattle Mariners Hall of Fame."

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 17:51:11 GMT",
    "summary": "Keke Palmer says her new film with SZA continues a tradition of side-splitting Black comedies with an important message.",
    "story": [
      "Audiences first got a glimpse of the multihyphenate actor and entertainer Keke Palmer and the multiplatinum, Grammy-winning artist SZA together on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d in 2022. Now they are box office queens with their film \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d defying predictions to become the No. 1 comedy in the country, coming in second only to Disney\u2019s latest \u201cLion King\u201d offering, \u201cMufasa\u201d from Barry Jenkins, during the four-day MLK holiday weekend.",
      "Inviting comparisons to the 1995 classic buddy comedy, \u201cFriday,\u201d \u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d written by Syreeta Singleton, follows two best friends and roommates \u2014 Palmer\u2019s straitlaced Dreux and SZA\u2019s free-spirited Alyssa \u2014 as they race against the clock to raise their rent money or be kicked out on the sidewalk with all their belongings.",
      "Palmer, who produced the film with Issa Rae, told NBC News that she signed on to the film because \u201cit felt familiar to me \u2014 a story about two girls growing up in an L.A. neighborhood trying to figure out how to make rent, but with all the hijinks and also all the lessons they learned along the way. It reminded me of the kind of films that I watched growing up about friendship, usually starring two guys, though.\u201d",
      "Palmer said she jumped at the chance to act in and produce a movie that \u201ccentered women in a way that I love,\u201d while paying homage to other films in the genre like \u201cLet\u2019s Do It Again\u201d with Sidney Poitier and Bill Cosby, \u201cBad Boys\u201d with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith, and plenty of others.",
      "Taking on a role behind the camera for a feature film stretched Palmer, who was last seen on the big screen in \u201cNope,\u201d from writer and director Jordan Peele. \u201cI think the challenge was staying in it, because it took a long time to do,\u201d she explained.",
      "The process for \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d began as Palmer was co-hosting \u201cGood Morning America\u2019s\u201d third hour, in 2019 and 2020. In the meantime, the actor, Emmy-winning \u201cPassword\u201d host, podcaster and author had to keep focused on her role as Dreux. She said she had to avoid \u201cletting myself get lost with all the different kinds of hoops you have to go through when you\u2019re putting a project together and wanting to get it right for the story you\u2019re telling but also wanting to make sure that the studio is happy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a great lesson in collaboration.\u201d",
      "As funny as this film is, with comedians Katt Williams, Janelle James, Lil Rel Howery and Gabrielle Dennis lending their talents, Lawrence Lamont\u2019s directorial debut delivers more than laughs. Instead, \u201cOne of Them Days\u201d uses humor to shed light on much bigger issues.",
      "\u201cEverybody\u2019s broke right now. The economy is struggling,\u201d said Rae, who is best known for her HBO series \u201cInsecure.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of our hustle culture, how hard it is to make ends meet, and also finding ways to laugh at the pain.\u201d",
      "Social commentary is an element Palmer insists people often miss in \u201cFriday,\u201d which is one of their film\u2019s main inspirations. \u201cWe\u2019re like \u2018Oh, \u201cFriday\u2019 is so funny,\u2019 but at the core of it, it was about gun violence,\u201d she noted. \u201cIt was about \u2018stop killing each other and shooting each other; if you want to fight, duke it out in the street, put the guns down.\u2019 It was about real messages.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith this movie, it was the same thing,\u201d she added. \u201c\u2019Yeah O.K., we got friendship during hijinks and people are crazy, but it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait a minute, there is a cycle of poverty here and actually it is really hard to work your way up, credit is a motherf----er, oh s---, I actually don\u2019t know how to pay back these student loans, oh wait a minute, gentrification, my city is edging me out \u2014 how do I maintain when I\u2019m in this cycle that I can\u2019t get out of?\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days\u201d also reaches back to Black film history beyond \u201cFriday,\u201d Palmer said. The music, she said, may remind viewers a bit of Blaxploitation era films, playing with satire while also speaking to the issues that are going on in the community.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne of Them Days,\u201d she said, addresses today\u2019s hard-hitting issues of gentrification, systemic racism and predatory lending while evoking\u00a0\u201chope, pride and understanding.\u201d"

      "This article is part of\u00a0\u201cDealing the Dead,\u201d\u00a0a series investigating the use of unclaimed bodies for medical research.",
      "The president of the University of North Texas Health Science Center is stepping down, four months after an NBC News investigation uncovered that the center had failed to contact families before using their loved ones\u2019 corpses for medical research.",
      "In an announcement Monday, the University of North Texas System Board of Regents said it had accepted Sylvia Trent-Adams\u2019 resignation. The three-paragraph statement, which praised Trent-Adams\u2019 \u201cdedication, integrity, and respect,\u201d did not mention NBC News\u2019 reporting or include a reason for her departure.",
      "In an email responding to questions, Health Science Center spokesperson Andy North said Trent-Adams \"has indicated her reasons for this departure are personal.\" Trent-Adams didn't respond to a message requesting comment.",
      "In September, NBC News published the first installment of a yearlong investigation into the Fort Worth-based Health Science Center\u2019s practice of chopping up, studying and leasing out the bodies of the unclaimed dead \u2014 those whose family members often cannot be easily reached, or whose relatives cannot pay for cremation or burial.",
      "Over a five-year period, the center had received about 2,350 unclaimed bodies from Dallas and Tarrant counties and used many of them to train medical students; others it dissected and leased to outside groups, including major biotech companies and the U.S. Army, helping bring in about $2.5 million a year to the center. This was done without consent from the dead and, in many cases, without the knowledge of any of their survivors.",
      "Just days before NBC News\u2019 investigation was published, after reporters had shared detailed findings, the Health Science Center announced it was suspending its body donation program, firing the officials who ran it and hiring a consulting firm to study the program\u2019s operations.",
      "In emails to students and faculty, Trent-Adams said the reporting had revealed \u201ca lack of sufficient controls and oversight\u201d of the center\u2019s Willed Body Program, which she said had \u201cfallen short of the standards of respect, care and professionalism that we demand.\u201d She said center leadership had been unaware, for example, that the body program was routinely shipping unclaimed remains \u2014 including those of U.S. military veterans \u2014 across state lines.",
      "In the days that followed, Trent-Adams fielded several messages from concerned students, staff and alumni, according to emails obtained through a public records request. In one message, a Health Science Center medical student wrote that they\u2019d been taught that \u201cconsent is at the forefront of the practice of medicine,\u201d but that NBC News\u2019 reporting had \u201ccalled into question whether the administration was practicing this in our academic anatomy lab.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt makes me sick to my stomach to think that we dissected bodies without consent,\u201d another student wrote to Trent-Adams. \u201cWe referred to them as \u2018donors\u2019 because that is what we thought they were, not indigent individuals who had no say in the matter.\u201d",
      "Many of those whose bodies were used by the Health Science Center were described as having no next of kin, but NBC News was able to quickly locate several families who were angry and heartbroken to learn from reporters that their relatives had been dissected and studied without permission. In October, the news outlet published the names of hundreds of people whose unclaimed bodies were sent to the center, leading more survivors to come forward. In total, reporters have identified more than 25 families who learned weeks, months or years later that a relative was used for research.",
      "As additional survivors came forward, the Health Science Center said in a statement in September that officials were \u201cworking to connect with families to extend our deepest apologies.\u201d",
      "Abigail Willson was among those seeking answers. She learned of her mother\u2019s death and donation to the Health Science Center from the list published by NBC News. When Willson and her family went to the center in October to request more information, she said a staff member told them Trent-Adams wished to meet with them.",
      "\u201cWe sat there for 45 minutes, and the president of the university never came,\u201d Willson said. \u201cThen they took our information to give to her, and she never called.\u201d",
      "The fallout continued in November when the Texas Funeral Service Commission sent a letter to Trent-Adams ordering the center to immediately halt the practice of liquefying bodies, which the commission said was prohibited under state law. The center defended the legality of the practice commonly known as water cremation, but said it had stopped doing it on the day NBC News published its investigation in September.",
      "The Health Science Center had been receiving unclaimed bodies since at least 2019, three years before Trent-Adams was hired as president following a career in the military. She previously served as acting U.S. surgeon general during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Her last day at the Health Science Center will be Jan. 31."

      "The creation of billions of dollars of digital wealth for the Trump Organization started with a social media post Friday.",
      "At 9:44 p.m. ET, the then-president-elect announced the creation of a new digital token: $TRUMP.",
      "\u201cMy NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It\u2019s time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING!\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s X account posted. \u201cJoin my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to http://gettrumpmemes.com \u2014 Have Fun!\u201d",
      "The announcement came with little fanfare. But what would ensue in the coming days \u2014 including wild price swings and Melania Trump\u2019s own digital token \u2014 would roil the crypto community, including some Trump supporters, just as he was set to return to the Oval Office.",
      "The $TRUMP and $MELANIA tokens, as they\u2019re referred to on social media, belong to the crypto category known as memecoins \u2014 digital assets that use blockchain technology similar to bitcoin.",
      "Because there is no asset like underlying cash flows backing memecoins like $TRUMP and $MELANIA, anyone who owns them will only make money if they sell them at a higher price than at which they bought them.",
      "That includes the coin creators \u2014\u00a0and Trump and his family \u2014\u00a0themselves.",
      "Though long a part of the crypto universe, memecoins have in recent months enjoyed a resurgence after Trump emerged victorious in November and promised to embrace blockchain technology and crypto markets.",
      "In the case of $TRUMP and $MELANIA, the coins were launched on Solana, a blockchain that collects fees to process transactions and is known for faster throughput, meaning it is less prone to seizing up when transaction volumes are high. It is not clear who knew about their launch before it occurred aside from the coins\u2019 developers and the Trump Organization.",
      "The slew of recent memecoin launches have triggered fresh skepticism and warnings about scams due to the freewheeling nature of memecoins. Because they are not formal investment vehicles, they are almost entirely unregulated, and anybody can start one under any name at any time, often for free. Platforms like CoinMarketCap that track digital tokens showed dozens of duplicate TRUMP coins.",
      "Bloomberg News summarized memecoin sales as \u201cthe crystallization of \u2018greater fool\u2019 investing, of an asset that\u2019s only worth what someone else is willing to pay for it at a given moment in time.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not sure people quite grasp how much of the crypto world is reacting to the Trump memecoin launches,\u201d Molly White, a software engineer and cryptocurrency chronicler, posted on X alongside screenshots from reactions that ranged from frustration to anger.",
      "White later told NBC News that the launch of the coins seemed to dash hopes from some that Trump would help further legitimize the crypto industry.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s now a fear that people who are not super familiar with this industry will see it as a cash grab and not see all the good uses of crypto that exist,\u201d she said. \u201cThey worry this will give crypto a bad name.\u201d",
      "Part of that frustration centered on Trump\u2019s recent emergence as a champion for all things crypto. During his 2024 presidential campaign, Trump made clear his support for crypto, speaking at the annual Bitcoin Conference and pledging to consider creating a \u201cstrategic bitcoin reserve\u201d that would see the U.S. purchase billions' worth of the cryptocurrency in a bid to encourage price support and adoption. Trump has also launched a line of NFTs, and his family launched a crypto banking platform last year.",
      "And Trump\u2019s memecoin looked poised to be a major success, at least at first. The price of $TRUMP took off almost immediately, and by Saturday morning a single coin was trading at $75 \u2014 a 650% rise, at least, from its Friday launch price. Crypto enthusiasts who track transactions \u2014 many blockchains, including the one used by $TRUMP, are public-facing \u2014 reported some holders who had bought in early holding millions of dollars' worth of the token.",
      "A Trump transition team spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The $TRUMP surge suddenly reversed when another coin came on the scene \u2014 from Trump\u2019s own spouse.",
      "On Sunday afternoon, Melania Trump\u2019s X account posted that her $MELANIA memecoin was live. Donald Trump\u2019s X account reposted that message.",
      "The price of $TRUMP immediately plunged upon $MELANIA\u2019s appearance, with some suggesting demand for one would eat into interest in the other.",
      "\u201c$MELANIA coin is being viewed as a competitor against $TRUMP coin,\u201d market commentary group The Kobeissi Letter wrote on X. \u201cThis has resulted in a sharp drop in demand for $TRUMP.\u201d",
      "Later Sunday, a $BARRON coin also started to trade, further adding to the market concerns. However, $BARRON\u2019s connection, if any, to Trump\u2019s youngest son, Barron, or the Trump family was not clear. No official Trump social media accounts have posted about it.",
      "As the price of $TRUMP began falling, backlash ensued.",
      "\u201cDear @realDonaldTrump : Please fire whoever recommended going forward with the Melania launch today,\u201d Ryan Selkis, a longtime crypto advocate and political conservative, wrote on X on Sunday as the price of $TRUMP began to fall. \u201c1. They don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. 2. They cost you a lot of $ and goodwill. 3. They don\u2019t have your interests in mind.\u201d",
      "By Tuesday, the price of $TRUMP had not recovered from the decline. Still, shortly after Trump\u2019s swearing-in, the combined holdings among the Trump- and Melania-related corporations that launched the coins were worth tens of billions, at least on paper, according to crypto news website CoinDesk \u2014\u00a0and possibly worth more.",
      "Because all holders\u2019 wallets, including those of Trump and the coin\u2019s creators, are visible on the blockchain, any transactions they\u2019re involved in will be closely watched. And a large sell-off from those wallets would likely trigger a major price fall, according to Ari Redbord, head of legal and government affairs at TRM Labs, a firm that monitors crypto projects.",
      "But Redbord said Trump\u2019s celebrity adds a factor that\u2019s worth watching.",
      "\u201cObviously Trump, because of who he is, elevates a memecoin launch like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has released a voluntary ethics document designed to limit private financial interests from shaping his official policy agenda.",
      "But the president\u2019s involvement in the crypto project also raises questions over potential use by illicit actors or foreign governments, Redbord said.",
      "Consumers need to realize that there are \u201cfar fewer\u201d protections with memecoins than traditional stocks, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s highly volatile,\" Redbord added, saying \"consumers really need to understand what they\u2019re investing in, because you\u2019re going to lose big and you could potentially win big.\u201d",
      "Mark Cuban, a technology investor and ardent Trump critic who has also been involved in crypto, warned on X that the Trumps\u2019 direct foray into the industry would usher in a new era of fraudulent activity, with unsavvy investors the victims.",
      "\u201cHello every scam targeted at everyone and anyone who has no clue about crypto,\u201d Cuban said on X on Monday about the coins. \u201cGood bye whatever hope the crypto industry had of legitimizing itself.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order Monday that gives TikTok a 75-day extension during which the United States will not enforce the law meant to force the app's owner to sell the company.",
      "The law, which President Joe Biden signed in April, requires TikTok\u2019s owner, the Chinese company ByteDance, to sell most of its stake for TikTok to continue to operate in the United States.\u00a0It went into effect Sunday, but the Biden administration said it wouldn't enforce the law. Now, Trump is continuing that approach.",
      "\"I hereby order the Attorney General not to take any action on behalf of the United States to enforce the Act for 75 days from the date of this order, to permit my Administration an opportunity to determine the appropriate course of action with respect to TikTok,\" the White House said in the order. \"During this period, the Department of Justice shall take no action to enforce the Act or impose any penalties against any entity for any noncompliance with the Act, including for distributing, maintaining, or updating (or enabling the distribution, maintenance, or updating) of any foreign adversary controlled application as defined in the Act.\"",
      "The order temporarily halts the recent back-and-forth surrounding the app's accessibility. After the Supreme Court upheld the law behind the looming ban Friday, TikTok voluntarily made itself unavailable to U.S. customers Saturday evening. On Sunday, after Trump said he preferred the app to stay operable to help broadcast his inauguration, TikTok resumed service, greeting American users with a message that thanked him.",
      "TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The order also specifically directs the Justice Department not to take action against any U.S. company for helping TikTok get back online on Sunday. Those companies will also receive a letter from the attorney general saying that they did not violate any law and that they face no legal liability.",
      "Apple and Google didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment. TikTok is not currently available in either company's app store.",
      "Biden and the bipartisan members of Congress who passed the law warned that ByteDance\u2019s close ties with the Chinese government made TikTok both a propaganda threat and a possible avenue for Beijing\u2019s spies to track Americans.",
      "The extension does not overturn the law \u2014 the president has no such authority. TikTok still must either find a U.S. company to take an 80% stake in it or it will be banned under the law.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that he wanted to find a deal for TikTok that involved ownership split 50-50 between ByteDance and the United States, though it is unclear whether Trump meant a U.S. company and whether that deal would survive court challenges based on the law\u2019s requirements.",
      "Some investors and companies have said they are interested in acquiring the necessary stake in TikTok to keep it active in the United States, but China had given no indication that it would be open to a sale \u2014 at least until very recently.",
      "On Monday, Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Affairs Ministry, indicated a willingness to allow ByteDance to sell at least part of the company, rather than the country\u2019s banning such a deal.",
      "\u201cAs for business operations and acquisitions, we firmly believe that these should be decided according to market principles and left to the discretion of the companies. If Chinese companies are involved, they should comply with China\u2019s laws and regulations,\u201d Mao said."

      "The Walt Disney Company\u2019s\u00a0box office domination continued over the holiday weekend.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d topped $1 billion during the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, becoming the studio\u2019s third 2024 release to reach the coveted benchmark after Marvel Studios\u2019 \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine\u201d and Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2.\u201d No other Hollywood studio had a film cross $1 billion last year.",
      "\u201cMoana 2\u201d snared $442.8 million at the domestic box office and $567.1 million in international markets, the company posted over the weekend. It is the fourth film from the Walt Disney Animation arm to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales alongside \u201cFrozen,\u201d \u201cFrozen II\u201d and \u201cZootopia.\u201d",
      "This feat is another feather in the cap for Disney, which had struggled in the years after the pandemic to gain tractions with its animated releases. Much of the company\u2019s difficulties stemmed, in part, from decisions to debut a handful of animated features directly on its streaming service Disney+. This trained parents to look for new content at home even after theatrical closures ended and films returned to cinemas.",
      "\u201cInside Out 2\u201d not only marked a return to form for Disney, but it helped jumpstart the overall domestic box office in June.

      "With \u201cMoana 2\u201d crossing the billion-dollar mark, Disney now has 32 billion-dollar movies \u2014 including three films it acquired when it bought Fox in 2019, according to the company.

      "Four men from Chile have been charged in an ongoing investigation of nationwide burglaries at the homes of the rich and sometimes famous, according to court documents.",
      "The four have been linked to a Dec. 9 burglary in Hamilton County, Ohio, authorities say in the filing, a time and place that coincide with a break-in at the home of Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow. Though the documents did not name Burrow as a victim, a Bengals hat allegedly stolen during that December break-in was spotted by detectives in an SUV used by the suspects, the documents say.",
      "Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost announced that a grand jury returned an indictment against the four in court Tuesday. It includes charges of corrupt activity, participation in a criminal gang and possessing burglary tools, according to a statement. He credited the Southwest Ohio Burglary Task Force, which his office launched last year to investigate the break-ins.",
      "A spokesperson for Yost said the indictment was returned at a preliminary hearing at which the defendants did not enter pleas. Ohio criminal procedure does not require pleas to be entered for felony cases at such hearings.",
      "The original criminal complaint includes those charges, as well as obstructing investigators, according to the local case filed in Springfield municipal court on Jan. 13. Authorities alleged in the filing that three of the four presented fake identification to police.",
      "Investigators say an LSU football shirt believed to have been taken in the Dec. 9 burglary was also spotted in the Chevrolet SUV after Ohio State Police stopped it on Interstate 70 on Jan. 10 during an investigation of the burglaries, according to the initial filings. Burrow graduated from Louisiana State University, where he played his final two seasons of college football.",
      "A cellphone one of the four, Bastian Alejandro Morales, 23, was alleged to possess was determined to have been in the area of the Dec. 9 home burglary, and he was previously spotted in a Volkswagen SUV seen in the area of the burglary, investigators said in the Jan. 13 court documents.",
      "Burrow's home in Anderson Township had been ransacked on that date, the Hamilton County Sheriff's Office reported. At the time, Burrow was in Arlington, Texas, where he played in his team's win against the Dallas Cowboys.",
      "Burrow's agent and the Bengals did not immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday night.",

      "Since the start of 2024, athletes who have been victimized by residential break-ins include Burrow, Kansas City Chiefs stars Travis Kelce and Patrick Mahomes, Milwaukee Bucks forward Bobby Portis Jr., Dallas Mavericks guard Luka Don\u010di\u0107 and the fianc\u00e9e of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.",
      "The stars' locations are often matters of public record, with even publicized home games indicating they're not really at home.",

The documents described all of them as Chileans who were alleged to have \"overstayed their permissions.\"",
      "They were initially detained for being in the country illegally, authorities said in the documents. All were in custody with no bail listed Tuesday evening, according to inmate records. All four have pleaded not guilty to the initial charges, court records show.",
      "It is not clear whether they have retained counsel. The public defender's office in Clark County did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Todd Spitzer, the district attorney in Orange County, California, has blamed some of the crimes committed by Chileans on U.S. soil on the automated Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), which clears visitors for 90-day passes under the Visa Waiver Program, granting citizens of 42 nations permission to enter and stay with relative ease.",
      "\u201cFor the last 18 months, I have been sounding the alarm about a dangerous loophole in the ESTA Visa Waiver program that is being exploited by organized crime rings from Chile to enter the United States unlimited times over a two-year period without background checks,\u201d Spitzer said last month.",
      "\"These criminals aren\u2019t coming to the United States to visit Disneyland,\" he said by email.",
      "Though investigators have not directly alleged the four Ohio defendants were involved in any of the nationwide burglaries that have victimized wealthy people, star athletes and some celebrities, the criminal complaint based on a narrative by Clark County Sheriff's Detective Brian Melchi said the suspects were targeted as part of \u201can ongoing investigation involving burglaries of multi-million dollar homes in multiple states.\"",
      "The Ohio State Highway Patrol traffic stop of the SUV carrying the defendants on Jan. 10 took place after they had stayed in a hotel in Fairfield, according to the criminal complaint, which made it clear they had been under surveillance.",
      "Inside the SUV, investigators said in court documents, was the smell of marijuana, as well as two Husky tools used to punch windows often found in the possession of South American burglars.",
      "The cellphone alleged to have been in Morales' possession and linked to the area of the Dec. 9 burglary came to the attention of investigators searching the Chevrolet Blazer when one of the detectives called a \"target\" number known to the investigation and the device alleged to belong to Morales lit up, according to the complaint.",
      "\"Investigators have arrested at least six different South American burglary groups, five of which were Chilean,\" the filing says.",

      "With the stroke of a pen, Trump issued pardons to roughly 1,500 criminal defendants and commuted the sentences of 14 others in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. He also ordered the dismissals of hundreds of cases that were still being prosecuted.",

      "What Trump is saying: He defended the Jan. 6 pardons during a news conference Tuesday, Katherine Doyle reports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve served years in jail,\u201d Trump said in response to questions from reporters at the White House on why he pardoned violent offenders. \u201cThey should not have served, and they\u2019ve served years in jail. And murderers don\u2019t even go to jail in this country.\u201d",
      "What current and former prosecutors are saying: People in the Justice Department and legal scholars are calling the move an unprecedented and dangerous use of the pardon power that dealt a crushing blow not just to federal law enforcement, but to the U.S. justice system, as Ken Dilanian and Ryan J.

      "What to know from Day 2 of the Trump presidency",
      "Beyond the fallout from the Jan. 6 pardons, Day 2 of Trump\u2019s tenure again brought a flurry of news. Here are the top lines:",
      "Trump announced a joint venture with OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank to invest billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States.Trump met with congressional Republicans at the White House, where they discussed their legislative strategy and the possibility of using recess appointments to confirm Cabinet nominees.\u00a0Democratic attorneys general filed lawsuits seeking to block Trump\u2019s attempt to revoke the right to automatic birthright citizenship.

      "The bishop leading the inaugural prayer service Tuesday urged Trump to \u201chave mercy\u201d on his constituents, specifically naming LGBTQ people and immigrants.",
      "Vance takes on a unique role as a second-term VP",
      "When he was sworn in Monday, JD Vance instantly assumed a unique perch on the political stage: as the vice president to a term-limited president.",
      "Rather than waiting eight years (and spending the next four promoting his boss\u2019 re-election efforts), Vance enters office with the 2028 Republican presidential nomination wide open. It\u2019s a position that six previous vice presidents have enjoyed since the enactment of the 22nd Amendment, which capped presidential service at two terms.",
      "All but one of those six nursed presidential ambitions of their own, though only three actually managed to secure their party\u2019s next nomination \u2014 with just one, George H.W. Bush in 1988, winning the presidency.",
      "The two most recent VPs in Vance\u2019s position both declined to run. In Dick Cheney\u2019s case, there was no drama; he forswore any presidential ambitions in exchange for an enormously influential role in George W. Bush\u2019s administration. In 2016, Joe Biden made his desire to run clear but relented in the face of some unsubtle discouragement from Barack Obama and other Democratic leaders.",
      "And way back in 1952, Alben Barkley, who\u2019d been picked as Harry Truman\u2019s running mate in 1948 (three years after Truman had assumed office), angled for the Democratic nomination at a time when convention deal-making \u2014 and not the primary process \u2014 was decisive. But concerns about his age, 74, led delegates to look elsewhere.",
      "The three vice presidents other on the list came to office with obvious ambitions. Both Richard Nixon in 1960 and Al Gore in 2000 had served in popular administrations and enjoyed strong relationships with party leaders, who helped to clear the way for them. George H.W. Bush in 1988 was also part of a popular administration, but while he was ultimately successful, his path to the GOP nomination was trickier. He had run against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 primaries and spent his vice presidency trying to persuade skeptical conservatives that he was no longer the moderate he\u2019d positioned himself as in that campaign.",
      "There\u2019s no reason to believe Vance isn\u2019t also interested in becoming his party\u2019s next standard-bearer. And he starts off in a seemingly solid position. He is a skillful communicator, and his performance during the campaign was well-received within the GOP. More important, he\u2019s a Trump loyalist with personal ties to the president\u2019s sons. And Trump himself seems to have a fondness for Vance that he never expressed toward Mike Pence, his previous VP.",
      "Given the unparalleled sway Trump holds with Republicans, a seamless, Trump-blessed elevation of Vance to the top of the 2028 GOP ticket is conceivable. Also conceivable: that at some point in the next four years, Vance will look up and find his path irrevocably blocked by a shift in Trump\u2019s view of him.",

    "published": "Tue, 21 Jan 2025 23:44:05 GMT",
    "summary": "On the first anniversary of the Jan. 6 riot, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland tried to convey the enormous scope of the law enforcement effort to bring the rioters to justice, calling it \u201cone of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "On the first anniversary of the\u00a0Jan. 6 riot, then-Attorney General Merrick Garland tried to convey the enormous scope of the law enforcement effort to bring the rioters to justice, calling it \u201cone of the largest, most complex and most resource-intensive investigations in our history.\u201d",
      "With the\u00a0stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump turned that effort to dust Monday with a blanket pardon of virtually every federal Jan. 6 defendant, save a few who still got their prison terms commuted.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s OK,\u201d Jason Manning, who spent years as a line prosecutor working on Jan. 6\u00a0cases in Washington, told NBC News in an exclusive interview.\u00a0\u201cI find the pardons appalling.\u201d",
      "People in the\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0and legal scholars\u00a0are calling the move an unprecedented and dangerous use of the pardon power that dealt a crushing blow not just to federal law enforcement, but also to the U.S. justice system. They say it\u00a0makes a mockery of years of work by FBI agents, prosecutors and federal judges, some of whom Trump appointed,\u00a0after an effort that included charges against 1,583 defendants, more than 1,000 guilty pleas and more than 200 convictions at trial. Some worry it signals open season for political violence \u2014\u00a0given that 608 of those charged were accused of assaulting, resisting or impeding law enforcement agents or officers \u2014\u00a0while others fret about the marker laid down for future presidents.",
      "Manning said the pardons were an affront to the many police officers who were seriously injured that day.",
      "\u201cHave to think about what it means for those officers and their loved ones to receive this message that those assaults don\u2019t matter, that attacking police officers like that is OK,\u201d he said.",
      "When Manning joined the effort to prosecute Jan. 6 offenders, he said, he thought of it in terms of protecting democracy. But after spending time with police officers who responded to the riot, \"once I got a sense of what hell they lived through and how much they put up with to try to stand ground for this country, the cases really became about so much about vindicating them as victims,\" he continued.",
      "Trump said in his order granting the pardons that the sweeping move\u00a0\u201cends a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years\u00a0and begins a process of national reconciliation.\u201d",
      "Overall, Trump pardoned roughly 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants, including those convicted of brutal assaults on police. Only 14 riot organizers were not pardoned, but they still received commutations of\u00a0lengthy prison sentences. Trump\u00a0also ordered the dismissal of hundreds of cases that were still being prosecuted.",
      "Alberto Gonzales, who was attorney general in President George W. Bush\u2019s administration, told NBC News he would have urged Trump not to pardon violent offenders.",
      "\u201cObviously anyone involved in a violent crime to me it\u2019s somewhat disappointing that they would get a full pardon,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you assault a police officer, that\u2019s a very serious crime, and there ought to be some serious jail time associated with it. I don\u2019t know how you can argue it\u2019s a witch hunt when the prosecutions were successful.\u201d",
      "Gonzales, the dean of the Belmont University School of Law, also lamented the waste of resources.",
      "\u201cThe department spent a lot of time and money prosecuting these cases. All that is for naught.\u00a0Talk about government waste, right?\u201d\u00a0he said.",
      "Inside the Justice Department, officials were still coming to grips with a presidential action that hit like a lightning bolt.\u00a0Nearly everyone expected some\u00a0Jan. 6\u00a0pardons, but Trump\u2019s own vice president and nominee for attorney general said in recent days that people convicted of attacking law enforcement officials should not be treated favorably.\u00a0Many Republican members of Congress \u2014 who faced danger during the attack \u2014 have said the same.",
      "A senior career official\u00a0at the Justice Department\u00a0called the blanket pardons a \u201cterrible injustice,\u201d while another said it \u201csignals a very strong green light to political violence\u201d\u00a0that \u201csignals basically nothing that happened on Jan. 6 was wrong.\u00a0It\u2019s what I see as the campaign of personal retribution\u201d on Trump's part.",
      "The first official said he was even more concerned about the\u00a0appointment of Ed Martin,\u00a0who has been a prominent\u00a0backer of Jan. 6 defendants, as interim U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C.",
      "\u201cThat could really drive people out,\u201d\u00a0the first official\u00a0said. \u201cThe pardons are terrible. But if it were limited to pardons with no long-standing assertion of control, that would be bad \u2014 but not fundamentally counter to how the U.S. attorney\u2019s office would operate going forward. We\u2019ve seen very controversial pardons over the years. ... This is extreme in not only the pardons, but prospectively.\u201d",
      "Mike Davis, a lawyer who advises Trump informally on law enforcement issues, defended pardoning even\u00a0those who committed violence.\u00a0He told NBC News the Biden administration \u201cpersecuted\u201d Jan. 6 defendants by labeling them insurrectionists and treated them differently from others who committed similar crimes.",
      "He did not oppose criminal charges against those who attacked police officers,\u00a0Davis\u00a0said, but even those people \u201chave suffered enough for the last four years.\u00a0They\u2019ve already paid more of a price than any [Black Lives Matter] protester who attacked police.\u201d",
      "Even violent rioters who had not yet been prosecuted, he said, have paid a high price.",
      "Among some legal experts and\u00a0lawyers who have represented Jan. 6 defendants, there was a narrower argument to justify pardons of at least the nonviolent\u00a0offenders:\u00a0that\u00a0the Justice Department was unusually and unfairly tough on them.",
      "\u201cThe resources expended by the FBI and DOJ to prosecute the average J6er was insane,\u201d said a lawyer who declined to be named because he regularly\u00a0deals with the Justice Department. \u201cParticularly given that DOJ has done blanket dismissals for lots of crazy vandalism/violence in other contexts\u00a0or just prosecuted ringleaders.\u201d",
      "There were\u00a0stories of members of the mob who did nothing more than enter the Capitol\u00a0illegally, pleaded guilty to felonies and spent time in jail \u2014 in many cases a life-shattering development.",
      "Paul H. Robinson, the Colin S. Diver professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, argued in an interview that authorities did not devote similar resources and intensity to people who engaged in violence during summer 2020 riots in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.\u00a0Many Republican politicians have also made that argument.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to look at the situation and not to say there is a large component of politics here,\u201d\u00a0Robinson\u00a0said. \u201cThere really was, I think, sort of an overeagerness in the Justice Department to make this into something that it wasn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Justice Department officials disagree, arguing that the attack on the Capitol was different from other riots because it was an attempt to impede the lawful transfer of power\u00a0that happened\u00a0in plain sight,\u00a0with\u00a0an unprecedented amount of video evidence.",
      "But even many skeptics agree with prosecutors on this much: Trump went too far when he pardoned people who engaged in violence.",
      "\u201cThe guys with real violence, real planning, weapons, etc. \u2014 those pardons are ugly and bad,\u201d\u00a0said the lawyer who regularly deals with the Justice Department. \u201cI guess they just didn\u2019t want the headache of separating the sheep from the goats,\u00a0so they went blanket.\u201d",
      "Robinson, in an op-ed published Monday morning in The Hill newspaper, urged Trump to act with restraint\u00a0on Jan. 6\u00a0pardons. He told NBC News: \u201cObviously he didn\u2019t listen to me. It\u2019s not good for the country, and it\u2019s not good for the president.\u201d",
      "Randall Eliason, a former federal prosecutor and a professor at George Washington University Law School, said\u00a0he saw\u00a0the pardons as \u201ca terrible blow to the justice system, and I would argue it\u2019s one of Trump\u2019s most dangerous abuses of power to date. The signal that it sends is that if you commit crimes on Trump\u2019s behalf, he will have your back and make sure you are not held accountable.\u201d",
      "Bruce Ackerman, the Sterling professor of law and political science at Yale Law School,\u00a0called it\u00a0\u201ca situation of not a thoughtful and discerning use of presidential pardon power but a president pardoning his allies for their participation in a violent coup d\u2019etat.\u201d",
      "Some legal scholars, including Ackerman, said former President Joe\u00a0Biden\u2019s\u00a0last-minute\u00a0pre-emptive pardons of family members were also an abuse of the pardon power.",
      "But\u00a0Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and an NBC News contributor\u00a0who\u00a0agreed that some of Biden\u2019s pardons were deeply problematic, said, \u201cThe whataboutism doesn\u2019t work here.\u201d He added:\u00a0\u201cPardons are most appropriate for people who have paid their debt to society, have shown contrition and remorse, have accepted responsibility and who have earned grace. None of that seems to have been part of Trump\u2019s equation.\u201d",
      "Trump and allies have long waged a campaign of disinformation about Jan. 6, asserting that antifa or FBI operatives ginned up the riot or that the descriptions of violence were overblown.\u00a0Trump repeatedly called the Jan. 6 defendants \u201chostages.\u201d",
      "In addition to the\u00a0video evidence documenting\u00a0the violence, independent investigations debunked the conspiracy theories, including one by the Justice Department inspector general that found no evidence that anyone linked to the FBI did anything to incite the riot.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan, pointedly took on the fabrications in a sentencing opinion a year ago, writing: \u201cIn my thirty-seven years on the bench, I cannot recall a time when such meritless justifications of criminal activity have gone mainstream.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Court fears,\u201d\u00a0Lamberth continues, \u201cthat such destructive, misguided rhetoric could presage further danger to our country.\u201d",
      "Manning, the\u00a0former\u00a0prosecutor\u00a0of Jan. 6 cases, said that while the pardons are painful, they do not \u201cchange the fact that these crimes were committed\u201d or that the Justice Department won more than 1,000 convictions.",
      "\u201cSo speaking just for myself, no regrets about the effort we made to build these cases, and even after these pardons, the record stands,\u201d he said."

      "After he won the presidential election, Donald Trump told Time magazine that he was still considering pardoning his supporters who were involved in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol but that he was particularly eyeing those who were charged with \u201cnon-violent\u201d crimes.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to do case-by-case, and if they were non-violent, I think they\u2019ve been greatly punished,\u201d he said.",
      "Instead, on his first day in office, Trump went far broader, issuing pardons for most of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6 attack. His actions have paved the way for the releases of numerous people found guilty of violent attacks.",
      "Here are some of them:",
      "Tyler Bradley Dykes",
      "Dykes, of Bluffton, South Carolina, was sentenced to 57 months in federal prison for stealing a police riot shield and twice using it against officers. He pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers.",
      "Prosecutors accused Dykes of giving a \u201cSieg Heil!\u201d (Hail to victory!) salute during the attack, which he denied. Prosecutors also said that Dykes quoted Adolf Hitler before the attack and that he had participated in a training for a neo-Nazi accelerationist group, The Base.",
      "When Dykes, who was discharged from the Marines for \u201cparticipating in extremist behavior,\u201d was taken into federal custody, he was serving a five-year sentence for his actions in the racist \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.",
      "Andrew Taake",
      "Taake, of Houston, was sentenced to a little more than six years for assaulting law enforcement officers with bear spray and a metal whip. On Dec. 20, 2023, he pleaded guilty to one count of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers using a dangerous weapon. A sting operation launched by a woman on the dating app Bumble after the Jan. 6 attack led to his arrest. Taake and other Jan. 6 participants gave up information to her about their activities during the attack, which she provided to investigators.",
      "Taake was on pretrial release on a charge of soliciting a minor at the time of the attack. He was among the first to breach the restricted perimeter of the Capitol grounds and swarm the West Plaza, prosecutors said.",
      "Christopher Quaglin",
      "Quaglin, who federal prosecutors said \u201cviciously assaulted numerous officers\u201d and was one of the most violent rioters, was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison.",
      "On July 10, 2023, he was found guilty of 14 charges: 12 felonies and two misdemeanors.",
      "\u201cOn at least a dozen occasions, Quaglin stood face-to-face with officers as he screamed at, pushed with outstretched arms, punched, swatted, and slapped officers; pushed bike racks into officers; and even choked one officer to the ground,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a sentencing memo.",
      "According to prosecutors, Quaglin said on social media that he traveled to Washington to fight in what he believed would be a \u201cCIVIL WAR!\u201d against a tyrannical government and that he intended to show the members of Congress who their bosses were.",
      "Quaglin, of North Brunswick, New Jersey, lashed out at the U.S. district judge who sentenced him, Trevor McFadden, whom Trump appointed in 2017.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re Trump\u2019s worst mistake of 2016,\u201d Quaglin told McFadden in a lengthy statement at his sentencing.",

      "Taylor James Johnatakis",
      "Johnatakis, of Kingston, Washington, was convicted of three felonies in November 2023: obstruction of an official proceeding, assaulting officers and civil disorder. Johnatakis represented himself at trial and indicated that did not think he was subject to the laws governing the United States.",
      "He was also convicted of four misdemeanors: entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds, disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds, engaging in physical violence in a restricted building or grounds and engaging in an act of physical violence in the grounds of any of the Capitol building. He was sentenced to seven years in federal prison.",
      "Prosecutors said that he\u00a0\u201ccoordinated a violent assault on a line of police officers defending\u201d the Capitol and that video shows he \u201cused a metal barricade to attack officers head on and grabbed one officer to prevent him from defending himself against other attacking rioters \u2014 contributing to that officer\u2019s physical injury.\u201d",
      "Before the attack, Johnatakis said on social media that he was going to Washington, D.C., \u201cto CHANGE the course of HISTORY #stopthesteal\u201d and \u201cWhat the British did to DC will be nothing...\u201d",
      "David Dempsey",
      "Dempsey, who, according to prosecutors, \u201cwas one of the most violent rioters,\u201d received one of the longest sentences: 20 years in prison. The FBI arrested him in August 2021. He traveled from his home in Santa Ana, California, to Washington with others and attended\u00a0the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally at the Ellipse on the morning of Jan. 6.",
      "Later that day, Dempsey said various Democratic politicians, including \u201cClinton,\u201d \u201cObama,\u201d Jerry Nadler and Nancy Pelosi, should be hanged and called them \u201cpieces of garbage\u201d and other expletives, prosecutors said.",
      "Dempsey walked with others toward the Capitol and made his way to the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, where some of the most violent attacks against law enforcement occurred, prosecutors said. He joined the crowd, pushing into a line of police officers defending the tunnel, prosecutors also said.",
      "Dempsey climbed over fellow rioters \u201clike human scaffolding\u201d and used \u201chis hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on\u201d as weapons against officers, according to prosecutors.",
      "Nearly three years later to the day, on Jan. 4, 2024, Dempsey pleaded guilty to two felony counts of assaulting, resisting or impeding officers with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Prosecutors said Dempsey had a \u201cvery significant history of arrests and convictions.\u201d He assaulted anti-Trump protesters with bear spray in 2019, which resulted in a two-year suspended sentence.

      "He would go on to attend Trump\u2019s rally at the Ellipse. On Jan. 6, after having joined the fight in the Capitol\u2019s Lower West Tunnel, Rodriguez attacked Fanone. He later bragged about his actions in the Telegram chat, writing: \u201cOmg I did so much f---ing s--- rn [right now] and got away,\u201d\u00a0and \u201cTazzed the f--- out of the blue.\u201d",

He acknowledged his actions against Fanone but did not apologize.",
      "Before he was sentenced, Fanone said, in part: \u201cAny compassion or empathy I felt toward those who laid siege to our Capitol, whose actions I felt were at least in part influenced by their leader, Donald Trump, and his lies, has been eroded \u2014 eroded by the attacks directed at me and my family by supporters of Donald Trump and the right-wing media.\u201d",

      "He pleaded guilty in November 2023 to one felony count each of obstruction of an official proceeding and assaulting officers performing their duties.",
      "He was sentenced to more than five years in prison. In a video\u00a0recorded before he took part in the attack, Nichols said the mob would lynch elected officials who voted to certify Joe Biden\u2019s presidential victory.",
      "\u201cRyan Nichols said it, if you voted for f---ing treason we\u2019re going to drag your f---ing a-- through the streets,\u201d he said in the video as he marched to the Capitol.",
      "After he was seen on video spraying a giant canister of a chemical weapon at officers inside the Lower West Terrace Tunnel, Nichols bragged about his conduct on Facebook and called for more violence.",
      "\u201cSo if you want to know where Ryan Nichols stands, Ryan Nichols stands for violence,\u201d\u00a0he said\u00a0in a video cited by prosecutors.",

      "At his sentencing, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said that while Nichols\u2019 apology at his sentencing hearing appeared to be sincere, he made \u201cvery rigorous comments\u201d on tape about his desire for future violence."

      "\u201cLove Is Blind\u201d Season 7 star Ashley Adionser announced that she and husband Tyler Francis have broken up.",
      "The Netflix reality stars met and got engaged during Season 7 of the popular reality dating series. They pair were fan-favorites until viewers, and Adionser seemingly, learned in Episode 9 that Francis had fathered three children. As the two resolved their issues in the following episodes and eventually tied the knot in the season finale, Francis\u2019 paternity controversy unfolded on social media, with the mother of his children sharing her side of the story.",
      "During the reunion, which aired Oct. 30, 2024, Adionser and Francis said they were still happily together and enjoying married life despite the obstacle. But on Monday, Jan. 21, Adionser confirmed in a statement to TODAY.com that she and Francis recently split.",
      "\u201cAfter much reflection, I want to share that Tyler and I have been separated for several weeks and have now made the difficult decision to end our marriage,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWhile I had hoped for mutual understanding and transparency in our relationship, it has become clear that our paths are no longer aligned, making it impossible for me to continue in this marriage.\u201d",
      "She continued, \u201cThis was not a decision I made lightly, but one I know is necessary for my own growth and peace. While this chapter is ending, I will always hold respect for the time and love we shared. I kindly ask for privacy during this deeply personal time as I focus on healing and building a new future. Thank you for your understanding and support.\u201d",
      "On the show, Adionser and Francis had an emotional conversation after it was revealed that he had fathered three children. In Episode 10, Francis explained to Adionser, \u201cI had a very close friend. Her and her wife wanted to have a baby. And they couldn\u2019t afford a sperm donor. I thought that was God telling me, you know, \u2018Help someone else.\u2019 And it felt good.\u201d",
      "When she asked if he knew what the children looked like, he replied, \u201cHmm, I don\u2019t think so.\u201d",
      "Before the finale and reunion aired, Bri Thomas, the mother of Francis\u2019 children, disputed some of his claims in a series of Instagram videos that have since been deleted.",
      "She claimed that she was \u201cco-parenting\u201d the three children with Francis before he left for filming and his relationship with them changed after he returned. She also said she and Francis were involved in legal proceedings regarding custody.",
      "TODAY.com obtained a Baltimore court case docket involving a January 2024 custody case between Thomas and Francis that was originally filed in 2021. TODAY.com contacted Thomas and Francis for comments at the time.",
      "During the Season 7 reunion, Adionser and Francis said they were still together after nearly a year of marriage. While addressing his past, he said, \u201cThose kids, that family, they did not sign up for this.\u201d",
      "He added that he \u201cvoluntarily stepped in and helped\u201d and that is why photos circulated on social media of him with the three children.",
      "\u201cI do want to let people know that Ashley knows all of this,\u201d Francis shared. \u201cI\u2019m good, we\u2019re good. I\u2019m not gonna keep harping on it.\u201d",
      "Adionser chimed in and said that it was \u201cinsulting\u201d to her intelligence that fans suggested Francis \u201cblindsided\u201d her on the show with the news that he had three children.",
      "She explained that he did not want to speak about the situation on camera, but she felt differently. \u201cI just didn\u2019t feel like it would be an authentic experience, or that I could continue the experience if we didn\u2019t,\u201d Adionser said.",
      "\u201c(I said) \u2018I do\u2019 to all of it,\u201d she told hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey. \u201cI was aware and I took on what I wanted to.\u201d",
      "Before the season aired, the former couple spoke to TODAY.com in separate interviews and gushed about their love story.",
      "\u201cIt was just a feeling that I\u2019ve never felt before in my life. From day one, it was Ashley. It was a feeling that I\u2019ve constantly kept feeling with her. It was just safe. It was warm. It felt like the most love I\u2019ve ever experienced,\u201d Francis said.",
      "Adionser acknowledged that she was skeptical during the process but felt that Francis was the right person for her.",
      "\u201cI think that I was just willing to take a risk and to lead with feelings over logic this time, which is not something I naturally do,\u201d she told TODAY.com \u201cAnd honestly, it\u2019s weird, because when you date in the pods, it doesn\u2019t feel like a crush. You feel deeply and madly in love in an insane amount of time.\u201d",
      "Adionser and Francis follow Season 2 couples Iyanna McNeely and Jarrette Jones and Danielle Ruhl and Nick Thompson as the only \u201cLove Is Blind\u201d pairs who have broken up after saying \u201cI do\u201d on the show."

After seeing the truth, Dain frees Violet just as Xaden and Garrick arrive. Xaden and Violet then kill Varrish together.",

      "Violet decides to sacrifice herself, pouring all of her power into the wardstone knowing she will die from it. Just before Violet burns out, her mother kicks her aside and forces Sloane to siphon all of her power into the stone. Lilith and her dragon die in an act of sacrifice for her children, and the wards at Basgiath are restored.",
      "The wyvern fall with the wards back up, but a bigger threat looms. It's revealed that while Violet was sacrificing herself, Xaden was taking on a venin general \u2014\u00a0and losing. When Xaden felt Violet dying for him, he channeled power from the Earth so he could save her, turning venin in the process.",
      "Now, in the aftermath of the battle, he reveals his new venin status to Violet, and she looks on in horror.",

      "After nearly eighteen months at Basgiath War College, Violet Sorrengail knows there\u2019s no more time for lessons. No more time for uncertainty.",
      "Because the battle has truly begun, and with enemies closing in from outside their walls and within their ranks, it\u2019s impossible to know who to trust.",
      "Now Violet must journey beyond the failing Aretian wards to seek allies from unfamiliar lands to stand with Navarre. The trip will test every bit of her wit, luck, and strength, but she will do anything to save what she loves\u2014her dragons, her family, her home, and\u00a0him.",

    "summary": "During a sit down with Drew Barrymore, Glenn Close revealed the alternative ending to the 1987 thriller \"Fatal Attraction.\"",
    "story": [
      "This story contains spoilers for the movie \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d",
      "Of her many notable roles, Glenn Close is probably best known for her portrayal of Alex Forrest in the 1987 thriller \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d",
      "The film features Close and Michael Douglas as two strangers who meet at a work event and begin an illicit affair that sours after Douglas\u2019 married character, Dan Gallagher, tries to break off their romance.",
      "Instead of going their separate ways, Close's character, Forrest, suffers a psychotic break and begins to stalk Gallagher, his wife and their young daughter. Forrest's behavior becomes increasingly more violent leading to the film's memorable ending.",
      "However, it was an ending that Close says wasn't originally scripted.",
      "\u201cThere was an original ending that didn't end up in the original film,\u201d Close revealed during a recent segment on \u201cThe Drew Barrymore Show.\u201d",
      "Fans of the Oscar-nominated thriller may remember that throughout \u201cFatal Attraction,\u201d Close's character becomes increasingly agitated over being spurned by Gallagher, leading to a climactic ending in which she breaks into the couple's home, boils the family pet rabbit in a pot, then attempts to kill her former lover with a butcher knife.",
      "In the end, Gallagher and Forrest battle it out in the bathroom before Forrest is ultimately shot to death by his wife, Beth (played by Anne Archer).",
      "However, according to Close, that ending was much different than was was in the script with Forrest, an ardent fan of \u201cMadame Butterfly,\u201d emulating the opera's tragic ending the film's original finale.",
      "\u201cIn the original ending (Forrest and Gallagher) have that terrible fight and then she takes that same knife and as \u2018Madam Butterfly\u2019 is playing, she cuts her throat and she dies,\u201d Close told Barrymore, who audibly gasped out loud.",
      "\u201cDid they shoot that scene?\u201d asked Barrymore. \u201cThey did shoot that scene,\u201d Close replied.",
      "But according to Close, that alternate ending never made it to theaters because test audiences hated it. Specifically, they hated Close's character.",
      "\u201cThe audience hated (Forrest) so much for coming between that perfect little family, even though (Gallagher) cheated on his beautiful wife, that they felt she needed to be punished even more, so they came back and told me that they're going to re-shoot it,\u201d said Close.",
      "The decision surprised Close, who says she did research and interviews ahead of the role, determining that she \u201cwould have done herself in before she would have killed, she was not a psychopath,\u201d explained Close.",
      "In fact, upon learning of the film's new ending, Close says she refused to do it, but changed her mind after a meeting with the film's director, Adrian Lyne, producers and Michael Douglas.",
      "\u201cI was saying, \u2018What if it was you? What if it was your character? What did you do?\u2019 Like, I was so furious,\u201d she said.",
      "The decision to re-shoot led to an Oscar-nomination for Close, as well as five others for the film in 1988, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress for Archer and a Best Director nod for Lyne."

    "summary": "President Donald Trump rescinded sanctions imposed by the Biden administration on Israeli settler groups and individuals accused of attacking Palestinians.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Hours after President Donald Trump rescinded American sanctions on far-right settler groups and individuals accused of involvement in violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, Israel\u2019s military said it had launched a \u201csignificant\u201d operation in the territory.",
      "Israeli forces moved into the northern city of Jenin in an offensive that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said was launched to \u201cdefeat terrorism.\u201d Health authorities in the region said at least seven people were killed and dozens injured.",
      "It came after his military said \u201cIsraeli civilians,\u201d some of them masked, had attacked a Palestinian village Monday night before they turned on their own soldiers.",
      "Introduced by the Biden administration in February, Executive Order 14115 saw sanctions imposed on \u201cpersons undermining peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.\u201d",
      "But in a major policy reversal, the White House website said Monday that Trump\u00a0had done away with the measures, which barred Americans from dealing with both Israeli settlers and entities associated with them while freezing their U.S. assets.",
      "It came after Trump described Gaza as a \u201cphenomenal location\u201d as he signed a series of executive orders in the Oval Office, shortly after his presidential inauguration ceremony.",
      "The decision to rescind the sanctions came a day after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas came into effect, bringing a pause to Israel's 15-month military offensive in Gaza. After phase one of the deal began Sunday, three Israeli women held hostage by Hamas were released in exchange for 90 Palestinian teenagers and women who were imprisoned or detained by Israel.",
      "During his first term, Trump abandoned the long-held U.S. position that the settlements are illegal before it was restored by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump's reversal was welcomed by ultranationalist Israeli politicians including Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir, who resigned from his role as justice minister after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government voted to accept the ceasefire agreement.",
      "Calling the sanctions \u201cblatant foreign interference in the internal affairs of the State of Israel,\u201d Smotrich said Tuesday in a post on X, that they had \u201charmed\u201d relations between the United States and Israel. Ben-Gvir also took to X where he praised the \u201crighting of an injustice.\u201d",
      "Much of the world's attention has focused on the Gaza Strip during the 15 months of conflict, which began Oct. 7, 2023, when Israeli officials say 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage in Hamas' multipronged attacks on Israel, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Israel\u2019s military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000 people since then, according to health officials in the enclave, though researchers have estimated that the death toll could be significantly higher.",
      "In the year leading up to the Hamas attacks, 253 Palestinians were killed in the occupied West Bank according to\u00a0a database kept by the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA.",
      "Violence by settlers and Israeli military operations have soared since then and in the months leading up to Jan. 15, the database shows 828 Palestinians have been killed in the territory.",
      "In the year leading up to the Hamas attacks, 33 Israelis were killed in the West Bank, the database shows. Between that date and Jan. 6, the last date it was updated, it shows that 28 have been killed.",
      "Within hours of Monday's announcement from the White House, the  Israeli military said in a statement that dozens of \u201cIsraeli civilians,\u201d some of them masked, raided the Palestinian village of Al-Funduq. There, they \u201cinstigated riots, set property on fire and caused damage,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Troops were dispatched to the scene where they were attacked by Israelis, some of whom threw rocks, the statement added.",
      "A joint investigation into the incident had been opened by the Department of Internal Police Investigations and the Military Police Criminal Investigation Division, the statement said.",
      "Asked Tuesday whether any of those involved were arrested and charged, the IDF referred NBC News to the Israel Police. The police force did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Netanyahu said in a statement Tuesday that the IDF, police and the country\u2019s domestic security agency known as the Shin Bet had launched an \"extensive and significant military operation\u201d to \u201cdefeat terrorism\u201d in Jenin, a city in the West Bank\u2019s north, calling the offensive \"Iron Wall.\"",
      "Palestinian health officials said in a statement that at least seven people were killed and around 35 injured as a result of the operation.",
      "Referring to the region as Judea and Samaria, the biblical names for the West Bank, Smotrich said in a separate statement that the operation would help to \u201cchange the security perception\u201d about the region.",
      "The operation was launched after the United Nations Human Rights Office said in a statement Monday that it was \u201calarmed by a wave of renewed violence perpetrated by settlers and Israeli security forces in the Occupied West Bank.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis has been accompanied by increased restrictions on Palestinians\u2019 freedom of movement across the West Bank, including complete closure of some checkpoints and installation of new gates, effectively confining entire communities,\u201d it added.",
      "Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River since the 1967 Middle East war, building and expanding Jewish settlements there that most countries consider illegal, an assertion Israel rejects."

      "There are differences of opinion as to the reason for the unexpected delay in the Americans\u2019 release, one of the sources said.",
      "The Taliban had earlier confirmed that they were holding Corbett, an American arrested in Afghanistan in August 2022 and whom the State Department had classified as wrongfully detained.",
      "\"Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan\u2019s life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,\" his family said in a statement on their website early Tuesday.",

      "The two sources with direct knowledge of the deal also said that Muhammad had been released.",
      "According to the U.S. Justice Department, Muhammad was convicted in 2008 on narcoterrorism and heroin distribution charges. It said Muhammad had sought to acquire rockets for attacks on Americans and their allies in Afghanistan, and purchased opium meant to be converted into heroin and sent to the United States.",

      "The Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Negotiations have been ongoing for two years, a third diplomat with knowledge of the release said, with several rounds of talks between the U.S. and Taliban mediated by the Qataris in Doha.",
      "Qatar played a sizable role in facilitating the Americans\u2019 release, one of the sources with direct knowledge said, adding that Carstens, who led the negotiations for the U.S., was in Doha for the exchange.",
      "Both the Corbett family and the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed thanks to the government of Qatar for its mediation efforts.",
      "Corbett, a longtime resident of Afghanistan before the withdrawal of U.S.-led forces in 2021, was visiting the country at the time of his arrest. He was said to be experiencing declining health during his detention.",
      "Less is known about McKenty, whose family had kept his case private.",
      "The Corbett family said they were thinking of those still waiting for the return of other Americans held in Afghanistan, including the families of George Glezmann and Mahmoud Habibi, whose release has recently been reported as a possibility.",
      "\"It was our hope that Ryan, George and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,\" they said. \"We recognize the immense privilege of our family\u2019s reunion today, and pledge to keep praying \u2014 and fighting \u2014 for George and Mahmoud\u2019s swift release.\"",
      "The Taliban had said the accusations against the three Americans included spying and preaching Christianity in Afghanistan, which the Taliban rules according to Islamic law.",
      "Biden spoke with family members of Corbett, Glezmann and Habibi this month.",
      "During his four years in office, Biden brought back more than 75 American citizens and residents detained around the world, including in prisoner swaps with China and Russia.",

    "story": [
      "Israel\u2019s top general resigned on Tuesday, citing the security and intelligence failures related to Hamas\u2019 surprise attack that triggered\u00a0the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel meanwhile launched a large operation in the occupied West Bank, killing at least six people, according to Palestinian officials.",
      "Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi is the most senior Israeli figure to resign over the security breakdown on Oct. 7, 2023, when thousands of Hamas-led militants\u00a0carried out a land, sea and air assault\u00a0into southern Israel, rampaging through army bases and nearby communities for hours.",
      "The attack killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and the militants abducted another 250. More than 90 captives are still being held in Gaza, around a third of whom are believed to be dead.",
      "Halevi\u2019s resignation came just days into a fragile ceasefire with Hamas that could lead to an end to the war and the return of the remaining captives. Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman, head of Israel\u2019s Southern Command, which oversees operations in Gaza, also tendered his resignation.",
      "The resignation of the two senior generals will likely add to calls for a public inquiry into the Oct. 7 failures, something Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 whose leadership could be implicated \u2014 has said must wait until the war is over.",
      "Halevi had also appeared to be at odds with Israel\u2019s new defense minister, Israel Katz, over the direction of the war, with Halevi saying Israel had accomplished most of its goals and Katz echoing Netanyahu\u2019s vow to keep fighting until \u201ctotal victory\u201d over Hamas.",
      "In his letter of resignation, Halevi said the military, under his command, had \u201cfailed in its mission to defend the State of Israel\u201d when Hamas attacked but had made \u201csignificant achievements\u201d in the ensuing war, which rippled across the Middle East.",
      "Halevi, who began what was meant to be a three-year term in January 2023 said his resignation would go into effect March 6.",
      "Israel meanwhile announced a \u201csignificant and broad military operation\u201d against Palestinian militants in Jenin. The city has seen repeated Israeli incursions and gunbattles with militants in recent years, even before the outbreak of the Gaza war.",
      "The Palestinian Health Ministry said at least six people were killed and 35 wounded. It does not distinguish between militants and civilians in its tally.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war. The Palestinians seek an independent state encompassing all three territories.",
      "The ceasefire with Hamas does not apply to the West Bank, which has seen a surge of violence since the start of the war. Israeli troops have carried out\u00a0near-daily raids that often ignite gunbattles.",
      "There has also been a rise in attacks on Palestinians by Jewish extremists \u2014 including a rampage in two Palestinian villages overnight Monday \u2014 as well as Palestinian attacks on Israelis.",
      "Hamas condemned the Israeli operation in Jenin, calling on Palestinians in the occupied West Bank to step up their own attacks.",
      "The smaller and more radical Islamic Jihad militant group also condemned the operation, saying it reflected Israel\u2019s \u201cfailure to achieve its goals in Gaza.\u201d It said it was also a \u201cdesperate attempt\u201d by Netanyahu to save his governing coalition.",
      "Netanyahu has faced criticism from his far-right allies over the ceasefire, which required Israeli troops to pull back from populated areas in Gaza and envisions the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, including militants convicted of involvement in deadly attacks on Israelis.",
      "The ceasefire is supposed to last for six weeks and see 33 militant-held\u00a0hostages\u00a0released in return for hundreds of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.\u00a0Three hostages and 90 prisoners\u00a0were released on Sunday, when it took effect.",
      "The truce has already seen\u00a0Hamas return to the streets, showing that it remains in firm control of the territory despite 15 months of war that killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and\u00a0caused widespread devastation.",
      "One of Netanyahu\u2019s erstwhile partners, Itamar Ben-Gvir,\u00a0quit the government\u00a0the day the ceasefire went into effect, weakening the coalition but still leaving Netanyahu with a parliamentary majority. Another, far-right leader, Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, has threatened to bolt if Israel does not resume the war after the first phase of the ceasefire ends in six weeks.",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign has killed over 47,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health authorities, who say women and children make up more than half of the fatalities but do not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."

    "story": [
      "In a freewheeling Inauguration Day of speeches, casual remarks and formal balls, President Donald Trump wasted no time trying to shape the world in his unmistakable image.",
      "Unlike four years ago, when his term began in a flurry of unpreparedness, this time Trump let fly with a series of actions and statements that seek to scrub many of former President Joe Biden\u2019s decisions and replace them with Trump's own stark imprimatur.",
      "From tariffs, TikTok and the Middle East to the climate crisis and world health, here are the headlines of Trump\u2019s foreign policy moves during the first 24 hours of a term set to last 1,461 days \u2014 and how the world reacted.",
      "Russia",
      "The president previously claimed he would end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours of taking office. \u201cThis is only half a day. I have another half a day left,\u201d he said Monday.",
      "That idea sparked alarm in Europe, which worries that Trump could force Ukraine into a negotiation that favors Russian President Vladimir Putin. Trump has more recently stretched this timeline to as long as six months, which some have taken as a signal of support for Ukraine.",
      "On Monday, Trump appeared to criticize Putin \u2014 one of the authoritarian leaders he has spoken warmly about in the past, saying he is \u201cnot doing so well.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not making him look very good,\u201d Trump said of how the war is going for Putin, adding that he was \u201cdestroying Russia by not making a deal.\u201d",

The 2020 Abraham Accords, establishing relations between Israel and several Middle Eastern and North African countries, was perhaps the first Trump administration\u2019s biggest foreign policy achievement.",

      "Now he suggests these tariffs could be used to force through a deal in which the U.S. acquires half of the social media platform TikTok. An executive order Trump signed Monday postponed for 75 days a Biden law that requires the Chinese tech giant ByteDance to sell its stake in TikTok or see the platform banned in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. should be entitled to get half of TikTok,\u201d Trump told reporters. Asked about ByteDance\u2019s close ties with the Chinese government, he said he \u201ccould see a deal\u201d in which the U.S. \u201cpolices it a little \u2014 maybe a lot.\u201d",
      "Trump also reiterated his comments about the Panama Canal and \u201ctaking it back,\u201d claiming the key waterway was being controlled by China.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing Tuesday that Beijing was \u201cwilling to work with the new U.S. administration, adhering to the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence\u201d \u2014 perhaps hinting at past clashes.",
      "Europe's far right",
      "While U.S. inaugurations have historically been largely domestic affairs, figures on the global political right \u2014 including some on its extreme hard-right populist fringes \u2014 were invited to Washington on Monday.",
      "Among them were lawmakers from Alternative for Germany, a far-right nationalist party under surveillance by Berlin for suspected extremism that Trump ally Elon Musk has recently championed.",
      "Italy\u2019s staunch anti-immigration Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also attended.",
      "Hungary's populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, a longtime Trump ally, said Trump's inauguration would aid the far-right's political assault on the European Union's mainstream.",
      "\u201cSo the great attack can start,\" he said at an event in Budapest. \"Hereby I launch the second phase of the offensive that aims to occupy Brussels.\u201d",
      "He is an arch antagonist of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who offered her own assessment.",
      "\u201cWe have entered a new era of harsh geostrategic competition,\u201d she said in a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \u201cBreaking the bonds in the global economy is in no one\u2019s interest.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump alarmed European leaders by suggesting he might not defend them against Russia unless they paid more toward defense. He reiterated his latest demand Monday for those countries to contribute 5% of their gross domestic products toward defense, more than double NATO's recommendation.",
      "He has also unnerved Denmark by suggesting he might take its autonomous territory of Greenland by force.",
      "Climate change",
      "As expected, one of Trump\u2019s first executive orders was to leave the 2016 Paris climate change accord, in which countries agreed to limit post-industrial temperature rises to 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius (2.7 to 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "This will put the United States alongside Yemen, Iran and Libya as nonsignatories to the deal, which Trump said was a \u201crip-off\u201d but experts say is still humanity\u2019s best hope at limiting catastrophe.",
      "Earlier this month, the Biden administration announced a ban \u2014 which would require an act of Congress to reverse \u2014 on new offshore oil and gas drilling along most of the U.S. coastline.",
      "Even so, the Paris agreement does not \"reflect our country\u2019s values,\u201d the White House said, with Trump instead promising to \"drill, baby, drill.\u201d",
      "The WHO",
      "It was likewise anticipated that Trump would junk Washington\u2019s role in the World Health Organization. He has alleged that the global health body aided Chinese government efforts to \u201cmislead the world\u201d over Covid \u2014 something both the WHO and Beijing deny.",
      "The U.S. is by far the WHO\u2019s biggest financial backer, providing 18% of its $6.8 billion budget. Signing an executive order to leave the WHO, Trump said that China\u2019s lower contribution but higher population \u201cseems a little unfair to me.\u201d",
      "Experts say that leaving the organization could undermine worldwide programs to tackle diseases such as tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS."

    "published": "Sun, 19 Jan 2025 13:41:36 GMT",
    "summary": "Steve Witkoff was Donald Trump\u2019s man in the room as the ceasefire and hostage release deal was forged between Israel and Hamas.",
    "story": [
      "He was Donald Trump\u2019s man in the room as the ceasefire and hostage release deal was forged between Israel and Hamas, but Steve Witkoff is no diplomat despite his appointment as the president-elect\u2019s special envoy to the Middle East.",
      "Instead, he brought to the negotiating table decades of experience clinching some of New York\u2019s biggest real estate deals, as well as opening up about his very personal loss during the arduous talks.",
      "Born in the Bronx, the billionaire real estate developer could hardly have a more different profile from those of the American diplomats who usually craft complicated international agreements. Witkoff, 67, was raised in Long Island and trained as a real estate lawyer before charting a path in the rough-and-tumble world of New York real estate development.",
      "He has known Trump for decades, is a Republican donor and served on one of Trump\u2019s Great American Economic Revival Industry Groups to combat the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. He\u2019s also going to be one of the speakers at Trump\u2019s pre-inauguration rally Sunday, alongside Hulk Hogan, Megyn Kelly, Elon Musk and others.",
      "Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al Thani made a clear reference to Witkoff, who is Jewish and has done business throughout the Middle East, during a Wednesday press conference confirming that a Hamas-Israel ceasefire deal had been reached.",
      "\u201cWhat we have seen from the U.S. in the past few days, seeing a collaboration transcending both administrations, was a clear demonstration for the commitment of the U.S. to reach to that deal,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed, a key mediator in the talks, told the crowd of reporters and dignitaries, which included Witkoff himself. \u201cAnd I really would like to thank both the envoys who are here with us in the last couple of days, and they played a vital role in reaching to this moment.\u201d",
      "A senior administration official close to the negotiations also told NBC News that Witkoff had been \u201cvery helpful, in particular ironing out a couple of issues\u201d on the \u201cvery complex deal.\u201d They added that he had been \u201cworking seamlessly\u201d on the effort with Brett McGurk, the White House coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa.",
      "\u201cI have to say, Brett McGurk has been very fortunate to have been joined in these last 96 hours by Steve Witkoff\u201d in what \u201chas really been a historic and crucial partnership between the two of them to help nail down some of the final arrangements,\u201d the official said.",
      "Witkoff brought \u201ca new energy and a new dynamic\u201d to the table, a person familiar with the negotiations said in a separate interview before the deal was announced. \u201cHe\u2019s very much engaged and his heart is in the right place.\u201d",
      "A Middle Eastern diplomat who spoke with NBC News on condition of anonymity said Witkoff, as well as being a tough negotiator, talked about his son Andrew, who died of an OxyContin overdose in 2011 at age 22, telling \u201cofficials he empathizes with parents who have lost children on both sides.\u201d",
      "Neither Witkoff nor his office responded to requests for comment on this story."

      "Ichiro made his debut with the Mariners in 2001, becoming the first Japanese position player to join Major League Baseball. That season he won both the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards.",
      "He went on to be a 10-time All Star and earned 10 Gold Glove awards for exceptional defense, as well as three Silver Slugger awards for his elite batting. Ichiro earned a reputation as an exceptional leadoff hitter (with a .311 career batting average) and as a formidable right fielder who, even at 5-foot-9, was known to scale outfield walls to rob home runs.",
      "Ichiro racked up 3,089 hits in MLB after having already played nine years in Japan\u2019s Nippon Professional Baseball league. Combining his hits from both leagues, he had 4,367 hits across his professional career, the most of any player in baseball history.",
      "Ichiro told NBC News in a 2022 interview that he endured his share of challenges after he arrived in Seattle and that he was intensely aware of how American fans would perceive him. While he said he didn\u2019t set out to \u201cperform for Asians,\u201d he knew his performance would be scrutinized if he didn\u2019t deliver.",
      "\u201cAs a player from Japan, as a guy that had led the league in hitting all seven years and then coming over being a first position player, I knew that I would be judged. And Japan baseball will be judged on how I did,\u201d he said through a translator. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t able to produce, then they would judge Japan baseball as being at a lower level. And so that pressure was there, and that\u2019s what I had to carry.\u201d",

In 2019, he retired with the Mariners, playing his final game at the Tokyo Dome against the Oakland Athletics.",

      "The start of Prince\u00a0Harry\u2019s court battle against Rupert Murdoch\u2019s British newspaper group was delayed at London\u2019s High Court on Tuesday amid chaos over last-minute settlement discussions between the two sides.",
      "Harry\u00a0and former senior lawmaker Tom Watson are suing News Group Newspapers over alleged unlawful activities carried out by journalists and private investigators working for its papers, the Sun and the defunct News of the World, from 1996 until 2011.",
      "At what was supposed to be the start of an eight-week trial,\u00a0Harry\u00a0and Watson\u2019s lawyer David Sherborne asked the judge, Timothy Fancourt, for more time.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure your lordship can understand why that might be needed,\u201d Sherborne said without elaborating.",
      "After an hour-long delay, Sherborne asked for further time to continue discussions. Fancourt granted the request but said it must be the \u201clast adjournment\u201d and proceedings would get under way in the afternoon if no agreement were reached.",
      "Sherborne subsequently asked for further time to negotiate, supported by NGN\u2019s lawyer Anthony Hudson, who cited \u201ctime difference difficulties\u201d in a possible reference to\u00a0Harry, who lives in California.",
      "Fancourt said he did not think the court filings contained anything that would have an impact on attempts to settle, to which Hudson said that \u201cthere are other matters which will occur when the trial starts which will have a very significant impact on the settlement dynamic.\u201d",
      "Fancourt declined to give the parties more time, and said that some of the two sides\u2019 lawyers could continue to discuss a possible deal while the trial began.",
      "Asked by Hudson to hold a short discussion in private, Fancourt replied: \u201cI\u2019m not going to start having secret hearings about what\u2019s going on.\u201d",
      "The judge also refused permission to appeal, though the parties can appeal directly at the Court of Appeal.",
      "The prince has said his mission is not money but to get to the truth, after other claimants settled cases to avoid the risk of a multi-million dollar legal bill that could be imposed even if they won in court but had rejected NGN\u2019s offer.",
      "\u201cOne of the main reasons for seeing this through is accountability, because I\u2019m the last person that can actually achieve that,\u201d\u00a0Harry, who is set to appear as a witness himself in February, said last month.",
      "NGN has paid out hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of phone-hacking and other unlawful information gathering by the News of the World, and settled more than 1,300 lawsuits involving celebrities, politicians, well-known sports figures and ordinary people who were connected to them or major events.",

      "While Murdoch closed the News of the World in 2011, the publisher has always rejected claims there was any unlawful activity at the Sun and says it will fully defend the claims.",

    "story": [
      "BANGKOK \u2014 They have been in a committed relationship for more than 13 years, and even had a wedding in 2019. Since then, Danaya Phonphayung and Sunma Piamboon, both women, have considered themselves a married couple, even if same-sex marriages were not legally recognized.",
      "The walls of their home in suburban Bangkok are decorated with faded photos from their happy union, filled with joy and love from their families and friends. Come this Thursday, their wedded status will be recognized by the nation as well, when a law that allows members of the LGBTQ community in Thailand to get married and have the same legal rights as heterosexual couples takes effect.",
      "The couple said they can\u2019t wait to formalize their union. They plan to register their marriage at a district office near their home on the very first day that the law allows.",
      "\u201cI think I\u2019ll cry,\u201d Danaya, an office worker, said with a big smile, thinking about the moment that they will sign the paper. \u201cI\u2019m so happy. It\u2019s something that was more than I could\u2019ve dreamed of, that suddenly this day is happening.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe live together. We bought a house. We bought a car. But we cannot share these things together like a married couple. When this is happening, we feel that it\u2019s our rights that we need to secure as quickly as possible,\u201d she said.",
      "The marriage equality bill, which sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate, amended the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words \u201cmen and women\u201d and \u201chusband and wife\u201d to \u201cindividuals\u201d and \u201cmarriage partners.\u201d It would open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBTQ couples.",

So, I think this is very important for both of us.\u201d",
      "How marriage equality became law",
      "Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity, but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values. Members of the LGBTQ community say they face discrimination in everyday life, although they note that things have improved greatly in recent years.",
      "The government led by the Pheu Thai party made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok\u2019s busiest commercial districts.",
      "Last week, Government House invited dozens of LGBTQ couples and activists for a photo op and a meeting with Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra and several high ranking officials to celebrate the law coming into effect, making Thailand the first in Southeast Asia and the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to legalize same-sex marriage.",
      "\u201cIt is almost like a dream, but it\u2019s not. So, congratulations to all,\u201d Paetongtarn said. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that the world notice us, and know that in this small country we have this kind of thought. We have this kind of support for our people. So, we all should be proud.\u201d",
      "The organizers of Bangkok Pride have collaborated with relevant government agencies to hold a grand celebration in central Bangkok and facilitate couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day. They said that more than 300 couples have registered to officially tie the knot on Thursday at the event.",
      "\u201c(The law) is about returning our dignity, and confirming that we also have dignity as a human being,\u201d said Ann \u201cWaaddao\u201d Chumaporn, a gender equality activist and the lead organizer of Bangkok Pride. \u201cThat day is going to be meaningful to all the couples that have gone through this journey together. I\u2019d like to thank everyone, every love, that has faithfully struggled so that today would finally happen.\u201d",
      "How the law will be implemented",
      "The government and state agencies in Thailand are historically traditional in outlook. To prepare them for change, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration said that it has organized workshops for staff of all Bangkok district offices who are in charge of handling marriage registration. They included lectures raising awareness about gender diversity and guidance on how to properly communicate with those who come for the service.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a missing piece of the jigsaw,\u201d Bangkok Deputy Gov. Sanon Wangsrangboon said at one of the workshops earlier this month. \u201cSociety is ready. The law is getting ready. But the last piece of the jigsaw is the understanding from officials.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged there that would be problems in the beginning, but said that he hoped they would gradually improve over time.",
      "After they register their marriage, Sunma said that she\u2019s looking forward to having a \u201creal marriage celebration\u201d with her and Danaya\u2019s families.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just the two of us that are happy, but both of our families feel it is a big deal, and it is what everyone has been waiting for. Everyone said they are waiting for Jan. 23,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Denuclearization of North Korea is imperative, South Korea said Tuesday after President Donald Trump described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power.\u201d",
    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Denuclearization of North Korea is a prerequisite for global stability, South Korea said Tuesday after President Donald Trump described the reclusive regime as a \u201cnuclear power,\u201d raising concern that the U.S. could be moving toward recognizing the North as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "Since Trump was last in office, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to \u201cexponentially\u201d boost his nuclear arsenal and ramped up weapons testing, including of missiles that could potentially strike the continental United States and overwhelm U.S. treaty ally South Korea.",
      "The newly inaugurated Trump, who met with Kim three times during his first term to discuss North Korea\u2019s U.N.-sanctioned weapons programs, spoke enthusiastically Monday about his past relationship with Kim, saying they liked each other.",
      "\u201cNow, he is a nuclear power,\u201d Trump said while signing a series of executive orders in the Oval Office. \u201cI think he\u2019ll be happy to see I\u2019m coming back.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s defense secretary nominee, Pete Hegseth, also called North Korea a \u201cnuclear power\u201d during his Senate confirmation hearing last week.",
      "While it is unclear what Trump and Hegseth meant by \u201cnuclear power,\u201d U.S. officials have long refrained from using the phrase as it could signal recognition of North Korea as a nuclear-armed state.",
      "The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.",
      "Though there is growing debate as to whether the international community should accept North Korea\u2019s nuclear status, experts say doing so would significantly disrupt the geopolitical balance in the region and potentially set off an arms race, including the possible development of nuclear weapons by South Korea and Japan.",
      "South Korea said Tuesday that North Korea \u201ccan never be recognized as a nuclear-armed state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNorth Korea\u2019s denuclearization remains a consistent principle upheld by the international community, including South Korea and the U.S.,\u201d a spokesperson for the South Korean Foreign Ministry said.",
      "A spokesperson for the South Korean defense ministry said the denuclearization of North Korea was \u201can essential condition for lasting peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but also worldwide, and it must continue to be pursued.\u201d",
      "Though denuclearization has long been the goal, talks with North Korea have been stalled since Trump and Kim\u2019s 2019 summit in Hanoi, Vietnam. There is speculation that Trump could seek another in-person meeting with the North Korean leader.",
      "On Monday, Trump asked about Kim while speaking with U.S. service members stationed in South Korea, which hosts almost 30,000 U.S. troops.",
      "\u201cHow\u2019s Kim Jong Un?\u201d he said during a video call from the stage at the Commander in Chief Ball.",
      "Trump is \u201cnot a leader for legal nuances or diplomatic sensitivities,\u201d said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.",
      "\u201cFor Trump, it is a simple fact that North Korea has nuclear weapons, and it is straightforward that states with nuclear weapons must get along to avoid war,\u201d he said in an email.",
      "The danger for Seoul, Easley said, is that U.S.-South Korea efforts to deter North Korea from advancing its weapons programs, which strengthened during the Biden administration, could take a back seat to Trump\u2019s \u201cpersonalistic diplomacy.\u201d",
      "\u201cAny uncoordinated policy change regarding North Korean denuclearization could leave Seoul vulnerable to Pyongyang\u2019s coercion,\u201d he said.",
      "Stella Kim reported from Seoul, South Korea, and Mithil Aggarwal from Hong Kong."

      "\u201cToday, out of a population of 40 million, we are committing injustice against 20 million people,\u201d he added, referring to the female population of Afghanistan.",

      "They made a sharp U-turn on promises to open high schools for girls in 2022, and have since said they are working on a plan for the schools to reopen but have not given any timeline. They closed universities to female students at the end of 2022.",
      "The policies have been widely criticized internationally, including by Islamic scholars, and Western diplomats have said any path toward formal recognition of the\u00a0Taliban\u00a0is blocked until there is a change on their policies toward women.",
      "A\u00a0Taliban\u00a0administration spokesman in the southern city of Kandahar, where Haibatullah is based, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Stanekzai\u2019s remarks."

      "OTAY MESA, Calif. \u2014 It was a quiet morning as border agents patrolled the primary and secondary fences that divide San Diego and Tijuana as the nation awaited newly sworn-in President Donald Trump to sign a series of immigration-related executive orders.",
      "In his first speech as president, Trump said he \"will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came.\"",
      "Trump vowed to reinstate \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d a policy from his first administration requiring anyone seeking to enter the United States through Mexico to remain in that country.",

      "\"If they reinstate it, this is something we don\u2019t agree with. We have a different focus. We want to adjust it,\" Juan Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, Mexico's secretary for external relations, said in a news conference Monday morning.

      "Families and onlookers waited for hours in the cold to greet their loved before white buses transported them out of Ofer Prison, an Israeli facility in the occupied West Bank. A celebratory mood coursed through the crowd, with some families sharing food and cotton candy being sold on the street.",
      "Children carrying balloons lit up with fairy lights ran around, while men sang around a blazing fire. Some people carried flags in support of the Hamas militant group before the prisoners, including a teenager and a political activist, were freed.",
      "Three Israeli women \u2014 Doron Steinbrecher, 31, Emily Damari, 28, and Romi Gonen, 24 \u2014 were released Sunday, the first of the hostages held by Hamas to be freed as part of an agreement that ends the fighting in Gaza after almost 15 months of war.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the freed Palestinians.",
      "Shortly after her sister Jeneen Amro was released, Boshara Amro, 21, said in a voice note that her feelings were \u201cindescribable.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s my big sister,\u201d Amro, 21, said. \u201cShe\u2019s like a mother to me, in her kindness and in everything she does.\u201d",
      "During that time, she said, she had no contact with Jeneen, 23, and was unable to visit her in prison. Her freedom brings \u201cfeelings of joy, happiness and pleasure,\u201d Amro said. But she added that her family was appalled by her sister's \u201cvery bad mental state, especially the mental and physical stress she was subjected to.\u201d",
      "Her sister, she said, was \u201cin a state of shock\u201d from her time in detention.",
      "Before her sister was released, Amro said, her family had not been told why Jeneen was detained in their home city of Hebron in the West Bank. The Israeli military and the country's prison's service did not immediately respond to questions about why she was arrested.",
      "Mahmoud Aliowat, 15, was the youngest detainee to be released, according to a list Hamas provided to The Associated Press. It is unclear where he was detained and for how long.",
      "Also on the list was Khalida Jarrar, 62, a leading member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, which the U.S. deemed a terror organization in 1997 and 2001.\u00a0The Treasury Department also accused it of participating in the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks on Israel.",
      "As Jarrar was led through a cheering crowd, several people helped her walk and many on social media commented that her once dark hair had grayed during her time in custody. Others suggested the former lawmaker looked exhausted.",
      "Rights groups like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have suggested that Jarrar, an outspoken critic of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories, has been targeted by Israeli authorities for her political activities.",
      "Since her arrest at her home in the West Bank city of Ramallah in late 2023, Jarrar has been held under indefinitely renewable administrative detention, the widely criticized practice under which Israel holds detainees indefinitely without trial or other legal proceedings based on evidence that is not shared with either the detainee or their families.",
      "Dalal Khaseeb, 53,\u00a0was also on the list provided to the AP, which reported she is the sister of Saleh Arouri, the former commander of Hamas\u2019 military wing in the West Bank and\u00a0deputy chairman of the group\u2019s political bureau. He was killed in January with six other members of the organization after his home in a suburb in southern Beirut was targeted by a drone strike.",
      "Her son Muhammad Khaseeb, from Ramallah, told the Middle East Eye website that she was detained \u201ca year ago.\u201d",
      "What next?",
      "First announced on Wednesday, the 42-day first phase of the three-part ceasefire deal will see at least 33 hostages released from Gaza in the coming six weeks in exchange for a pause in fighting, the release of nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners, and increased fuel and aid deliveries into the enclave.",
      "Among the Palestinians set for release are 1,167 people who were detained in Gaza during the war, but did not participate in the Oct. 7 attacks.",
      "The Israel Prison Service described all of the 90 freed Monday as \u201cterrorists,\u201d but a spokesperson for the service did not immediately respond to NBC News when asked to clarify what they had been charged with and sentenced for.",
      "What happens after the deal\u2019s first phase is uncertain. The agreement\u2019s subsequent stages call for the release of more hostages and prisoners and a permanent end to the war, which began with Hamas' deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, in which 1,200 were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies.",
      "Since then, more than 46,800 people have been killed in Gaza during the 15-month offensive launched by Israel after the attacks, according to Gaza health officials.",
      "The Israeli military said Sunday that it would be ramping up operations in the West Bank in advance of the release of prisoners and detainees, with troops expected to be stationed on \u201ckey routes where additional checkpoints will be established.\u201d",
      "It said that was part of an effort to \u201cthwart terrorist activity and violent riots.\u201d",
      "Some Palestinians have expressed concern about the military activity in the area, which comes at a time of heightened violence by Israeli settlers in the West Bank since the war in Gaza began."

      "Those disturbances spread across Britain with attacks on mosques and hotels housing asylum seekers, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer blaming the riots on far-right thuggery. More than 1,500 people were arrested."
