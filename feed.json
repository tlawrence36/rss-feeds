      "Bruce Springsteen has been deliberate in his career, careful with his album releases to keep a narrative flow and not repeat himself",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Bruce Springsteen's new project, \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums,\u201d is entirely about that age-old question: What if?",
      "The box set, out June 27, comprises seven albums encompassing the period between 1983 and 2018, all but one he prepared to release in its time but ultimately shelved. Now that he's decided to drop them simultaneously, they offer a fascinating alternative story of his musical life.",
      "Building on its predecessor \u201cTracks,\u201d 1998's four-disc, 66-song collection of unreleased material, there are 83 songs here. While some slipped out on other projects \u2014 \u201cMy Hometown\u201d and \u201cSecret Garden\u201d among them \u2014 the vast majority hadn't been heard publicly. This is all fully completed material, not half-baked or half-finished outtakes. It's not unusual for artists to leave songs \u2014 or even full-lengths \u2014 on the cutting-room floor, but multiple entire albums? Springsteen explains that he's taken care releasing albums, looking to build a narrative arc for his career, and believes this approach has served him well.",
      "Perhaps as a result, the most interesting work on \u201cTracks II\u201d comes when he stretches out and explores pathways not in his wheelhouse: countrypolitan Bruce, border-town Bruce, Burt Bacharach-inspired Bruce and a set of synthesizer-based songs modeled after his Oscar-winning \u201cStreets of Philadelphia.\u201d Oddly, the one disc of strays cobbled together that feels most like an E Street Band record is the least compelling.",
      "Since these are seven distinct albums, it's worth evaluating them that way.",
      "\u201cLA Garage Sessions '83\u201d captures Springsteen working virtually alone at a home in the Hollywood Hills. It was squarely in between his \u201cNebraska\u201d and \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d albums, and he seems torn between those two approaches. There are character studies here, and more lighthearted fare like \u201cLittle Girl Like You,\u201d with a single man yearning to settle down. The most striking cut is \u201cThe Klansman,\u201d about a boy and his racist father, yet it cries out for more development. Ultimately, Springsteen chose the right albums to release at the time.",
      "The song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia\u201d was a genuine departure musically, and Springsteen decided to make an album in the same vein, with synthesizers and drum loops the dominant elements. If released in the early 1990s, this would have been the most contemporary-sounding disc of his career, with atmospherics that occasionally recall U2. Springsteen pulled it at the last minute, reasoning that the stories of doomed relationships \u2014 sample lyric: \u201cWe loved each other like a disease\u201d \u2014 was too much like \u201cTunnel of Love.\u201d",
      "At the same time he recorded \u201cThe Ghost of Tom Joad\u201d in 1995, Springsteen also convened a country band steered by pedal steel player Marty Rifkin. Their work was terrific, led by the one-two punch of \u201cRepo Man\u201d and the Johnny Rivers cover, \u201cPoor Side of Town.\u201d The title cut to a disc he calls \u201cSomewhere North of Nashville\u201d escaped into the public some two decades later. Since the somber \u201cJoad\u201d won a Grammy, who are we to second-guess his choice of what to put out? \u201cNashville,\u201d though, is a rollicking good time.",
      "\u201cInyo\u201d is similar to \u201cJoad\u201d and \u201cDevils & Dust,\u201d mostly acoustic-based narratives, here many of them stories of the Southwest. Springsteen even appropriately brings in mariachi bands for \u201cAdelita\u201d and \u201cThe Lost Charro.\u201d Soozie Tyrell's violin is notable, particularly on the majestic \u201cWhen I Build My Beautiful House.\u201d We're guessing that Springsteen may have considered \u201cInyo\u201d one album too many in the same style, but it's still strong work.",
      "At one point Springsteen considered making \u201cWestern Stars,\u201d his salute to early 1970s California songwriting, a double album. When he didn't, the songs on \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d were left behind. Here Bacharach is the primary influence, and this almost feels like Elvis Costello's collaboration with Burt, only without him (and is the lyric \u201cGod give me strength\u201d a hat-tip to that project?). The crooning Bruce of \u201cSunday Love\u201d is spellbinding, maybe the box's best song. \u201cLonely Town\u201d sits at the intersection of Bacharach and Roy Orbison, while \u201cDinner at Eight\u201d is a lovely sum-up. \u201cTwilight Hours\u201d may startle Springsteen fans \u2014 and impress them, too.",
      "The workmanlike songs on \u201cFaithless\u201d were written on commission in two weeks, the soundtrack to a movie that was never made. It's a good bet it would have been a moody Western.",
      "When Springsteen duels with Tom Morello on the song \u201cAnother Thin Line,\u201d you realize how little you've heard his electric guitar on \u201cTracks II.\u201d The album \u201cPerfect World\u201d is the one here made up of leftovers from different periods, with the greatest E Street Band participation. Here's the deal, though: Most good E Street Band material has already been released. The best left behind for this disc is \u201cYou Lifted Me Up,\u201d with minimalist lyrics and a vocal collaboration with Patti Scialfa and Steve Van Zandt.",
      "The box gives Springsteen completists plenty to mull over, and you can question whether these \u201clost discs\u201d would get more attention released separately instead of together. If it's too much, he's releasing a 20-song set of its highlights.",

      "The champ is coming back to chomp.",
      "Competitive eater Joey \u201cJaws\u201d Chestnut announced Monday he will return to compete in this year's Nathan\u2019s Famous Fourth of July hot dog eating contest after skipping last year's gastronomic battle for the coveted Mustard Belt.",
      "\u201cThis event means the world to me,\u201d Chestnut, 41, said in a message posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s a cherished tradition, a celebration of American culture, and a huge part of my life.\u201d",
      "It will mark the 20th appearance for the Indiana eater at the Coney Island contest.",
      "Last year, Major League Eating event organizer George Shea said Chestnut, who has won the 10-minute eat-a-thon 16 times, would not be participating due to a contract dispute. Chestnut had struck a deal with a competing brand, the plant-based meat company Impossible Foods.",
      "In a phone interview Monday, the competitive eater made it clear he never appeared in any commercials for the company's vegan hot dogs and that Nathan's is the only hot dog company he has worked with. But Chestnut acknowledged he \u201cshould have made that more clear with Nathan\u2019s.\"",
      "\u201cThere was a little bit of communication that we could have improved on last year,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I, yeah, I think we figured it out. It took a little bit of finessing.\u201d",
      "Chestnut is still working with Impossible Foods and said \u201cclarifications\u201d have been made to his respective contracts.",
      "Richard Shea, president of Major League Eating, said he did not want to rehash what happened last year because he found it \u201cdispiriting,\u201d but said he\u2019s happy \u201ceverything is resolved\u201d now.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s the return of the greatest competitive eater of all time to the biggest competitive eating event of all time. So I don\u2019t think it gets much bigger in any sport,\u201d Shea said. \u201cI mean, this guy is the greatest performer we\u2019ve ever seen in Coney Island and in competitive eating.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he heard from fans over the past year who wanted him to return to the Coney Island event, which is broadcast live on ESPN and even shown overseas.",
      "Last year, he opted to compete against soldiers in Fort Bliss, in El Paso, Texas, in a 5-minute hot dog eating contest. Back in New York, Patrick Bertoletti gobbled up 58 hot dogs to win his first men\u2019s title while defending champion Miki Sudo won her 10th title in the women's division, downing a record 51 links.",
      "Chestnut holds the world record of eating 76 hot dogs.",
      "\u201cOver the last year, I ran into a lot of people who said that it wasn\u2019t the same without me. And I told many people that I was going to work really hard to make sure I got back there,\u201d Chestnut said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m really happy that Nathan\u2019s and Major League Eating, we were able all to figure it out.\u201d",
      "Chestnut said he been prepping for the big event and has a couple practice sessions left before the July Fourth holiday.",
      "\u201cMy body's in tune right now,\u201d he said, explaining how he has to build tolerance for consuming so many hot dogs and \u201cget all those muscles used to working together.\u201d He likened the process to boxer getting in practice rounds before a big fight.",
      "Chestnut made it clear his business relationship with Impossible Foods does not mean he has become a vegan, an assumption he said some fans made last year. Chestnut said he was surprised by the \u201cweird blowback\u201d he received about it, explaining he eats a plant-based diet during his recovery from competitive eating events.",
      "\u201cI love meat. I\u2019m going to continue to eat meat. But when I recover from a contest, I have to eat super clean in order to get my body to try to get back to normal,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t eat pounds of meat every day.\u201d",

      "The Louvre Museum has failed to open on time Monday, leaving thousands of visitors stuck in long, unmoving lines",
      "PARIS -- The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "Thousands of stranded and confused visitors, tickets in hand, were corralled into unmoving lines by I.M. Pei's glass pyramid.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre's spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What's more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff plan to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks.",

      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered his 11th studio album, \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d",
      "Nashville hitmaker Dierks Bentley has delivered \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d his eleventh studio album that leans into some well-tread country rock territory, the kind that invariably involves broken hearts, trucks and a cold beer.",
      "Look, Bentley knows what he\u2019s doing. The album is 11-tracks of catchy, country rock radio filler and there\u2019s not much mystery to its musical roadmap. But therein lies his calling card: Dependable songs with few rough edges.",
      "Thematically, many of the tracks on the superstar\u2019s latest effort hint at internal struggles, but allow Bentley and the listener to escape them unscathed. \u201cJesus Loves Me\u201d is an admirable acoustic slow burn about finding religion but losing a woman. \u201cThought maybe if I hit my knees / She\u2019d think about hitting the brakes,\u201d Bentley sings. There is slight salvation for the Phoenix-born singer: \u201cYeah, Jesus loves me / But she don't.\u201d",
      "On the title track, the jukebox stomp \u201cBroken Branches,\u201d Bentley gets a nice assist from fellow country hitmakers John Anderson and Riley Green. Ostensibly it\u2019s an energetic drinking song about family lines, but lyrics like \u201cWe shoulda gone to college / Coulda gained a little knowledge,\u201d which pull from a popular childhood rhyme, feel like they're underperforming.",
      "What Bentley does extremely well is execute what his \u2014 and the modern genre\u2019s \u2014 biggest fans might expect. Tales of a tough exterior with a warm, if fragile, heart underneath. But his familiar is derivative.",
      "Palatable country is how you get on the radio and stay on it. Songs about beer and trucks are Spotify deliverables. If you like your country artists with a longer rap sheet, you\u2019ll need to look further than \u201cBroken Branches.\u201d Even the few attempts at invention don't totally land, like the rowdy, rocking \u201cShe Hates Me,\u201d which includes a surprising interpolation of post-grunge band Puddle of Mudd\u2019s 2001 hit \u201cShe (Expletive) Hates Me.\u201d",
      "If there\u2019s a pleasant find here, it\u2019s Stephen Wilson Jr. duetting with Bentley on the opening track, \u201cCold Beer Can.\u201d It\u2019s the most memorable song on the album \u2014 with its plucky instrumentation and ascendant chorus, which showcase Wilson Jr.\u2019s rich voice and guitar talents.",
      "It also does what Bentley aims for, but misses, throughout the record: It addresses life's touching moments over brews.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 The Recording Academy has tweaked some of its rules for the 2026 Grammy Awards, including carving out a stand-alone category for best album cover \u2014 a day after Sabrina Carpenter sparked considerable discourse unveiling what is believed to be the cover for her next album.",
      "The academy on Thursday announced that the best recording package and the best boxed or special limited edition package categories will be combined into the best recording package category, with best album cover spun out on its own.

      "\u201cThe Academy\u2019s top priority is to represent the music people that we serve each year,\u201d Harvey Mason jr., CEO of the Recording Academy said in a statement. \u201cThat entails listening carefully to our members to make sure our rules and guidelines reflect today\u2019s music and allow us to accurately recognize as many deserving creators as possible.\u201d",
      "Carpenter revealed the title and release date for her new album, \u201cMan\u2019s Best Friend,\u201d on Wednesday.

      "Willie Nelson is busy as ever at age 92",
      "Willie Nelson's 90th birthday celebration at the Hollywood Bowl could have been mistaken for a retirement party.",
      "But two years later at 92, he's working as much as ever. Not that retirement would look much different. The life he loves is making music with his friends, even after outliving so many dear ones.",
      "Nelson will be on the road again with Bob Dylan when the Outlaw Music Festival resumes for the second leg of its 10th year starting on June 20 in Clarkston, Michigan",
      "Asked if he\u2019d ever like his life to get the feature film treatment that Dylan did last year with \u201cA Complete Unknown, \u201d Nelson said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard some talk about it. But I'm not through with it yet.\u201d",
      "Nelson spoke to The Associated Press in a phone interview from Hawaii's Oahu.",
      "\u201cBob's a good friend,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cAnd I'll be glad to let him headline.\u201d",
      "The tour is one part of a loaded year. It'll lead right up to the 40th anniversary of Farm Aid in September. This spring, Nelson released his 77th studio album. And he's added a new THC tonic, Willie's Remedy, to his wide world of weed products.",
      "Nelson has always loved singing the songs of his friends as much as if not more than the ones he writes himself. In 1979, he released \u201cWillie Nelson Sings Kristofferson,\u201d a full album of the work of his friend Kris Kristofferson, who died last year.",
      "He has similar love for the songs of his friend Rodney Crowell. Nelson has long performed Crowell's \u201cTil I Gain Control Again,\u201d which he called \u201cone of the best country songs that I think I've ever heard.\u201d Now he's released a whole album of Crowell tunes, \u201cOh What a Beautiful World.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo far he hasn\u2019t written one that I don\u2019t like,\u201d Nelson said.",
      "The album comes on the 50th anniversary of \u201cRed Headed Stranger,\u201d the album that many consider Nelson's masterpiece. A breakthrough for him at age 42, it took him from respected journeyman to beloved superstar.",
      "Nelson said he's already begun work on album number 78, but declines to share its direction.",
      "As Nelson returns to the road, the only surviving member of the classic lineup of his Family band is Mickey Raphael, 73, whose harmonica has duetted for decades with the Willie warble.",
      "Bassist Bee Spears died in 2011. Guitarist and backup singer Jody Payne died in 2013. Drummer Paul English died in 2020. And Nelson's sister Bobbie Nelson, his only sibling and his piano player, died in 2022.",
      "But the band he takes on the road now is just as familial in its own way. It often includes his sons Lukas and Micah. English's brother Billy plays the drums. The son of Payne and singer Sammi Smith, Waylon Payne, plays guitar.",
      "They collectively keep up with Nelson's wants and whims on stage. One thing the live show never includes is a set list. He refuses to use them. Band members \u2014 and sound guys, and lighting guys \u2014 have to stay on their toes and be ready for anything.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather play it off the top of my head, because I can read the crowd pretty good,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cThey jump in there.\u201d",
      "The list-less set lately has included classics like \u201cWhiskey River\u201d (always the opener, no guessing to be done there,) and \u201cBloody Mary Morning\u201d along with newer adoptees like Tom Waits' \u201cLast Leaf,\u201d a song that perfectly expresses Nelson's survivor status.",
      "\u201cI'm the last leaf on the tree,\u201d Nelson sings in the song that leads his 2024 album of the same name. \u201cThe autumn took the rest, but it won't take me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy son Micah found that for me,\u201d Nelson said. \u201cI really love the song, and the audience likes it, it\u2019s one of the real good ones.\u201d",
      "He's also been performing songs written by Micah, who records and performs as Particle Boy.",
      "One favorite, \u201cEverything Is B- - - - - -t,\u201d seems to stand in contrast to the gospel standards like \u201cI'll Fly Away\u201d and \u201cWill The Circle Be Unbroken\u201d that he often plays a few minutes later. Willie disagrees.",
      "\u201cIt's all gospel,\u201d he says with a laugh.",
      "September will bring the 40th anniversary addition of Farm Aid, the annual festival to support family farmers, which Nelson founded with Neil Young and John Mellencamp, He performs there annually. It was inspired by one-off charity concerts like \u201cLive Aid,\u201d but became an annual institution, rotating each year to a different farm-adjacent city. It's in Minneapolis this year.",
      "Asked his favorite, he said, \u201cThey\u2019ve all been good, for different reasons. The first one was great, the last one was great.\u201d",

      "Thanks to an agreement with the International Olympic Committee, the renamed marvel will now lift off into the sky each summer evening \u2014 a ghostly echo of last year\u2019s opening ceremony \u2014 from June 21 to Sept. 14, for the next three years.",
      "Gone is the official \u201cOlympic\u201d branding \u2014 forbidden under IOC reuse rules \u2014 but not the spectacle. The 30-meter-tall (98-foot-tall) floating ring, dreamed up by French designer Mathieu Lehanneur and powered by French energy company EDF, simulates flame without fire: LED lights, mist jets and high-pressure fans create a luminous halo that hovers above the city at dusk, visible from rooftops across the capital.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of those monuments in Paris that could stay,\u201d said Laurent Bro\u00e9ze, a local architect pausing in the gardens on Thursday. \u201cIt was set up temporarily, but a bit like the Eiffel Tower, it makes sense for it to return. It\u2019s a bit of a shame they want to take it down later, but maybe it could be installed somewhere else, I don\u2019t know.\u201d",
      "Though it stole the show in 2024, the cauldron\u2019s original aluminum-and-balloon build was only meant to be temporary \u2014 not engineered for multiyear outdoor exposure.",

      "A\u00e9rophile, Paris\u2019s tethered balloon specialist, redesigned the winch and tether system to meet aviation rules, allowing safe operation in winds up to 20\u201325 kph (12-15 mph).",
      "Hydraulic, electrical, and misting systems were fortified \u2014 not only to ensure smooth nightly flights but to endure months of wear and tear untested on the original design. These retrofits shift the cauldron from a fragile, one-off spectacle to a resilient, summerlong landmark \u2014 prepared to withstand everything Paris summers can throw at it.",
      "The structure first dazzled during the Paris 2024 Games, ignited on July 26 by Olympic champions Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec and Teddy Riner. Over just 40 days, it drew more than 200,000 visitors, according to officials.",
      "Now perched in the center of the drained Tuileries pond, the cauldron\u2019s return is part of French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s effort to preserve the Games\u2019 spirit in the city, as Paris looks ahead to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles.",
      "Visitors have already begun to gather.",
      "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said Javier Smith, a tourist from Texas. \u201cAnd the place where it\u2019s going to be, or is sitting now, it\u2019s beautiful. All these beautiful buildings, the Louvre, all that is fantastic.\u201d",
      "Access is free and unticketed. The cauldron will be on display from morning to night, igniting with light from 10 a.m. and lifting off each evening after the garden closes \u2014 10:30 p.m. in June and July, with earlier times through September. It will float above the city for several hours before quietly descending around 1 a.m.",
      "The \u201cflame,\u201d while entirely electric, still conjures a sense of Olympic poetry.",
      "\u201cYes, we came for a little outing focused on the statues related to mythology in the Tuileries Garden,\u201d said Chlo\u00e9 Solana, a teacher visiting with her students. \u201cBut it\u2019s true we\u2019re also taking advantage of the opportunity, because last week the Olympic cauldron wasn\u2019t here yet, so it was really nice to be able to show it to the students.\u201d",
      "The cauldron\u2019s ascent may become a new rhythm of the Parisian summer, with special flights planned for Bastille Day on July 14 and the anniversary of the 2024 opening ceremony on July 26.",
      "It no longer carries the Olympic name. But this phoenix-like cauldron is still lifting Paris into the clouds \u2014 and into memory.",

      "House Republicans will look to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration seeks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk",
      "WASHINGTON -- House Republicans are moving to cut about $9.4 billion in spending already approved by Congress as President Donald Trump's administration looks to follow through on work by the Department of Government Efficiency when it was overseen by Elon Musk.",
      "The package to be voted on Thursday targets foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides money for National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service, as well as thousands of public radio and television stations around the country.",
      "Republicans are characterizing the spending as wasteful and unnecessary, but Democrats say the rescissions are hurting the United States' standing in the world.",
      "\u201cCruelty is the point,\u201d Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York said of the proposed spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is employing a tool rarely used in recent years that allows the president to transmit a request to Congress to cancel previously appropriated funds. That triggers a 45-day clock in which the funds are frozen pending congressional action. If Congress fails to act within that period, then the spending stands.",
      "The benefit for the administration of a formal rescissions request is that passage requires only a simple majority in the 100-member Senate instead of the 60 votes usually required to get spending bills through that chamber. So, if they stay united, Republicans will be able to pass the measure without any Democratic votes.",
      "The administration is likening the first rescissions package to a test case and says more could be on the way if Congress goes along.",
      "Republicans, sensitive to concerns that Trump's sweeping tax and immigration bill would increase future federal deficits, are anxious to demonstrate spending discipline, though the cuts in the package amount to just a sliver of the spending approved by Congress each year. They are betting the cuts prove popular with constituents who align with Trump's \u201cAmerica first\u201d ideology as well as those who view NPR and PBS as having a liberal bias.",
      "In all, the package contains 21 proposed rescissions. Approval would claw back about $900 million from $10 billion that Congress has approved for global health programs. That includes canceling $500 million for activities related to infectious diseases and child and maternal health and another $400 million to address the global HIV epidemic.",
      "The Trump administration is also looking to cancel $800 million, or a quarter of the amount Congress approved, for a program that provides emergency shelter, water and sanitation, and family reunification for those forced to flee their own country.",
      "About 45% of the savings sought by the White House would come from two programs designed to boost the economies, democratic institutions and civil societies in developing countries.",
      "The Republican president has also asked lawmakers to rescind nearly $1.1 billion from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which represents the full amount it\u2019s slated to receive during the next two budget years. About two-thirds of the money gets distributed to more than 1,500 locally owned public radio and television stations. Nearly half of those stations serve rural areas of the country.",
      "The association representing local public television stations warns that many of them would be forced to close if the Republican measure passes. Those stations provide emergency alerts, free educational programming and high school sports coverage and highlight hometown heroes.",
      "Advocacy groups that serve the world's poorest people are also sounding the alarm and urging lawmakers to vote no.",
      "\u201cWe are already seeing women, children and families left without food, clean water and critical services after earlier aid cuts, and aid organizations can barely keep up with rising needs,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president and CEO of Oxfam America, a poverty-fighting organization.",
      "Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said the foreign aid is a tool that prevents conflict and promotes stability but the measure before the House takes that tool away.",
      "\u201cThese cuts will lead to the deaths of hundreds of thousands, devastating the most vulnerable in the world,\u201d McGovern said. \u201cAnd at a time when China and Russia and Iran are working overtime to challenge American influence.\u201d",
      "Republicans disparaged the foreign aid spending and sought to link it to programs they said DOGE had uncovered.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, said taxpayer dollars had gone to such things as targeting climate change, promoting pottery classes and strengthening diversity, equity and inclusion programs. Other Republicans cited similar examples they said DOGE had revealed.",
      "\u201cYet, my friends on the other side of the aisle would like you to believe, seriously, that if you don't use your taxpayer dollars to fund this absurd list of projects and thousands of others I didn't even list, that somehow people will die and our global standing in the world will crumble,\u201d Roy said. \"Well, let's just reject this now.\u201d",

      "Sometimes death, as life, brings strange symmetries",
      "Sometimes there are strange symmetries in death, as in life. The twin passings of Sly Stone and Brian Wilson this week brought that into sharp relief.",
      "Both were musical geniuses who paid a high price for their gifts. They burned bright, with art they created at their peaks that became more moving and meaningful with time, only to see their creative lights extinguished suddenly through mental health and addiction issues. Both were 82 when they died \u2014 Stone on Monday and Wilson on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIt's such an unsettling coincidence,\u201d said Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. \u201cThese two figures, they were very different and massively influential, and each ran into a wall of their own problems in many ways. As much as they achieved, it's hard not to think that they could have done more.\u201d",
      "With his late brothers Carl and Dennis, Beach Boys co-founder Wilson was the architect of the California sound that captured surfing and sun, beaches and girls. Yet for all the \u201cFun, Fun, Fun,\u201d there was something much deeper and darker in Brian's abilities as a composer.",
      "It was more than disposable music for teen-agers. He had an unparalleled melodic sense, hearing sounds in his mind that others couldn't. He could worm his way into your head and then break your heart with songs like \u201cIn My Room\u201d and \u201cGod Only Knows.\u201d The tour de force \u201cGood Vibrations\u201d \u2014- had anyone ever heard of the theremin before he employed its unearthly wail? \u2014 is a symphony both complex and easily accessible.",
      "\u201cHe was our American Mozart,\u201d musician Sean Ono Lennon wrote on social media.",
      "The 1966 album \u201cPet Sounds\u201d was a peak. Wilson felt a keen sense of competition with the Beatles. But they had three writers, including Sean's dad, John Lennon. Wilson was largely alone, and he heard impatience and doubt from other Beach Boys, whose music he provided.",
      "He felt the pressure in trying to follow up \u201cPet Sounds,\u201d and \u201cSmile\u201d became music's most famous unfinished album. Wilson, a damaged soul to begin with because of an abusive father, never reached the heights again. He descended into a well-chronicled period of darkness.",
      "Stone's skills came in creating a musical world that others only dreamed of at the time. The Family Stone was an integrated world \u2014 Black and white, men and women \u2014 and the music they created was a potent mixture of rock, soul and funk. It made you move, it made you think.",
      "For a period of time from 1967 to 1973, their music was inescapable \u2014 \u201cDance to the Music,\u201d \u201cEverybody is a Star,\u201d \u201cHigher,\u201d \u201cHot Fun in the Summertime,\u201d \u201cSing a s Simple Song,\u201d \u201cFamily Affair,\u201d \u201cThank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin).\u201d Their performance at Woodstock was a milestone.",
      "\u201cHis songs weren't just about fighting injustice, they were about transforming the self to transform the world,\u201d musician and documentarian Questlove, who lovingly tended to Stone's legacy, wrote this week. \u201cHe dared to be simple in the most complex ways \u2014 using childlike joy, wordless cries and nursery rhyme cadences to express adult truths. His work looked straight at the brightest and darkest parts of life and demanded we do the same.\u201d",
      "From his peak, the fall was hard. Years of drug abuse took its toll. Periodic comeback attempts deepened a sense of bewilderment and pity.",
      "Music is littered with stories of sudden, untimely and early deaths. Yet until this week, both men lived on, somewhat improbably passing average life expectancies.",
      "Wilson, by many measures, achieved some level of peace late in life. He had a happy marriage. He was able to see how his music was revered and appreciated and spent several years performing it again with a younger band that clearly worshiped him. It was a postscript not many knew, said journalist Jason Fine, who befriended Wilson and made the 2021 documentary, \u201cBrian Wilson: Long Promised Road.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat sort of simple message he really wanted to give people through his music going back to the \u201860s \u2014 a sense of warmth, a sense that it\u2019s going to be OK in the same way that music lifted him up from his darkness, he'd try to do for other people,\u201d Fine told The Associated Press in an interview then. \u201cI think now, more than earlier in his career, he accepts that he does that and that's a great comfort to him.\u201d",
      "Stone emerged to write an autobiography in 2023. But less is known about his later years, whether he found peace or died without the full knowledge of what his music meant to others.",
      "\u201cYes, Sly battled addiction,\u201d Questlove wrote. \u201cYes, he disappeared from the spotlight. But he lived long enough to outlast many of his disciples, to feel the ripples of his genius return through hip-hop samples, documentaries and his memoir. Still, none of that replaces the raw beauty of his original work.\u201d",
      "Did Sly Stone and Brian Wilson live lives of tragedy or triumph? It's hard to say now. One suspects it will become easier with the passage of time, when only the work remains. That sometimes brings clarity.",
      "\u201cMillions of people had their lives changed by their music,\u201d DeCurtis said. \u201cNot just enjoyed it, but had their lives transformed. That's quite an accomplishment.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Tuesday made a brief trip to Montana, where he spoke to media mogul Rupert Murdoch; his son Lachlan Murdoch, the head of Fox News and News Corp.; and a group of other Fox News executives, according to two people familiar with the trip.",
      "Vance met with the group at the Murdoch family ranch in southwest Montana near Dillon, according to the people. They confirmed the visit to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the vice president addressed the group or what they spoke about.",
      "A spokesperson for Fox News Channel did not respond to a message seeking comment.",
      "The vice president's office does not release a schedule for Vance and did not offer advance notice of the trip, so the surprise arrival of Air Force Two in Butte, Montana, set off local speculation as his motorcade was seen driving away.",
      "The Murdoch ranch near Dillon is roughly 70 miles (110 kilometers) south of Butte. The ranch, which Murdoch purchased in 2021, is spread across two valleys and a mountain range and has some 12,000 cattle. It sits near Yellowstone National Park along the Montana-Idaho border.",
      "According to flight restrictions issued by the Federal Aviation Administration, the vice presidential aircraft was only on the ground for a matter of hours.",
      "Vance was scheduled to have lunch with President Donald Trump on Wednesday, according to the president's publicly released schedule, meaning the vice president presumably returned to Washington shortly after meeting the Murdochs 2,200 miles (3,500 kilometers) away on Tuesday night.",
      "Rupert Murdoch and his media organization have long been friendly with Republicans and have, for the most part, had a friendly relationship with Trump. He appeared at Trump's inauguration and was spotted earlier this year in the Oval Office.",
      "Rupert Murdoch, 94, stepped down as the head of Fox News and News Corp. in 2023 and handed control over to son Lachlan.",
      "Montana state Auditor James Brown told the Montana Talks radio show that he helped Vance\u2019s staff arrange the trip.",
      "Brown, who did not respond to a message Wednesday from the AP, said he met the vice president when Vance landed at the airport and then helped escort Vance\u2019s entourage on an hourlong drive by driving second lady Usha Vance\u2019s staff.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump is set to take a seat at Wednesday's opening night of the award-winning musical \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\" at the Kennedy Center, where he replaced the previous leadership with loyalists, had himself installed as chairman and pledged to rid the performing arts venue of programming he has complained is \u201cwoke\u201d and too focused on leftist ideology and political correctness.",
      "The Republican president's attendance at the sold-out showing of the Tony Award-winning tale of redemption in 19th century France comes as he has focused more than any recent predecessor on the arts center along the Potomac River that is a memorial to a slain Democratic president.",
      "Presidents' involvement in the Kennedy Center's affairs had been limited to naming members to the board of trustees and attending the taping of its annual honors program in the fall.",
      "But after returning to office in January, Trump stunned the arts world by firing the Kennedy Center's longtime director and board and replacing them with loyalists, who then named him as chairman, and promising to overhaul its programming, management and even appearance as part of an effort to put his stamp on the national arts scene.",
      "Trump's appearance in the Opera House on Wednesday, accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, will also mark his first time at a Kennedy Center performance as president. He avoided the venue after entertainment industry pushback to his policies in his first term in office, breaking with presidential tradition by never attending the annual Kennedy Center Honors taping.",
      "His moves have upset some of the center's patrons and performers.",
      "In March, the audience booed Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, after they slipped into upper-level seats in the Concert Hall to hear the National Symphony Orchestra. Trump appointed Usha Vance to the Kennedy Center board along with White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Fox News Channel hosts Maria Bartiromo and Laura Ingraham, among other supporters.",
      "Sales of subscription packages are said to have declined since Trump's takeover, and several touring productions, including \u201cHamilton,\u201d have canceled planned runs at the center. Artists such as actor Issa Rae and musician Rhiannon Giddens scrapped scheduled appearances, and Kennedy Center consultants including musician Ben Folds and singer Ren\u00e9e Fleming have resigned.",
      "Understudies may perform Wednesday night due to boycotts by \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d cast members.",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has adopted a more aggressive posture toward the arts. The White House has taken steps to cancel millions of dollars in previously awarded federal humanities grants to arts and culture groups, and Trump\u2019s budget blueprint proposed eliminating the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.",
      "Trump has also targeted Smithsonian museums by signing executive orders to restrict their funding and by attempting to fire the director of the National Portrait Gallery.",
      "Trump hosted the board at the White House for dinner in May and said congressional Republicans have pushed for more than $250 million for repairs and maintenance at the Kennedy Center. He claimed that \u201ctremendous amounts of money\u201d had been spent at the center but \u201cthey certainly didn't spend it on wallpaper, carpet or painting.\u201d",
      "He characterized previous programming as \u201cout of control with rampant political propaganda\u201d and said it featured \u201csome very inappropriate shows,\u201d including a \u201cMarxist anti-police performance\u201d and \u201cLesbian-only Shakespeare.\u201d",
      "Trump cited some drag show performances as a reason to take control of the center, though next season's theater lineup includes \u201dMrs. Doubtfire,\" which tells the story of a divorced man who disguises himself as a female nanny so he can spend time with his children.",
      "Trump also visited the Kennedy Center in March to preside over a board meeting and take a tour.",
      "The Kennedy Center, which is supported by government money and private donations, opened in 1971 and for decades has been seen as an apolitical celebration of the arts.",
      "It was first conceived in the late 1950s, during the administration of Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, who backed a bill from the Democratic-led Congress calling for a National Culture Center. In the early 1960s, Democratic President John F. Kennedy launched a fundraising initiative, and his successor, President Lyndon B. Johnson, signed into law a 1964 bill renaming the project the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts. Kennedy had been assassinated the year before.",

      "BERLIN -- German artist G\u00fcnther Uecker, one of the country's most important post-war artists who was world-famous for his large-format nail reliefs, has died. He was 95.",
      "German news agency dpa reported that his family confirmed he died at the university hospital in his hometown of D\u00fcsseldorf in western Germany Tuesday night. They did not give a cause of death.",
      "For decades, Uecker, who was often dubbed \u201cthe nail artist,\u201d created art by hammering carpenter\u2019s nails into chairs, pianos, sewing machines and canvases. His works can be found in museums and collections across the globe.",
      "In his art work, seemingly endless numbers of nails, which would by themselves perhaps be perceived as potentially aggressive and hurtful, turned into harmonic, almost organic creations. His reliefs with the tightly hewn nails are reminiscent of waving grasses or fields of algae in a marine landscape.",
      "Uecker himself described his nail art as diary-like landscapes of the soul, which he called an \u201cexpression of the poetic power of man,\u201d dpa reported.",
      "Hendrik W\u00fcst, the governor of North Rhine-Westphalia which includes state capital D\u00fcsseldorf, called Uecker \u201cone of the most important and influential artists in German post-war history\u201d and said that with his life\u2019s work, he influenced generations of young artists and \u201ccontributed to an open and dynamic society.\"",
      "Born on March 13, 1930, in the village of Wendorf on the Baltic Sea, Uecker moved to D\u00fcsseldorf in the mid-1950s, where he studied and later also taught at the city's prestigious art academy.",
      "In one of his most spectacular appearances or art happenings, he rode on the back of a camel through the hallways of the venerable academy in 1978. Together with fellow artist Gerhard Richter, he \u201coccupied\u201d the Kunsthalle Baden-Baden museum in 1968, with both kissing in front of the cameras.",
      "The son of a farmer, he traveled the world with a humanitarian message of peace and exhibited in countless countries, including dictatorships and totalitarian states. He painted ash pictures after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1986, and exhibited human rights messages painted on fabric in Beijing.",
      "He also painted \u201cVerletzungsw\u00f6rter,\u201d or words of violence, killing and torment in many languages and foreign scripts on large canvases. In 2023, Uecker erected a stone memorial in Weimar in memory of the victims of the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald.",
      "\u201cThe theme of my artistic work is the vulnerability of man by man,\u201d he said.",

      "Theo Jansen\u2019s wind-powered beach beasts have scuttled along the Dutch North Sea coast into a swanky Miami art show and even onto \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d",
      "DELFT, Netherlands -- The famous wind-powered beach beasts have scuttled along the Dutch North Sea coast, into a swanky Miami art show and even onto \u201cThe Simpsons.\u201d",
      "Now. they have a final resting place in a Dutch city most famous for \u201cGirl with a Pearl Earring\u201d painter Johannes Vermeer and blue-painted pottery.",
      "The \u201cbones\u201d of Theo Jansen\u2019s \u201cstrandbeesten\u201d \u2014 beach animals in Dutch \u2014 have taken over a former cable factory in Delft, the small city in the western Netherlands that Jansen has called home for decades.",
      "\u201cDuring the years, there has been a sort of evolutionary history, you could say. And you could see these animals as sort of natural historical objects,\u201d the 77-year old artist told The Associated Press before the installation\u2019s opening.",
      "The Strandbeesten Mortuary, as the exhibition is called, follows the various versions of the mobile sculptures since 1990 when Jansen created the first one from plastic pipes and tape. As the animals evolved, Jansen incorporated plastic bottles, wooden planks, cloth and cardboard.",
      "The life and death cycle of these famous animals \u2014 formed mostly out of PVC pipes \u2014 has left behind an impressive fossil record, which is on display at the exhibition.",
      "Marloes Koster, who organized the exhibition for Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof Museum, said that Jansen\u2019s ultimate goal is to create a beast that will live forever.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not there yet, so these are the ones that didn\u2019t make it,\u201d she added.",
      "The museum is undergoing major renovations, so Koster and her colleagues have been putting together arts and culture events at alternative venues around the city while the building is shut.",
      "Born near the North Sea, Jansen grew up captivated by the wind that often hits the Dutch coastline. He harnessed it to allow his animals to \u201cwalk\u201d along the beach. Every year, he creates a new strandbeest and, at the end of the summer, declares the animal dead.",
      "\u201cAll summer I do experiments, and in the fall I\u2019m a little bit wiser (about) how these animals should survive in the future,\u201d Jansen said.",
      "Many of the visitors to the opening of the exhibition had followed Jansen\u2019s work for years and were keen to understand how the strandbeesten had changed over time.",
      "\u201cYou see a kind of development in the way he does things. So they start out very simple, and then it gets increasingly complicated. So they evolve,\u201d said Cor Nonhof, a Delft local who had come to see the exhibition with his wife.",
      "Even at the opening, Jansen was already keen to return to the beach to work on the latest evolution of his strandbeesten.",
      "\u201cI cannot do anything else,\u201d Jansen said. \u201cAnd I am very happy with that.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In the heart of Spain\u2019s capital, the famous Sobrino de Bot\u00edn restaurant proudly holds the title of being the world\u2019s oldest restaurant",
      "MADRID -- In the heart of Spain's capital, Sobrino de Bot\u00edn holds a coveted Guinness World Record as the world's oldest restaurant. Exactly three hundred years after it opened its doors, Bot\u00edn welcomes droves of daily visitors hungry for Castilian fare with a side of history.",
      "But on the outskirts of Madrid, far from the souvenir shops and tourist sites, a rustic tavern named Casa Pedro makes a bold claim. Its owners assert the establishment endured not just the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s and the Napoleonic invasion in the early 1800s, but even the War of Spanish Succession at the start of the 18th century \u2014 a lineage that would make Casa Pedro older than Bot\u00edn and a strong contender for the title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really frustrating when you say, \u2018Yes, we\u2019ve been around since 1702,\u2019 but ... you can\u2019t prove it,\u201d said manager and eighth-generation proprietor Irene Gui\u00f1ales. \u201cIf you look at the restaurant\u2019s logo, it says \u2018Casa Pedro, since 1702,\u2019 so we said, \u2018Damn it, let\u2019s try to prove it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Gui\u00f1ales, 51, remembers her grandfather swearing by Casa Pedro\u2019s age, but she was aware that decades-old hearsay from a proud old-timer wouldn't be enough to prove it. Her family hired a historian and has so far turned up documents dating the restaurant's operations to at least 1750.",
      "That puts them within striking distance of Bot\u00edn\u2019s record.",
      "Both taverns are family-owned. Both offer Castilian classics like stewed tripe and roast suckling pig. They are decorated with charming Spanish tiles, feature ceilings with exposed wooden beams and underground wine cellars. And both enjoy a rich, star-studded history.",
      "Bot\u00edn's celebrated past includes a roster of literary patrons like Truman Capote, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Graham Greene. In his book \u201cThe Sun Also Rises,\u201d Ernest Hemingway described it as \u201cone of the best restaurants in the world.\" While Casa Pedro may not have boasted the same artistic pedigree, it boasts its own VIPs. Its walls are adorned with decades-old photographs of former Spanish King Juan Carlos I dining in one of its many rooms. The current Spanish monarch, King Felipe VI dines there, too, albeit more inconspicuously than his father.",
      "But the similarities between the two hotspots end there.",
      "Casa Pedro was once a stop on the only road heading north from the Spanish capital toward France. Its clientele is largely local regulars, like David Gonz\u00e1lez and Mayte Villena, who for years have spent every Friday lunching at the tavern.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn't change a thing for us,\u201d Villena said about the restaurant someday securing the Guinness title.",
      "Bot\u00edn, on the other hand, is a stone\u2019s throw from Madrid\u2019s famed Plaza Mayor, where any day of the week tour guides are herding groups around town \u2014 and often straight through the restaurant's front door.",
      "Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez, a third-generation proprietor of Bot\u00edn, concedes that the Guinness accolade awarded in 1987 has helped business, but said the restaurant had enough history to draw visitors even before.",
      "\u201cIt has a certain magic,\u201d he said.",
      "The question then becomes: How can either restaurant definitively claim the title? Guinness provides its specific guidelines for the superlative only to applicants, according to spokesperson Kylie Galloway, noting that it entails \u201csubstantial evidence and documentation of the restaurant\u2019s operation over the years.\"",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez said that Guinness required Bot\u00edn show that it has continuously operated in the same location with the same name.",
      "The only time the restaurant closed was during the COVID-19 pandemic, as did Casa Pedro.",
      "That criteria would mean that restaurants that are even older \u2014 Paris' Le Procope, which says it was founded in 1686, or Beijing\u2019s Bianyifang, founded in 1416, or the 1673-established White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island \u2014 aren't eligible for the designation.",
      "La Campana, in Rome\u2019s historic center, claims over 500 years of operation, citing documents on its menu and in a self-published history. Its owners say they have compiled the requisite paperwork and plan to submit it to Guinness.",
      "Gui\u00f1ales and her husband couldn't consult archives from the former town of Fuencarral, now a Madrid neighborhood. Those papers went up in flames during the Spanish Civil War. Instead, they delved into Spanish national archives, where they found land registries of the area from the First Marquess of Ensenada (1743-1754) that showed the existence of a tavern, wine cellar and inn in the small town as of 1750.",
      "In their spare time, the couple continues to hunt for records proving that Casa Pedro indeed dates back to 1702, as is proclaimed on its walls, takeout bags and sugar packets.",
      "But even if they dig up the final documents and wrest the Guinness honor from Bot\u00edn, Gui\u00f1ales concedes that her restaurant's quiet location makes it unlikely to draw Bot\u00edn\u2019s clientele in central Madrid.",
      "\u201cTo think that we could reach that public would be incredible,\u201d Gui\u00f1ales said. \u201cIt's a dream, but it's a dream.\u201d",

      "Jung Kook thanked the journalists and fans who traveled to see him and Jimin after their discharge and acknowledged how different it was to be back in the spotlight. \u201cActually, it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been in front of cameras, and I didn\u2019t even put on makeup, so I\u2019m a bit embarrassed,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say.\u201d",
      "The pair enlisted in December 2023, one day after RM and V did the same. The latter were discharged on Tuesday.",
      "Supporters traveled from around the world to the public sports ground where the meet-and-greet took place. It was moved from the military base\u2019s gate for safety reasons. Color-wrapped buses bearing BTS members\u2019 faces lined the streets while red and yellow balloons floated above and a decorated food truck provided free coffee and water, adding to the festive atmosphere.",
      "Many supporters wore masks, conscious of potential backlash after the band\u2019s label discouraged attendance citing safety concerns. Despite the challenges, fans like Anaesi from Portugal said the 20-hour journey to Yeoncheon, a town near the tense border with North Korea, was worth it.",
      "\u201cPortugal is a small country, but inside of Portugal, BTS is a king,\u201d she said. Anaesi, who discovered BTS on YouTube, said the group \u201csaved\u201d her from depression. \u201cSo for me BTS is my angel,\u201d she said. She displayed a colorful upper arm tattoo featuring a golden shield emblazoned with \u201cARMY\u201d and an eagle above it, complemented by Korean text listing BTS members\u2019 names and those of her friends.",
      "V thanked fans Tuesday for their patience in waiting for him and RM's return and teased the band's reunion. \"If you can just wait a little bit longer, we will return with a really amazing performance.\u201d",
      "The seven singers of the popular K-pop band plan to reunite as a group sometime in 2025 after they finish their service.",
      "Six of the group\u2019s seven members served in the army, while Suga is fulfilling his duty as a social service agent, an alternative form of military service. He will be discharged later this month.",
      "Jin, the oldest BTS member, was discharged in June 2024. J-Hope was discharged in October.",
      "In South Korea, all able-bodied men aged 18 to 28 are required by law to perform 18-21 months of military service under a conscription system meant to deter aggression from rival North Korea.",
      "The law gives special exemptions to athletes, classical and traditional musicians, and ballet and other dancers if they have obtained top prizes in certain competitions and are assessed to have enhanced national prestige. K-pop stars and other entertainers aren\u2019t subject to such privileges.",
      "However, in 2020, BTS postponed their service until age 30 after South Korea\u2019s National Assembly revised its Military Service Act, allowing K-pop stars to delay their enlistment until age 30.",
      "There was heated public debate in 2022 over whether to offer special exemptions of mandatory military service for BTS members, until the group\u2019s management agency announced in October 2022 that all seven members would fulfill their duties.",

      "The abortion funding system across the U.S. is battered three years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and allowed states to enforce bans.",
      "An initial surge of donations has subsided, scores of clinics have closed and advocates fear that federal policy changes will result in more shutting down.",
      "\u201cWe're all collectively struggling,\u201d said Ramsie Monk, director of development at the Women's Health Centers of West Virginia and Maryland, which opened a clinic in 2023 in western Maryland after abortion was banned in West Virginia.",
      "\u201cI honestly don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a sustainable model,\u201d said Mercedes Sanchez, executive director at the Cedar River Clinics in Washington. \u201cClinics, providers, funds are all very committed to making sure people can access care, but it is definitely going to be more of a challenge.\u201d",
      "Bans in some states mean travel has become a bigger part of obtaining an abortion, bring a host of costs.",
      "A mitigating factor is that most abortions are now done with medications. They can be prescribed by telehealth, including to women in states where abortion is banned. But they can't be used in every case, some women prefer procedures, and there are challenges to the legality of pills and how they're prescribed.",
      "Not all private insurance plans cover abortions. Federal taxpayer funds cannot be used for abortions, but state Medicaid funds cover them in some places. And a network of private funding helps cover procedures or travel and other costs.",
      "The increase in contributions that followed the 2022 Supreme Court ruling has declined for most funds and clinics. \u201cThe resources have not kept pace with demand continuing to surge,\u201d Lynn McCann-Yeh, co-executive director of the Baltimore Abortion Fund.",
      "With bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy now being enforced in 12 states and bans at about six weeks' gestation being enforced in four others, travel for abortion has become more frequent. Costs for each trip can include plane tickets or gas for long drives, meals, hotels and child care \u2014 all on top of clinic fees.",
      "Last year, the National Abortion Federation's hotline fund reduced the portion of clinic costs it covers for people with financial needs to 30% from 50% so it could help more people as demand increased. The group's says travel costs now average over $1,000 per person.",
      "Travel needs have made the job for abortion funds not only more expensive but more intricate.",
      "Before the Texas ban started in 2021, Fund Texas Choice got about 40 calls a month, executive director Anna Rupani said. Now, it's over 200. And assisting each caller can take more time because they involve arranging flights and hotels, not just lining up rides to clinics in the state.",
      "Some people cobble together money from a hodgepodge of groups to pay for an abortion. Grace McGarry, who manages the phone line for Whole Woman's Health, which operates five clinics across the U.S., said he talked to a patient who was getting aid from nine different groups.",
      "Since the Supreme Court's ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, I Need An A, which operates a website dedicated to providing information about abortion options, has tallied 105 clinics closing.",
      "Twenty-nine closures were in states where abortion is now banned at all stages of pregnancy. Eleven were in states where it's banned at about six weeks' gestation, before many women realize they're pregnant. But 65 of the closures were in other states.",
      "At the same time, 34 clinics have opened anew or moved to states where abortion is legal.",
      "\u201cEach and every one of those has been a blow to that community that hasn\u2019t been refilled,\u201d said Rebecca Nall, the founder of I Need An A.",
      "Planned Parenthood North Central States announced in May that it would close eight locations in Iowa and Minnesota while expanding services at some other clinics.",
      "Ruth Richardson, the CEO of that Planned Parenthood affiliate, said the reorganization recognizes that the number of abortions in Iowa plummeted after the state started enforcing its strict abortion law. It also reflects that the regional group's overall budget is down.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got the compounded challenges of the fact that sexual and reproductive health care has been politicized in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of SBA Pro-Life America, said in a statement that the closures are warranted: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s focus is squarely on abortions, gender transitions and political spending.\u201d",
      "In March, the Department of Health and Human Services withheld $27.5 million that groups were expecting to provide family planning, contraception, cancer screening and sexually transmitted infection tests and treatment. Some of the groups also provide abortions and include at least 11 regional Planned Parenthood affiliates.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re absolutely in a public health crisis of epic proportions,\u201d said Brittany Fonteno, president and CEO of the National Abortion Federation. \"We\u2019re in a situation where there are reproductive health care deserts, not just abortion care deserts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump's tax and budget bill that is up for consideration in the Senate after getting House approval would deliver more blows to abortion funding.",
      "It would bar federally subsidized health insurance plans from covering abortion, except if it's necessary to save the life of the woman, or in cases of rape or incest.",
      "The bill also would bar Medicaid funds from flowing to Planned Parenthood, the nation's biggest abortion provider.",
      "Planned Parenthood said those provisions could lead to the closures of about half its clinics that provide abortion \u2014- and about one-fourth of abortion clinics nationwide. The biggest impact on affiliate clinics would be in states where abortion is legal.",

      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients has lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers",
      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A former Ohio doctor who was fired before being found not guilty on murder charges in the deaths of 14 patients lost a defamation lawsuit against his former employers on Monday, after a judge stepped in for a jury on grounds the evidence presented by the defendants was incontrovertible.",
      "Franklin County Judge Stephen McIntosh issued his directed verdict against former doctor William Husel, whose attorneys accused Michigan-based Trinity Health and Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus of orchestrating a campaign to destroy his reputation.",
      "Husel was seeking more than $18 million from the health care companies.",
      "His attorney, David Vermillion, said in a statement that Husel's legal team was disappointed that McIntosh would prevent the jury from making a decision in the case after weeks of evidence and testimony had been presented. He said issuing the directed verdict, a procedural move requested by the hospital, \u201ceffectively silences the voices of those who came seeking justice.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the outcome that any reasonable person expected, nor is it one that reflects the strength of the evidence presented,\" he said. \u201cWe are evaluating all legal options, including appeal. This case has always been about more than one courtroom or one ruling. It is about truth, accountability, and the right of every individual to defend their name against false and damaging accusations.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel issued a statement that said simply, \u201cWe are pleased with the judge\u2019s decision.\u201d",
      "Mount Carmel Health System fired the doctor in 2018 after it concluded he had ordered excessive painkillers for about three dozen patients who died over several years.",
      "He initially was charged with murder in 25 deaths in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. Eleven counts were dismissed before trial.",
      "Husel, now 49, maintained he was trying to help patients deal with their pain, sometimes in the last moments of their life, not speed up their deaths. Despite being found not guilty by a jury on murder charges in 2022, he permanently surrendered his medical license.",
      "He filed multiple lawsuits against his former employer, accusing Trinity Health and Mount Carmel of defamation and malicious prosecution.",
      "As part of the defamation lawsuit filed in 2019, Husel\u2019s attorneys said Trinity Health repeatedly spread lies and false information to convince the public and law enforcement that Husel was a killer, even though health system officials knew that was not true.",
      "\u201cObviously, these false allegations destroyed Dr. Husel\u2019s life,\u201d the lawsuit said. Husel gave up his medical license because his lawyers said that he knew the damage to his reputation would prevent him from working as a doctor.",
      "In court documents filed two years ago, Husel said he had been unable to find work and was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.",
      "Trinity Health had asked a judge to toss the lawsuit, but a Franklin County judge ruled there was enough reason to move forward.",
      "Husel, who worked in the intensive care unit, was charged in cases that involved the use of at least 500 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl. Prosecutors said ordering such dosages for nonsurgical situations indicated an intent to end lives.",
      "His colleagues who administered the medications at Mount Carmel West Hospital in Columbus weren\u2019t criminally charged, but the hospital said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation and referred various employees to their respective state boards for disciplinary action.",
      "The hospital reached settlements in multiple cases involving relatives of the patients who died.",

      "Midway up the Appalachian Trail, a little country store in Gardners, Pennsylvania, invites hikers to take on an additional challenge: eating a half-gallon of ice cream in one sitting",
      "GARDNERS, Pa. -- Sam Cooper had just trekked 7 miles (11 kilometers) through a rain-sodden stretch of the Appalachian Trail when he sat down outside a little country store in Pennsylvania to take on its ice cream challenge.",
      "Nearly 40 minutes and 2,500 calories later, the dairy farmer from Chapel Hill, Tennessee, was polishing off the final titanium sporkful of chocolate chip cookie dough on Tuesday and adding his name to the list of \u201cthru-hikers\u201d who have celebrated the trail's halfway point by downing a half-gallon of ice cream.",
      "By the end Cooper, 32, whose trail name is Pie Top, was calling the experience \u201cpure misery.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don't think anybody should be doing this,\u201d Cooper said cheerfully. \u201cThis is not healthy at all.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge is thought to have begun more than four decades ago at the Pine Grove Furnace General Store in Gardners, a few miles north of the current true halfway point on the 2,197-mile (3,536-kilometer) trail. Thru-hikers, as they're known, are the fraction of the trail's 3 million annual visitors who attempt to walk its entire length in a single, continuous trip.",
      "As they slog their way north through Virginia and Maryland, the ice cream challenge is a regular topic of conversation among thru-hikers at shelters and campfires, said Stephan Berens, 49, a psychiatric nurse from Nuremberg, Germany.",
      "Berens, whose trail name is Speedy, polished off his black cherry and vanilla in about 25 minutes after completing 17 miles (27 kilometers) on the trail that day \u2014 and with seven (11 kilometers) more to go that afternoon.",
      "Trail experts say hikers can need up to 6,000 calories a day, a practical challenge when food needs to be carried up and down rocky terrain. The slender Berens figures he's lost about 20 pounds (9 kilograms) since starting April 8.",
      "\u201cI thought it would be worse, but it's OK,\u201d said Berens, smiling and patting his stomach after finishing the half-gallon. \u201cSuch a crazy idea.\u201d",
      "Zeke Meddock, trail name Petroglyph, didn't bother timing himself but finished his choice of a quart and a half carton of chocolate chip cookie dough and a pint of strawberry. The diesel mechanic from North Amarillo, Texas, began his hike on March 27, two months after finishing a stint in the U.S. Army.",
      "\u201cYou're basically walking away from life,\u201d said Meddock, 31. \u201cIt's the most free I've ever felt.\u201d",
      "So far this year, about 50 thru-hikers have finished the challenge, earning the honor of having their photos posted on a store bulletin board. In a notebook to record their thoughts, Chicken Louise wrote on May 24: \u201cLife choices?\u201d The next day, Seagull weighed in with, \u201cI feel bad,\" and Hyena issued a cry for help: \u201cIt was very fun for the first 15 minutes. Now, I (and my family) want to die.\u201d",
      "The ice cream challenge record, less than 4 minutes, was set two years ago by a man with the trail name Squirt. Two decades ago, the mark to beat was about 9 minutes.",
      "Thru-hikers who want to attempt the record may only allow the $12 worth of ice cream to start to melt in the sun for a few minutes. They must be timed by a store employee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s called the half-gallon challenge,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cVery appropriately named.\u201d",
      "Bruce Thomas, a 41-year-old disability support worker from Medicine Hat in Alberta, Canada, passed on the ice cream challenge, opting instead for a breakfast sandwich and another one for the road.",
      "\u201cIt's early morning and I'm pretty sure I cannot do it,\u201d said Thomas, trail name Not Lazy.",
      "Those who do finish in a single sitting are awarded a commemorative wooden spoon \u2014 and bragging rights for the rest of their hike. Some people get sick. Others wash down the ice cream with a hamburger.",
      "The ice cream challenge is one of several quirky traditions and places along the trail. There\u2019s a shelter in Virginia where hikers confess their sins in a logbook, a two-hole outhouse in Maine with a cribbage board between the seats and a free canoe ferry across the Kennebec River that\u2019s considered an official part of the trail. And at Harriman State Park in Tuxedo, New York, hikers encounter the renowned \u201cLemon Squeezer,\u201d a narrow rock formation.",
      "About one in three people who launch a thru hike take the roughly 5 million steps required to go the distance. They most often walk from south to north, starting in Springer Mountain, Georgia, and wrapping up 13 states later at Maine's Mount Katahdin.",
      "The trek typically takes six months but the current speed record is about 40 days, according to the Appalachian Trail Conservancy. Meddock said there's talk that a man on the trail behind him may be on pace to break it.",
      "There's also been a lot of discussion among hikers about the extensive damage along the trail in southern states from September's Hurricane Helene. But mostly they think and talk about walking.",
      "\u201cIt's always hard,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cIt's going to be hard. I never think about quitting. I only think about how I can do it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- As Republican senators consider President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill that could slash federal spending and extend tax cuts, a new survey shows most U.S. adults don\u2019t think the government is overspending on the programs the GOP has focused on cutting, like Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. They're more divided on spending around the military and border security, and most think the government is spending too much on foreign aid.",
      "The poll points to a disconnect between Republicans\u2019 policy agenda and public sentiment around the domestic programs that are up for debate in the coming weeks.",
      "Here\u2019s the latest polling data on how Americans view federal funding:",
      "Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded \u2014 even as Congress proposes significant cuts to Medicaid and food and nutrition assistance programs \u2014 and few say \u201ctoo much\u201d money is going to these programs.",
      "About half of U.S. adults say \u201ctoo little\u201d funding goes to Medicaid, which is a government health care coverage program for low-income people and people with certain disabilities. Nearly half, 45%, say food and nutrition assistance programs like food stamps, SNAP or EBT cards are underfunded, according to the poll. About 3 in 10 U.S. adults in each case say those programs are receiving \u201cabout the right amount\u201d of funding, indicating that most Americans likely do not want to see significant cuts to the two programs.",
      "About 2 in 10 say Medicaid is overfunded, while about one-quarter say that about food assistance programs.",
      "Republicans are especially likely to say \u201ctoo much\u201d is spent on food and nutrition assistance programs when compared with Democrats and independents \u2014 46% of Republicans say this, compared with about 1 in 10 Democrats and independents.",
      "When it comes to Medicaid, fewer Republicans, about one-third, say the government is spending \u201ctoo much.\u201d",
      "About 6 in 10 Americans say there is not enough government money going toward Social Security, Medicare or education broadly. But Democrats overwhelmingly think \u201ctoo little\u201d money is allocated to these areas, while Republicans are happier with the status quo.",
      "Very few think Medicare, Social Security and education are getting \u201ctoo much\u201d funding. Only about 1 in 10 Republicans say this about either Medicare or Social Security. Roughly one-quarter of Republicans say too much is spent on education.",
      "When it comes to Social Security, about half of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is spent, compared with about 7 in 10 Democrats.",
      "Americans are more divided on whether the government is devoting too much money to the military or border security.",
      "About 3 in 10 say the government is spending \u201ctoo much\u201d on the military, while a similar share say the government is spending \u201ctoo little.\u201d Close to 4 in 10 say the government is spending \u201cabout the right amount.\u201d",
      "Republicans are much less likely to say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent on border security than they were before Trump took office again in January. Now, 45% of Republicans say \u201ctoo little\u201d is being spent, down from 79% in a January AP-NORC poll.",
      "On the other hand, Democrats are more likely to say that \u201ctoo much\u201d is being spent on border security. About half of Democrats now say this, compared with about 3 in 10 in January.",
      "The Trump administration has asked Congress for deep reductions to foreign aid programs, including cuts to global health programs and refugee resettlement initiatives.",
      "Foreign aid is one area with more general agreement that there is \u201ctoo much\u201d federal spending. Most U.S. adults, 56%, say the U.S. government is spending too much on assistance to other countries, which is down from 69% in an AP-NORC poll from March 2023.",

      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill announced Thursday she is investigating whether pharmaceutical giant CVS improperly used customers' personal information to send out text messages lobbying against a proposed state law.",
      "Murrill also said she plans to issue a cease-and-desist letter to the company to stop the messages.",
      "As lawmakers debated a now-failed bill on Wednesday they held up screenshots of text messages sent by CVS.",
      "\u201cLast minute legislation in Louisiana threatens to close your CVS Pharmacy \u2014 your medication cost may go up and your pharmacist may lose their job,\u201d one such text, obtained by The Associated Press, read.",
      "The proposed legislation would have prohibited companies from owning both pharmacy benefit managers and drug stores.",
      "The CVS Health Corporation owns retail pharmacies as well as CVS Caremark, one the country\u2019s top three pharmacy benefit managers with a market share of more than 100 million members. CVS Caremark and other managers serve as middlemen purchasing prescription drugs from manufacturers and setting the terms for how they are distributed to customers.",
      "\u201cThese powerful middlemen may be profiting by inflating drug costs and squeezing Main Street pharmacies,\u201d a 2024 Federal Trade Commission report warned.",
      "CVS says on its website that it \u201cnegotiates lower costs for our customers and expands coverage to affordable medications that people need to stay healthy.\u201d",
      "The company's text messages to Louisiana residents included a link to a draft letter urging lawmakers to oppose the legislation that someone could sign with their email address and send to legislators.",
      "\u201cThe proposed legislation would take away my and other Louisiana patients\u2019 ability to get our medications shipped right to our homes,\u201d the letter read. \u201cThey would also ban the pharmacies that serve patients suffering from complex diseases requiring specialty pharmacy care to manage their life-threatening conditions like organ transplants or cancer. These vulnerable patients cannot afford any disruption to their care \u2013 the consequences would be dire.\u201d",
      "Rep. Dixon McMakin pointed to some of the messages from CVS, saying they were misleading and false. He specifically pointed to ads, that people reported seeing on social media, alleging that lawmakers \u201cmay shut down every CVS pharmacy in the state.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo we\u2019re not, you liars. Quit being liars. Quit using scare tactics,\u201d McMakin said.",

      "\u201cIt's in the same text thread (used) to notify when my prescription is filled,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve now taken that to send me political texts.\u201d",
      "CVS sent messages to \u201clarge numbers\" of state employees and their families to lobby against proposed legislation involving the company's pharmaceutical benefits manager, Murrill said in an X post.",
      "Customers gave CVS their phone numbers to receive pharmaceutical information such as vaccine availability or prescription pick-ups but the company is using this personal information \u201cfor their own personal corporate interests against pending legislation,\u201d Murrill told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s not why anybody gave them their phone number.\u201d",
      "Amy Thibault, a spokesperson for CVS, said the texts were the result of a last-minute amendment to the bill Wednesday without an opportunity for a public hearing.",
      "The amendment was crafted behind closed-doors by a conference committee \u2014 a regular practice utilized in the statehouse when the House and Senate cannot agree on final versions of a bill.",
      "\u201cWe believe we have a responsibility to inform our customers of misguided legislation that seeks to shutter their trusted pharmacy, and we acted accordingly,\u201d Thibault said in an email. \u201cOur communication with our customers, patients and members of our community is consistent with law.\u201d",
      "Republican Gov. Jeff Landry has continued to push the bill as the state's legislature concluded Thursday afternoon.",
      "The bill, which proponents said would bolster independent pharmacies and reduce the cost of prescription medications, received overwhelming approval in the House, with a vote of 88-4.",
      "Among those who voted against the measure was Rep. Mandie Landry. The Democrat said that while she wanted to vote in favor, but she was receiving messages from people in her district urging her not to. She said CVS's lobbying had reached them and as a result they feared that they wouldn't be able to access their medications.",
      "\u201cCVS \u2026 you should be so ashamed of this. You are scaring people,\u201d Landry said.",

      "A growing number of Black fathers with autistic children are looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience",
      "ATLANTA -- When Tyrone Green's youngest son was diagnosed with autism, his wife was immediately ready to get the 3-year-old the support he needed. But Green was stuck: He had questions about his son\u2019s future and an overwhelming feeling of loneliness \u2014 like no one, not his wife, not his friends, understood his experience.",
      "\u201c ... (M)y wife couldn\u2019t understand what I was going through as a Black father, all these hopes and dreams I had for my kid,\" said Green, who lives in Michigan. \u201cShe didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d",
      "In 2021, he joined a Black fathers' support group and met a few other dads eager to discuss their unique challenges. They started their own podcast in 2023 called AutisHIM, a place where Black dads talk about the wins and setbacks of having autistic children.",
      "Green is among a growing number of Black fathers of autistic children looking to be more visible in the national autism conversation through podcasts, nonprofits and summits that specifically address their experience. These men say that their hope is not only to be considered more than sidekicks to mothers of the children, but also to help other Black dads accept autism diagnoses and not prolong getting kids the help that they need.",
      "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects how people communicate, process information and interact with the world around them. Federal data shows that since 2020, Black children have had a higher prevalence of autism spectrum disorder than white children \u2014 a change experts credit mostly to better awareness of autism in underserved communities.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. recently announced plans to have the federal government do a broad study for the causes of autism, even though it\u2019s been looked at by researchers for decades. He has said autism is a \u201ctragedy\u201d that \u201cdestroys families\u201d and that some people with autism will never hold a job, pay taxes or go on dates.",
      "But many people with autism live successful, socially rich and independent lives, which makes a narrative like Kennedy's dangerous, said Michael Hannon, a counseling professor at Montclair State University who studies the social and emotional aspects of autism on Black fatherhood.",
      "It \u201ccan literally diminish hope for any father or father figure or family,\u201d Hannon said of Kennedy's framing of autism.",
      "But affinity groups for Black men who have kids with autism are a successful way to get the dads to engage with their emotions, Hannon said.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is convincing people to (talk openly and honestly), because the practice of doing that is rare, not just among Black men, but people in general,\u201d he said, adding that people might think it will reflect on their ability to parent.",
      "Evan Polk said a big part of navigating his 13-year-old daughter\u2019s diagnosis was learning to sit with emotions that weren't simply \u201chappy and mad.\u201d In the beginning, he was very protective.",
      "\u201cI became a helicopter dad,\u201d said Polk, who started AuSome Kicks, an art therapy nonprofit for autistic children near Philadelphia earlier this year. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nobody or nothing to harm her whatsoever. When I found out she was autistic, she\u2019d be outside with knee pads and elbow pads looking crazy.\u201d",
      "He said he later taught his family to be more patient with his daughter, as opposed to traditional parenting styles of being firm and hoping that she would fall in line.",
      "Dr. Berry Pierre said he initially was on the sidelines of his autistic daughter's support team as his wife, Maria Davis-Pierre, did the bulk of advocating.",
      "The Florida couple founded Autism in Black and for the first five years, he said the organization didn't specifically tailor messaging to Black dads.",
      "\u201cWhether it be in schools, the (individual education plan) meetings, the mothers were just there.\u201d Pierre said. \u201cBut as we started to kind of try to go deeper and figure out \u2018Alright, what\u2019s going on? Where are the guys?\u2019 we started to realize that a lot of them will be there.\u201d",
      "Many Black dads, Pierre found out, were equally involved as the moms, and Pierre wanted to get more of them talking publicly about autism.",
      "\u201cThe dads are there, but we know the general public doesn't realize that yet,\u201d Pierre said. \u201cSo we try to serve as this engine to shine a light on what's really happening. The dads are there, they're attentive. And even with this diagnosis, they're going even harder.\u201d",
      "Some dads, like Nicholas Love in North Carolina, said they first hesitated to openly share their journey of raising their kids with autism in fear that people may not understand.",
      "\u201cI was very guarded for a while in talking about my children both being on the spectrum,\u201d said Love, who is CEO of the marketing agency The Kulur Group. \u201cEven in how you take pictures that you upload on social media, being cognizant and thinking about, \u2019Well is this a picture that looks, dare I say, the perception of what normal looks like?'\"",
      "Now, he's an open book about them, is understanding when employees need a little extra time for urgent family needs and has advocated that men receive more paid leave so they will have time to be more involved with their kids.",
      "\u201cI got to a point where it\u2019s like, \u201cOK, this is my reality \u2026 I need to do my part in normalizing this,\" Love said.",
      "Green said that while his podcast and platforms like Autism in Black make it easier for Black fathers to share their stories of their kids' wins and losses, he'd like to see \u201cmore support groups out there, more podcasts, more conversations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see a lot of Black women doing their thing and I highly appreciate that, but I think there definitely needs to be more conversations surrounding (Black fatherhood and autism) because, for myself, I\u2019m a Black man,\" Green said. \"I have a Black family, but this is never really the topic of discussion.\u201d",

      "Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias has asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department for allegedly sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- The Illinois secretary of state on Thursday asked for an investigation into a suburban Chicago police department after learning that it violated state law by sharing data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion.",
      "Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias asked the attorney general to review the matter. He also is creating an audit system to ensure police departments don't run afoul of a 2023 law banning the distribution of license-plate data to track women seeking abortions or to find undocumented immigrants.",
      "The incident underscores the fears that led to the law: In particular, that states which restricted abortion access after Roe v. Wade was overturned would use the technology to follow and possibly prosecute women seeking the procedure by crossing into Illinois, where it is readily available.",
      "\u201cLicense plate readers can serve as an important tool for law enforcement, but these cameras must be regulated so they aren\u2019t abused for surveillance, tracking the data of innocent people or criminalizing lawful behavior,\u201d the Democrat said in a statement.",
      "According to Giannoulias, police in Mount Prospect, 24 miles (39 kilometers) northwest of Chicago, shared license-plate data with the sheriff in Johnson County, Texas, who was looking for a woman whose family was worried because she had undergone a self-administered abortion.",
      "Giannoulias says Mount Prospect also shared data outside of Illinois on undocumented immigrants, in violation of the law. Between mid-January and April, there were 262 searches on immigration-related matters in Mount Prospect alone, he said.",
      "Telephone and email messages were left for Mount Prospect Police Chief Michael Eterno. Violations by Mount Prospect could result in loss of state funding, deputy Secretary of State Scott Burnham said.",
      "The incident was revealed by a website called 404 Media, which reported that the Texas sheriff sent a nationwide request for data from 83,000 cameras operated by the private company Flock Safety, including those in Mount Prospect.",
      "At Giannoulias\u2019 request, Flock Safety blocked access to 62 out-of-state agencies that have sought data related to abortion or immigration, Burnham said. The company also set up a program to flag the terms \u201cabortion\u201d and \u201cimmigration\u201d in requests for access and deny those requests.",
      "Police agencies will also be required to comply with audits by the secretary of state to mark trends or upticks in certain requests, Burnham said.",
      "The Flock Safety cameras take photos of passing license plates thousands of times a day. The technology, called Automatic License Plate Recognition, is helpful in tracking stolen vehicles or carjackings, missing persons and in other authorized cases.",
      "The technology allows police agencies to read thousands of license plates per minute from images captured by cameras along roadways.",
      "After Roe v. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, was overturned in 2022, Giannoulias was behind Illinois' first-in-the-nation law that requires other states wanting access to Illinois license-plate data to agree not to use it for that purpose or to track undocumented immigrants.",

      "The girl's family says that her Minnesota school district didn\u2019t do enough to make sure she has the accommodations she needs to learn, including failing to provide adequate instruction in the evening when her seizures are less frequent.",
      "But lower courts ruled against the family's discrimination claims in court, despite finding the school had fallen short. That\u2019s because courts in that part of the country require plaintiffs in lawsuits against schools to show officials used \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d a higher legal standard than most disability discrimination claims.",
      "The family appealed to the Supreme Court. The district, Osseo Area Schools, said that lowering the legal standard could expose the country\u2019s understaffed public schools to more lawsuits if their efforts fall short, even if officials are working in good faith.",
      "The district also argued that all claims over accommodations for people with disabilities should be held to the same higher standard \u2014 a potentially major switch that would have been a \u201cfive-alarm fire\u201d for the disability rights community, the girl's lawyers said.",

      "Every month, thousands of women thwart abortion bans in their home states by turning to telehealth clinics willing to prescribe pregnancy-ending drugs online and ship them anywhere in the country.",
      "Whether this is legal, though, is a matter of debate. Two legal cases involving a New York doctor could wind up testing the shield laws some states have passed to protect telehealth providers who ship abortion pills nationwide.",
      "Dr. Margaret Carpenter faces a felony charge in Louisiana for supplying abortion medication through the mail to a pregnant teen in that state. The patient's mother also faces criminal charges. A Texas judge fined the same physician $100,000 after the state accused her of prescribing abortion medication for a woman near Dallas.",
      "So far, the prosecution hasn't progressed thanks to New York's shield law, which has protected Carpenter from extradition to Louisiana. But other telehealth centers operating in states with similar legal protections for abortion providers are watching closely.",
      "\"We have great legal counsel who have advised us that what we are doing is legal,\u201d said Dr. Angel Foster, co-founder of The Massachusetts Medication Abortion Access Project, which is among a handful of telehealth providers that facilitate abortions from afar in states with bans.",
      "As more states consider enacting shield laws or expanding existing ones, whether one state can shield providers from liability for breaking another state's laws around abortion is still an unsettled area of law.",
      "Erik Baptist, senior counsel for the Alliance Defending Freedom, which opposes abortion, said shield laws violate a constitutional requirement that states respect the laws and legal judgments of other states.",
      "\"What these shield law states are doing are undermining the prerogative of these pro-life states to implement and enforce pro-life laws,\u201d said Baptist, director of the group\u2019s Center for Life. \u201dAnd so I think the Supreme Court ultimately will want to take this.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is inherently a challenge with shield laws and telehealth,\u201d said Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School. \u201cAt a certain point, for the purposes of abortion bans, the courts will need to decide: Do we treat a telehealth abortion as happening within the state of the provider or within the state of the patient?\u201d",
      "Decades ago, the FDA approved the use of two prescription medicines \u2014 mifepristone and misoprostol \u2014 to terminate pregnancies.",

      "The Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion rights, said that between April and June 2024 there were an average of 7,700 telehealth abortions performed each month in states that either ban abortion totally or after six weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The prescribing process at telehealth clinics varies by provider, but usually takes place entirely online, with the patient answering a series of health-related questions and consent forms.",
      "At some telehealth clinics, medical providers don't come face-to-face with patients, even via videoconferencing, and patients don't necessarily know the prescriber's name unless requested.",
      "For instance, when Foster's clinic, also known as The MAP, puts pills in the mail, only the name of the practice appears on the label, as allowed under the Massachusetts shield law. If patients have follow-up questions, they can talk or text the doctor working that day, but may not know that doctor's name either.",

      "\u201cThis has been the safety net, post-Dobbs, of allowing people who don\u2019t have the ability to travel out of state to get abortion care,\u201d said Greer Donley, a University of Pittsburgh law professor and abortion law expert.",
      "When dealing with medications not related to abortion, doctors are often able to write prescriptions for patients in other states. However, in most states, if the patient is located within its borders, the doctor must have a license issued by that state, according to Mei Wa Kwong, executive director of the The Center for Connected Health Policy.",
      "Twenty three states and Washington, D.C., currently have shield laws protecting abortion providers.",
      "Of those, eight have specific provisions protecting them from criminal prosecution or civil lawsuits even if the patient is in another state, according to the nonprofit research organization KFF. They include California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.",
      "Louisiana\u2019s request to extradite Carpenter hit a roadblock when New York Gov. Kathy Hochul rejected it, citing the state\u2019s shield law. (A county clerk also cited the shield law as he refused to file the civil judgment from Texas.)",
      "\u201cThese are not doctors providing health care. They are drug dealers,\u201d Republican Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told state lawmakers as she promoted a bill that would expand who can sue and be sued in abortion medication cases. \u201cThey are violating our laws. They are sending illegal medications for purposes of procuring abortions that are illegal in our state.\u201d",
      "Julie Kay, the executive director of the Abortion Coalition for Telemedicine, the nationwide organization co-founded by Carpenter, said providers won\u2019t be \u201cbullied and intimidated\u201d into ceasing operations.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "NEW YORK -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Wednesday named eight new vaccine policy advisers to replace the panel that he abruptly dismissed earlier this week.",
      "They include a scientist who researched mRNA vaccine technology and became a conservative darling for his criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines, a leading critic of pandemic-era lockdowns, and a professor of operations management.",
      "Kennedy's decision to \u201cretire\u201d the previous 17-member Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices was widely decried by doctors' groups and public health organizations, who feared the advisers would be replaced by a group aligned with Kennedy's desire to reassess \u2014 and possibly end \u2014 longstanding vaccination recommendations.",
      "On Tuesday, before he announced his picks, Kennedy said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to bring great people onto the ACIP panel \u2013 not anti-vaxxers \u2013 bringing people on who are credentialed scientists.\u201d",
      "The new appointees include Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director for the National Association of Catholic Nurses, who has been listed as a board member and volunteer director for the National Vaccine Information Center, a group that is widely considered to be a leading source of vaccine misinformation.",
      "Another is Dr. Robert Malone, the former mRNA researcher who emerged as a close adviser to Kennedy during the measles outbreak. Malone, who runs a wellness institute and a popular blog, rose to prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as he relayed conspiracy theories around the outbreak and the vaccines that followed. He has appeared on podcasts and other conservative news outlets where he\u2019s promoted unproven and alternative treatments for measles and COVID-19.",
      "He has claimed that millions of Americans were hypnotized into taking the COVID-19 shots and has suggested that those vaccines cause a form of AIDS. He\u2019s downplayed deaths related to one of the largest measles outbreaks in the U.S. in years.",
      "Other appointees include Dr. Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician and epidemiologist who was a co-author of the Great Barrington Declaration, an October 2020 letter maintaining that pandemic shutdowns were causing irreparable harm. Dr. Cody Meissner, a former ACIP member, also was named.",
      "Abram Wagner of the University of Michigan\u2019s school of public health, who investigates vaccination programs, said he\u2019s not satisfied with the composition of the committee.",
      "\u201cThe previous ACIP was made up of technical experts who have spent their lives studying vaccines,\u201d he said. Most people on the current list \u201cdon\u2019t have the technical capacity that we would expect out of people who would have to make really complicated decisions involving interpreting complicated scientific data.\u201d",
      "He said having Pebsworth on the board is \u201cincredibly problematic\u201d since she is involved in an organization that \u201cdistributes a lot of misinformation.\u201d",
      "Kennedy made the announcement in a social media post on Wednesday.",
      "The committee, created in 1964, makes recommendations to the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. CDC directors almost always approve those recommendations on how vaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration should be used. The CDC\u2019s final recommendations are widely heeded by doctors and guide vaccination programs.",
      "The other appointees are:",
      "\u2014Dr. James Hibbeln, who formerly headed a National Institutes of Health group focused on nutritional neurosciences and who studies how nutrition affects the brain, including the potential benefits of seafood consumption during pregnancy.",
      "\u2014Retsef Levi, a professor of operations management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies business issues related to supply chain, logistics, pricing optimization and health and health care management. In a 2023 video pinned to an X profile under his name, Levi called for the end of the COVID-19 vaccination program, claiming the vaccines were ineffective and dangerous despite evidence they saved millions of lives.",
      "\u2014Dr. James Pagano, an emergency medicine physician from Los Angeles.",
      "\u2014Dr. Michael Ross, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist.",
      "Of the eight named by Kennedy, perhaps the most experienced in vaccine policy is Meissner, an expert in pediatric infectious diseases at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who has previously served as a member of both ACIP and the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s vaccine advisory panel.",
      "During his five-year term as an FDA adviser, the committee was repeatedly asked to review and vote on the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines that were rapidly developed to fight the pandemic. In September 2021, he joined the majority of panelists who voted against a plan from the Biden administration to offer an extra vaccine dose to all American adults. The panel instead recommended that the extra shot should be limited to seniors and those at higher risk of the disease.",
      "Ultimately, the FDA disregarded the panel\u2019s recommendation and OK\u2019d an extra vaccine dose for all adults.",
      "In addition to serving on government panels, Meissner has helped author policy statements and vaccination schedules for the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "ACIP members typically serve in staggered four-year terms, although several appointments were delayed during the Biden administration before positions were filled last year. The voting members all have scientific or clinical expertise in immunization, except for one \u201cconsumer representative\u201d who can bring perspective on community and social facets of vaccine programs.",
      "Kennedy, a leading voice in the anti-vaccine movement before becoming the U.S. government\u2019s top health official, has accused the committee of being too closely aligned with vaccine manufacturers and of rubber-stamping vaccines. ACIP policies require members to state past collaborations with vaccine companies and to recuse themselves from votes in which they had a conflict of interest, but Kennedy has dismissed those safeguards as weak.",
      "Most of the people who best understand vaccines are those who have researched them, which usually requires some degree of collaboration with the companies that develop and sell them, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher.",
      "\u201cIf you are to exclude any reputable, respected vaccine expert who has ever engaged even in a limited way with the vaccine industry, you\u2019re likely to have a very small pool of folks to draw from,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "The U.S. Senate confirmed Kennedy in February after he promised he would not change the vaccination schedule. But less than a week later, he vowed to investigate childhood vaccines that prevent measles, polio and other dangerous diseases.",
      "Kennedy has ignored some of the recommendations ACIP voted for in April, including the endorsement of a new combination shot that protects against five strains of meningococcal bacteria and the expansion of vaccinations against RSV.",
      "In late May, Kennedy disregarded the committee and announced the government would change the recommendation for children and pregnant women to get COVID-19 shots.",
      "On Monday, Kennedy ousted all 17 members of the ACIP, saying he would appoint a new group before the next scheduled meeting in late June. The agenda for that meeting has not yet been posted, but a recent federal notice said votes are expected on vaccinations against flu, COVID-19, HPV, RSV and meningococcal bacteria.",

The program provides monthly payments for food purchases to low-income residents generally earning less than $1,632 monthly for individuals, or $3,380 monthly for a household of four.",
      "The nation\u2019s first experiment with food stamps began in 1939. But the modern version of the program dates to 1979, when a change in federal law took effect eliminating a requirement that participants purchase food stamps. There currently is no cost to people participating in the program.",
      "A little over 42 million people nationwide received SNAP benefits in February, the latest month for which figures are available. That's roughly one out of every eight people in the county. Participation is down from a peak average of 47.6 million people during the 2013 federal fiscal year.",
      "Often, more than one person in a household is eligible for food aid. As of February, nearly 22.5 million households were enrolled SNAP, receiving an average monthly household benefit of $353.",
      "Legislation passed by the House is projected to cut about $295 billion of federal spending from SNAP over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "A little more than half of those federal savings would come by shifting costs to states, which administer SNAP. Nearly one-third of those savings would come by expanding a work requirement for some SNAP participants, which the CBO assumes would force some people off the rolls. Additional money would be saved by eliminating SNAP benefits for between 120,000 and 250,000 immigrants legally in the U.S. who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents.",
      "Another provision in the legislation would cap the annual inflationary growth in food benefits. As a result, the CBO estimates that the average monthly food benefit would be about $15 lower than it otherwise would have been by 2034.",
      "To receive SNAP benefits, current law says adults ages 18 through 54 who are physically and mentally able and don\u2019t have dependents would need to work, volunteer or participate in training programs for at least 80 hours a month. Those who don't do so are limited to just three months of benefits in a three-year period.",
      "The legislation that passed the House would expand work requirements to those ages 55 through 64. It also would extend work requirements to some parents without children younger than age 7. And it would limit the ability of states to waive work requirements in areas that lack sufficient jobs.",
      "The combined effect of those changes is projected by the CBO to reduce SNAP participation by a monthly average of 3.2 million people.",
      "The federal government currently splits the administrative costs of SNAP with states but covers the full cost of food benefits. Under the legislation, states would have to cover three-fourths of the administrative costs. States also would have to pay a portion of the food benefits starting with the 2028 fiscal year.",
      "All states would be required to pay at least 5% of the food aid benefits, and could pay more depending on how often they make mistakes with people\u2019s payments.",
      "States that had payment error rates between 6-8% in the most recent federal fiscal year for which data is available would have to cover 15% of the food costs. States with error rates between 8-10% would have to cover 20% of the food benefits, and those with error rates greater than 10% would have to cover 25% of the food costs.",
      "Many states could get hit with higher costs. The national error rate stood at 11.7% in the 2023 fiscal year, and just three states \u2014 Idaho, South Dakota and Vermont \u2014 had error rates below 5%. But the 2023 figures are unlikely to serve as the base year, so the exact costs to states remains unclear.",
      "As a result of the cost shift, the CBO assumes that some states would reduce or eliminate benefits for people.",
      "House Resolution 1, containing the SNAP changes and tax cuts, passed the House last month by a margin of just one vote \u2014 215-214.",
      "A vote also could be close in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats. Democrats did not support the bill in the House and are unlikely to do so in the Senate. Some Republican senators have expressed reservations about proposed cuts to food aid and Medicaid and the potential impact of the bill on the federal deficit. GOP Senate leaders may have to make some changes to the bill to ensure enough support to pass it.",

      "Throughout the outbreak, 96 people have been hospitalized.",
      "State health officials estimated less than 1% of cases \u2014 fewer than 10 \u2014 are actively infectious. Fifty-five percent of Texas\u2019 cases are in Gaines County, where the virus started spreading in a close-knit, undervaccinated Mennonite community. The county has had 411 cases since late January \u2014 just under 2% of the county\u2019s residents.",
      "The April 3 death in Texas was an 8-year-old child, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  Local health officials said the child did not have underlying health conditions and died of \u201cwhat the child\u2019s doctor described as measles pulmonary failure.\u201d A unvaccinated child with no underlying conditions died of measles in Texas in late February; Kennedy said the child was 6.",
      "New Mexico held steady Friday with a total of 81 cases.",
      "Seven people have been hospitalized since the outbreak started. Most of the state\u2019s cases are in Lea County. Sandoval County near Albuquerque has six cases, Eddy County has three, Don\u0303a Ana County has two. Chaves, Curry and San Juan counties have one each.",

      "Illinois health officials confirmed a four-case outbreak on May 5 in the far southern part of the state. It grew to eight cases as of June 6, but no new cases were reported in the following week, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health.",
      "The state's other two cases so far this year were in Cook County, and are unrelated to the southern Illinois outbreak.",

      "Earlier outbreaks in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania were declared over by health officials after six weeks of no new cases. Tennessee\u2019s outbreak also appears to be over.",
      "Cases and outbreaks in the U.S. are frequently traced to someone who caught the disease abroad. The CDC said in May that more than twice as many measles have come from outside of the U.S. compared to May of last year, and most of those are in unvaccinated Americans returning home. In 2019, the U.S. saw 1,274 cases and almost lost its status of having eliminated measles.",
      "The best way to avoid measles is to get the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. The first shot is recommended for children between 12 and 15 months old and the second between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "Getting another MMR shot as an adult is harmless if there are concerns about waning immunity, the CDC says. People who have documentation of receiving a live measles vaccine in the 1960s don\u2019t need to be revaccinated, but people who were immunized before 1968 with an ineffective vaccine made from \u201ckilled\u201d virus should be revaccinated with at least one dose, the agency said.",
      "People who have documentation that they had measles are immune, and those born before 1957 generally don\u2019t need the shots because so many children got measles back then that they have \u201cpresumptive immunity.\"",
      "Measles has a harder time spreading through communities with high vaccination rates \u2014 above 95% \u2014 due to \u201cherd immunity.\u201d But childhood vaccination rates have declined nationwide since the pandemic and more parents are claiming religious or personal conscience waivers to exempt their kids from required shots.",
      "Measles first infects the respiratory tract, then spreads throughout the body, causing a high fever, runny nose, cough, red, watery eyes and a rash.",
      "The rash generally appears three to five days after the first symptoms, beginning as flat red spots on the face and then spreading downward to the neck, trunk, arms, legs and feet. When the rash appears, the fever may spike over 104 degrees Fahrenheit, according to the CDC.",
      "Most kids will recover from measles, but infection can lead to dangerous complications such as pneumonia, blindness, brain swelling and death.",
      "There\u2019s no specific treatment for measles, so doctors generally try to alleviate symptoms, prevent complications and keep patients comfortable.",

      "VIENNA -- A former student who killed nine students and a teacher in Austria a week ago and then took his own life had become fascinated with school shootings in recent years, but his motive for the rampage remains unclear, investigators said Tuesday.",
      "Police have said the 21-year-old gunman planned last Tuesday's roughly seven-minute attack at the BORG Dreiersch\u00fctzengasse high school in Graz, which he left three years ago, down to the smallest detail. But much remains uncertain: among other things, why he chose that particular date and why he stopped shooting when he did.",
      "After his body was found, investigators found that the shooter still had 24 bullets in two magazines and another 18 loose bullets for his Glock handgun, as well as 17 bullets for his shotgun, said Michael Lohnegger, the head of Styria province\u2019s criminal police office.",
      "A few minutes before the shooting began, the gunman took a picture showing his legs and boots in a school bathroom and posted it to a social media account, Lohnegger said. Investigators are still working through some 30 other accounts attributed to him, created between 2019 and this year, to determine which are genuine.",
      "They can \u201csay with certainty that, over the years, he developed a significant passion in general terms for the phenomenon of school shootings,\u201d Lohnegger said. \u201cHe glorifies not just the acts in general, but also the perpetrators who carried out these acts.\"",
      "However, he said, police still have no information on his motive for the shooting.",
      "Eleven people were wounded last week. As of Tuesday, two had been released from hospitals but nine were still being treated, two of whom were still in intensive care, Lohnegger said. Their lives were not in danger.",
      "Chancellor Christian Stocker said Monday that Austria will tighten its gun laws, which are among the more liberal in the European Union. The gunman owned the two firearms he used legally.",

      "MADRID -- Six weeks after Spain and Portugal suffered a massive power outage, authorities in Madrid issued an official report Tuesday, saying April\u2019s cascading blackout that left tens of millions disconnected in seconds was caused by technical and planning errors that led to the grid's failure.",
      "Spain's Ecological Transition Minister Sara Aagesen, who manages the nation's energy policy, said in a press conference that small grid failures, concentrated in the south of Spain, led to a chain reaction among larger ones, while completely ruling out questions about a cyberattack.",
      "The minister said several technical causes that contributed to the event, including \u201cthe poor planning\u201d by operators of the grid who didn't find a replacement for one power plant that was supposed to help balance power fluctuations.",
      "The April 28 outage started shortly after 12:30 pm in Spain and lasted through nightfall, disrupting businesses, transit systems, cellular networks, Internet connectivity and other critical infrastructures. In just five seconds, Spain lost 15 gigawatts of electricity \u2014 or about 60% of its supply. Portugal, whose grid is connected to Spain's, also went down. Only the countries' island territories were spared.",
      "Power was fully restored by the early hours of the following day.",
      "The government report included analysts from Spain's national security agencies, which concluded, according to the minister, there were no indications of cyber-sabotage by foreign actors.",
      "The only solid information made public shortly after the system went down came from Spain's grid operator Red El\u00e9ctrica, which had narrowed down the source of the outage to two separate incidents in southern Spain where substations had failed.",
      "In the weeks following the blackout, citizens and experts were left wondering what triggered the event in a region not known for power outages and igniting a fierce debate about whether Spain's high levels of renewable power had something to do with the grid failing.",

      "After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After years of delay, South Korea has ratified the Hague Adoption Convention, an international treaty meant to safeguard international adoptions, marking a significant policy shift decades after sending tens of thousands of children to the West through an aggressive but poorly regulated adoption system.",
      "The government\u2019s announcement Tuesday came as it faces growing pressure to address widespread fraud and abuse that plagued its adoption program, particularly during a heyday in the 1970s and 1980s when the country allowed thousands of children to be adopted every year.",
      "Many adoptees have since discovered their records were falsified to portray them as abandoned orphans, carelessly separated or even stolen from their birth families.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Foreign Ministry and Health and Welfare Ministry, which handles adoption policies, issued a joint statement saying the country submitted the necessary documents to ratify the Hague Convention to the Dutch Foreign Ministry, the treaty\u2019s depositary.",
      "The treaty, which requires countries to strengthen state oversight and safeguards to ensure international adoptions are legal and ethical, will enter effect in South Korea on Oct. 1.",
      "South Korea signed the Hague Convention in 2013, but ratification was delayed by more than 10 years as the country struggled to bring adoptions under centralized government authority, as required by the treaty, after allowing private agencies to control international child placements for decades.",
      "\u201cGoing forward, intercountry adoptions will be permitted only when no suitable family can be found in his or her state of origin, and only if deemed to serve the child\u2019s best interests through deliberation by the adoption policy committee under the Ministry of Health and Welfare,\u201d the ministries said.",
      "The statement said the ratification was a significant step toward safeguarding children's rights and \u201cestablishing an advanced, internationally compliant intercountry adoption system in Korea, reinforcing the government\u2019s commitment to upholding state responsibility across the entire adoption process.\u201d",
      "A 2023 law also mandates the transfer of all adoption from private agencies to the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, aiming to centralize processing family search requests from adoptees who have returned to South Korea as adults seeking their roots.",
      "International adoptions from South Korea have plummeted in recent years, with only 58 in 2024, according to government data.",
      "During the 1980s, South Korea sent more than 6,000 children abroad each year, under a previous military government that viewed adoption as a way to reduce mouths to feed and curry favor with Western nations.",
      "Authorities specifically targeted children deemed socially undesirable, including those born to unwed mothers or impoverished families, and granted extensive powers to private adoption agencies to dictate child relinquishments and custody transfers, allowing them to send huge numbers of children abroad quickly.",
      "Much of South Korea\u2019s recent reforms have focused on abuse prevention, including a 2011 law reinstating judicial oversight of foreign adoptions that led to a significant drop in international placements. But officials are at a loss over how to handle the huge numbers of inaccurate or falsified records accumulated over past decades, which have prevented many adoptees from reconnecting with their birth families or obtaining accurate information about their biological origins.",
      "In a landmark report in March, South Korea\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission concluded the government bears responsibility for facilitating a foreign adoption program rife with fraud and abuse, driven by efforts to reduce welfare costs and enabled by private agencies that often manipulated children\u2019s backgrounds and origins.",
      "The commission\u2019s findings broadly aligned with a 2024 Associated Press investigation, in collaboration with Frontline (PBS), which detailed how South Korea\u2019s government, Western countries and adoption agencies worked in tandem to supply some 200,000 Korean children to parents overseas, despite years of evidence that many were being procured through questionable or outright unscrupulous means.",
      "South Korea\u2019s government has never acknowledged direct responsibility for issues related to past adoptions and has so far ignored the commission\u2019s recommendation to issue an apology.",
      "Some adoptees criticized the truth commission\u2019s cautiously worded report, arguing it should have more forcefully acknowledged the government\u2019s complicity and offered more concrete recommendations for reparations for illegal adoption victims. The commission\u2019s investigation deadline expired in May, after it confirmed human rights violations in just 56 of the 367 complaints filed by adoptees since 2022.",

      "Thai police say over a dozen foreigners, mostly Australians and British, were arrested for allegedly running an online investment fraud that had duped people out of at least $1.2 million",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thai police said Tuesday over a dozen foreigners, mostly Australians and British, were arrested for allegedly running an online investment fraud that had duped people out of at least 1.9 million Australian dollars (about $1.2 million).",
      "Police raided Monday a rental house in the province of Samut Prakan, neighboring Bangkok, and arrested 13 people, said Jirabhob Bhuridej, chief of the police\u2019s Central Investigation Bureau, at a press conference in the Thai capital.",
      "Jirabhob said the Australian Federal Police (AFP) informed Thai authorities last year of a scam group led by an Australian and a British, and a joint investigation was launched.",
      "The alleged scammers operated out of Thailand to swindle money from victims in Australia and potentially other English-speaking countries through online advertisements and phone calls to invest in long-term bonds with a promise of high returns, Jirabhob said.",
      "Footage showed the men after being arrested in the rental house that was converted into an office. Papers of alleged scam scripts and workflow were taped to their partitioned desks. There were also whiteboards the police said were used for tracking their progress, and clocks on a wall showing time zones across Australia.",
      "Thai police said they staked out the house for several months and saw the men coming and going at times that coincided with working hours in Australia. They said they confiscated a number of phones, computers and other electronic devices allegedly used for the scam.",
      "AFP senior officer Kristie-Lee Cressy said at the Bangkok press conference that at least 14,000 Australians had fallen victim to this scam.",
      "\u201cThe group amassed at least 1.9 million in (Australian dollars) from Australian victims in just the short time it had been operating. Money that we say was stolen from hard-working Australians and not invested as promised,\u201d she said. \u201cShutting down this scam center is a significant win for the communities of Thailand and Australia.\u201d",
      "Australian authorities believe the two leaders of the group had been running scams for many years and operating in several countries, including Indonesia, where they had escaped arrest before being found in Thailand, Jirabhob said.",
      "The group of men arrested in Thailand on Monday includes six British, five Australians, one Canadian and one South African, officials said. They said the suspects denied all wrongdoing, saying that they believed they were working legally for a legitimate investment company.",
      "Immigration officials said they entered Thailand with different kinds of visas, including for retirement and education.",
      "Jirabhob said they were initially charged with racketeering and working in Thailand without a permit. He said further investigation could lead to more serious charges, including fraud and involvement in a transnational organized crime.",
      "Australian police officer Cressy said Australia suffered an estimated damage of 4.45 billion Australian dollars ($2.9 billion) from online scams in the past four years.",
      "A U.N. report in April said transnational organized crime groups in East and Southeast Asia are spreading their lucrative scam operations across the globe in response to increased crackdowns by authorities.",

      "BANGKOK -- If the U.S. decides to support Israel more directly in its attack on Iran, one option for Washington would be to provide the \u201cbunker-buster\u201d bombs believed necessary to significantly damage the Fordo nuclear fuel enrichment plant, built deeply into a mountain.",
      "Such a bomb would have to be dropped from an American aircraft, which could have wide-ranging ramifications, including jeopardizing any chance of Iran engaging in Trump's desired talks on its nuclear program. Israeli officials have also suggested that there are other options for it to attack Fordo as it seeks to destroy Iran's nuclear capabilities.",
      "But aside from a commando attack on the ground or a nuclear strike, the bunker buster bomb seems the most likely option.",
      "\u201cBunker buster\u201d is a broad term used to describe bombs that are designed to penetrate deep below the surface before exploding. In this case, it refers to the latest GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator bomb in the American arsenal. The roughly 30,000 pound (13,600 kilogram) precision-guided bomb is designed to attack deeply buried and hardened bunkers and tunnels, according to the U.S. Air Force.",
      "It's believed to be able to penetrate about 200 feet (61 meters) below the surface before exploding, and the bombs can be dropped one after another, effectively drilling deeper and deeper with each successive blast.",
      "The bomb carries a conventional warhead, but the International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that Iran is producing highly enriched uranium at Fordo, raising the possibility that nuclear material could be released into the area if the GBU-57 A/B were used to hit the facility. However, Israeli strikes at another Iranian nuclear site, Natanz, on a centrifuge site have caused contamination only at the site itself, not the surrounding area, the IAEA has said.",
      "Fordo is Iran's second nuclear enrichment facility after Natanz, its main facility. So far, Israeli strikes aren\u2019t known to have damaged Natanz\u2019s underground enrichment hall, nor have the Israelis targeted tunnels the Iranians are digging nearby.",
      "Fordo is smaller than Natanz, and is built into the side of a mountain near the city of Qom, about 60 miles (95 kilometers) southwest of Tehran. Construction is believed to have started around 2006 and it became first operational in 2009 \u2014 the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence.",
      "In addition to being an estimated 80 meters (260 feet) under rock and soil, the site is reportedly protected by Iranian and Russian surface-to-air missile systems. Those air defenses, however, likely have already been struck in the Israeli campaign.",
      "Still, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the goal of attacking Iran was to eliminate its missile and nuclear program, which he described as an existential threat to Israel, and officials have said Fordo was part of that plan.",
      "\"This entire operation ... really has to be completed with the elimination of Fordo,\u201d Yechiel Leiter, Israel's ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News on Friday.",
      "In theory, the GBU-57 A/B could be dropped by any bomber capable of carrying the weight, but at the moment the U.S. has only configured and programed its B-2 Spirit stealth bomber to deliver the bomb, according to the Air Force.",
      "The B-2 is only flown by the Air Force, and is produced by Northrop Grumman.",
      "According to the manufacturer, the B-2 can carry a payload of 40,000 pounds (18,000 kilograms) but the U.S. Air Force has said it has successfully tested the B-2 loaded with two GBU-57 A/B bunker busters \u2014 a total weight of some 60,000 pounds (27,200 kilograms).",
      "The strategic long-range heavy bomber has a range of about 7,000 miles (11,000 kilometers) without refueling and 11,500 miles (18,500 kilometers) with one refueling, and can reach any point in the world within hours, according to Northrop Grumman.",
      "Whether the U.S. would get involved is another matter.",
      "At the G7 meeting in Canada, Trump was asked what it would take for Washington to become involved militarily and he said: \u201cI don't want to talk about that.\u201d",
      "In a weekend interview with ABC News, Israeli Ambassador Leiter was asked about the possibility of the U.S. helping attack Fordo and he emphasized Israel has only asked the U.S. for defensive help.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of contingencies ... which will enable us to deal with Fordo,\u201d he said.",

      "Justice Minister Pavel Bla\u017eek resigned from his post over the issue on May 30 and was replaced by Eva Decroix on June 10.",
      "Bla\u017eek said he wasn\u2019t aware of any wrongdoing, but didn\u2019t want the coalition to be harmed by the scandal. Fiala said he appreciated his resignation and believed Bla\u017eek acted with goodwill.",

      "As Israel pounds Iran with airstrikes targeting military facilities and its nuclear sites, officials in Tehran have proposed a variety of steps the Islamic Republic could take outside of launching retaliatory missile barrages",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As Israel pounds Iran with airstrikes targeting military facilities and its nuclear sites, officials in Tehran have proposed a variety of steps the Islamic Republic could take outside of launching retaliatory missile barrages.",
      "Those proposals mirror those previously floated by Iran in confrontations with either Israel or the United States in that last few decades. They included disrupting maritime shipping through the Strait of Hormuz, potentially leaving the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and other attacks by militants.",
      "Here's a look at what those options could mean \u2014 both to Iran and the wider Middle East.",
      "The Strait of Hormuz is the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf, through which some 20% of all oil traded globally passes.",
      "The strait is in the territorial waters of Iran and Oman, which at its narrowest point is just 33 kilometers (21 miles) wide. The width of the shipping lane in either direction is only 3 kilometers (2 miles). Anything affecting it ripples through global energy markets, potentially raising the price of crude oil. That then trickles down to consumers through what they pay for gasoline and other oil products.",
      "There has been a wave of attacks on ships attributed to Iran since 2019, following President Donald Trump's decision to unilaterally withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and re-imposing crushing sanctions on Tehran.",
      "U.S. forces routinely travel through the strait, despite sometimes-tense encounters with Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guard, a paramilitary force answerable only to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The U.S. Navy's Bahrain-based 5th Fleet conducts those operations, known as freedom of navigation missions, to ensure the waterway remains open to business. Iran views those passages as challenging its sovereignty \u2014 as if it operated off the coast of the U.S.",
      "Since the Israeli attacks began, Iranian officials have repeatedly raised blocking the strait \u2014 which likely would draw an immediate American response.",
      "Experts fear Tehran could respond to the strike by deciding to fully end its cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, abandon the the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and rush toward a bomb.",
      "As a member of the treaty, Iran is obligated to explain the any radioactive traces outside of declared sites and to provide assurances that they are not being used as part of a nuclear weapons program. Iran insists its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed state to enrich uranium up to 60%, a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA assess Iran hasn't had an organized military nuclear program since 2003.",
      "There is precedence for the concern. North Korea said it withdrew from the treaty in 2003 and tested a nuclear weapon in 2006.",
      "However, again, if Iran withdrew from the treaty, it could draw the U.S. into the fight, something Tehran so far has been seeking to avoid.",
      "Iran could encourage more asymmetric attacks, targeting Jewish tourists, synagogues or Israeli diplomatic missions as it has done in the past. However, it's been a rough few years for those forces.",
      "Iran\u2019s allies, the self-described \u201cAxis of Resistance,\u201d have been severely hurt by ongoing Israeli attacks since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, particularly Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Iran has long used those groups as both an asymmetrical way to attack Israel and as a shield against a direct assault.",
      "Iraqi groups backed by Iran so far haven't gotten involved, leaving just Yemen's Houthi rebels as the only member of the axis to launch attacks on Israel since its campaign against Iran began.",

      "The report released Tuesday says that the industry, which accounts for about 3.6% of Indonesia's economic activity and employs tens of thousands of people, needs to shift toward cleaner energy now or risk being forced into a costly transition later.",
      "Indonesia is the world\u2019s biggest exporter of coal, which is central to its economy, generating tax revenues and jobs. So the expected long-term decline in demand presents a unique challenge for the country of some 280 million. Indonesia\u2019s coal production is still rising, hitting a record 836 million tons in 2024, nearly 8% more than the year before.",
      "The industry also relies heavily on just a few buyers, with China and India buying nearly two-thirds of Indonesia's coal exports in 2023.",
      "China still relies on coal for more than half its electricity generation. It accounted for 41% of global coal imports in 2024, or nearly 543 million tons. But more than 75% of the growth in demand last year was met by clean energy.",

The drop is part of India\u2019s push to reduce import dependence by ramping up domestic coal production. Imports for industries like cement, steel and aluminum that buy coal at market rates declined 12% while imports for thermal power plants fell even more sharply, down 29.8%.",
      "Indonesia's coal exports fell to a three-year low in January-April of this year, a shift that may signal a longer term decline, experts say.",
      "\u201cThese are signs that Indonesian coal miners have to start taking seriously as well,\u201d said Hazel Ilango of the Energy Shift Institute.",
      "There are other risks too. Most Indonesian coal companies are tightly controlled by insiders \u2014 owners, executives, and board members \u2014 who hold about 75% of company shares on average, according to the report. Regulations such as domestic supply rules and high royalties also limit profits, while access to global financing remains restricted.",
      "The private sector and investors are generally uninterested in long-term transition plans and are more focused on immediate profits, while government policies remain inconsistent, said Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute.",
      "Experts say that the country\u2019s coal policy is riddled with contradictions. It has pledged to cut emissions and transition to clean energy, but it continues to expand coal production and approve new plants. Domestic subsidies keep coal cheap, but abrupt export bans have disrupted global markets. Meanwhile, the state utility plans to retire coal plants early under a $20 billion transition deal \u2014 even as new ones tied to the industry are still being built.",
      "As major coal importers like China and India cut imports to boost their energy security, Indonesia\u2019s coal sector needs to plan ahead, said Jordan Lee, an energy transition expert at the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta.",
      "\u201cThe reason I say that is basically if you look at what happened with some big oil companies that have tried something similar, we have seen the market not respond too positively,\u201d he said.",

      "After Israel launched airstrikes against Iran on June 13, worry mounted over whether the Islamic Republic might block the waterway.",
      "Maritime ship experts say shipowners are increasingly wary of using the waterway, with some ships having tightened security and others canceling routes there. As the Israel-Iran warfare intensified over the weekend, hundreds of ships in the strait saw spotty navigation signals and had to rely more on radar, though it wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused Tuesday\u2019s incident.",

      "Asked what it would take for the U.S. to get involved in the conflict militarily, Trump said Monday morning, \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about that.\u201c",
      "But by Monday afternoon, Trump warned ominously on social media, \u201cEveryone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\u201d Shortly after that, Trump decided to leave the summit and skip a series of Tuesday meetings that would address the war in Ukraine and trade issues.",
      "The sudden departure only heightened the drama of a world that seems on verge of several firestorms. Trump already has imposed severe tariffs on multiple nations that risk a global economic slowdown. There has been little progress on settling the wars in Ukraine and Gaza.",
      "Trump\u2019s stance on Ukraine puts him fundamentally at odds with the other G7 leaders, who back Ukraine and are clear that Russia is the aggressor in the war.",
      "The U.S. president on Monday suggested there would have been no war if G7 members hadn\u2019t expelled Putin from the organization in 2014 for annexing Crimea.",
      "Trump on Monday demurred when asked if he supported Russia, saying \u201cI only care about saving lives.\u201d",
      "With talks on ending the war at an impasse, Starmer said Britain and other G7 members were slapping new tariffs on Russia in a bid to get it to the ceasefire negotiating table. Ukraine\u2019s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is due to attend the summit Tuesday at Carney\u2019s invitation, along with other leaders including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NATO chief Mark Rutte.",
      "Trump declined to join in the sanctions on Russia, saying he would wait until Europe did so first.",
      "\u201cWhen I sanction a country that costs the U.S. a lot of money, a tremendous amount of money,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump had been scheduled before his departure to meet with Zelenskyy and with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum.",
      "On the Middle East, Merz told reporters that Germany was planning to draw up a final communique proposal on the Israel-Iran conflict that will stress that \u201cIran must under no circumstances be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons-capable material.\u201d",
      "Trump also seemed to put a greater priority on addressing his grievances with other nations\u2019 trade policies than on collaboration with G7 allies. The U.S. president has imposed 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as 25% tariffs on autos. Trump is also charging a 10% tax on imports from most countries, though he could raise rates on July 9, after the 90-day negotiating period set by him would expire.",
      "He announced with Starmer that they had signed a trade framework Monday that was previously announced in May, with Trump saying that British trade was \u201cvery well protected\u2019 because \u201dI like them, that\u2019s why. That\u2019s their ultimate protection.\u201d",

      "It was one of the deadliest attacks on Kyiv in recent months and came after two rounds of direct peace talks failed to make progress on ending the war, now in its fourth year.",
      "Russia has repeatedly hit civilian areas of Ukraine with missiles and drones. The attacks have killed more than 12,000 Ukrainian civilians, according to the United Nations. Russia says it strikes only military targets.",
      "Russia has in recent months stepped up its aerial attacks. It launched almost 500 drones at Ukraine on June 10 in the biggest overnight drone bombardment of the war. Russia also pounded Kyiv on April 24, killing at least 12 people in its deadliest assault on the capital in eight months.",
      "The intensified long-range strikes have coincided with a Russian summer offensive on eastern and northeastern sections of the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, where Ukraine is short-handed and needs more military support from its Western partners.",
      "Uncertainty about U.S. policy on the war has fueled doubts about how much help Kyiv can count on.

      "The Russian military said it downed 203 Ukrainian drones over 10 Russian regions between Monday evening and Tuesday morning.",

      "\u201cFlights, markets, everything is closed, and I am living in the basement of a small hotel,\u201d Hussein told The Associated Press by cellphone on Monday. \"I am trying to get to the border by taxi, but they are hard to find, and no one is taking us.\u201d",
      "Israel launched a major attack Friday with strikes in the Iranian capital of Tehran and elsewhere, killing senior military officials, nuclear scientists, and destroying critical infrastructure. Among the targets was a nuclear enrichment facility about 18 miles from Qom. Iran has retaliated with hundreds of drones and missiles.",
      "The dayslong attacks between the two bitter enemies have opened a new chapter in their turbulent recent history. Many in the region fear a wider conflict as they watch waves of attacks across their skies every night.",
      "The conflict has forced most countries in the Middle East to close their airspace. Dozens of airports have stopped all flights or severely reduced operations, leaving tens of thousands of passengers stranded and others unable to flee the conflict or travel home.",
      "\u201cThe domino effect here is massive,\u201d said retired pilot and aviation safety expert John Cox, who said the disruptions will have a huge price tag.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got thousands of passengers suddenly that are not where they\u2019re supposed to be, crews that are not where they are supposed to be, airplanes that are not where they\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d he said.",

Now he\u2019s waiting at a Larnaca hotel while speaking to his wife in Jerusalem. \u201cI\u2019m debating what to do,\u201d Berg said.",

      "Though airspace is still partially open in Lebanon and Jordan, the situation is chaotic at airports, with many passengers stranded locally and abroad with delayed and canceled flights even as the busy summer tourism season begins. Many airlines have reduced flights or stopped them altogether, and authorities have closed airports overnight when attacks are at their most intense. Syria, under new leadership, had just renovated its battered airports and begun restoring diplomatic ties when the conflict began.",
      "Neighboring Iraq\u2019s airports have all closed due to its close proximity to Iran. Israel reportedly used Iraqi airspace, in part, to launch its strikes on Iran, while Iranian drones and missiles flying the other way have been downed over Iraq.

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- The death toll from an attack by gunmen over the weekend in north-central Nigeria has climbed to 150, survivors said Monday as the villagers were still digging through burned homes, counting their dead and looking for dozens of people still missing.",
      "Assailants stormed Benue state\u2019s Yelewata community late on Friday night, opening fire on villagers who were asleep and setting their homes ablaze, survivors and the local farmers union said. Many of those killed were sheltering in a local market after fleeing violence in other parts of the state.",
      "No one immediately claimed responsibility for the killings, but such attacks are common in Nigeria\u2019s northern region where local herders and farmers often clash over limited access to land and water. The prolonged conflict has become deadlier in recent years, with authorities and analysts warning that more herdsmen are taking up arms.",
      "The farmers accuse the herders, mostly of Fulani origin, of grazing their livestock on their farms and destroying their produce. The herders insist that the lands are grazing routes that were first backed by law in 1965, five years after the country gained its independence.",
      "Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu, whose government has fallen short of expectations in ending the country\u2019s deadly security crises, described the Benue attack as \u201csenseless bloodletting\u201d while his office said he would visit the stricken community on Wednesday.",
      "Titus Tsegba, who lost his wife and four of his children in the attack, said more than 20 bodies were recovered on Monday. The initial death toll was reported to be 100 on Saturday.",
      "His wife and children \u2014 the youngest 8 and the oldest 27 \u2014 were \u201cburned into ashes beyond recognition,\u201d he told The Associated Press, adding that he survived because he was sleeping in another part of the community.",
      "\"Everything is gone,\u201d he said.",
      "Benue Deputy Gov. Sam Ode said he suspected the perpetrators were herdsmen. Ode and the survivors spoke to the AP by phone.",
      "The gunmen made it difficult for many to flee after surrounding the Yelewata community, which is about 120 kilometers (75 miles) away from the state capital of Makurdi, said Jacob Psokaa, who lost his 55-year-old father in the attack.",
      "\u201cThey were coming from different sides at the same moment \u2026 it was sporadic shooting,\u201d Psokaa said. \u201cThe situation is very bad now with many people in the ground \u2026 your people leaving you suddenly.\u201d",
      "The gunmen also burned food stores in the local market, razing a year\u2019s harvest that included rice and yam, staple food mainly exported from Benue to other parts of Nigeria.",
      "\u201cEnough is enough!\u201d said Tinubu, the president. \u201cI have directed the security agencies to act decisively, arrest perpetrators of these evil acts on all sides of the conflict, and prosecute them.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that he would likely extend a deadline for TikTok's Chinese owner to divest the popular video sharing app.",
      "Trump had signed an order in early April to keep TikTok running for another 75 days after a potential deal to sell the app to American owners was put on ice.",
      "\u201cProbably yeah, yeah,\" he responded when asked by reporters on Air Force One whether the deadline would be extended again.",
      "\"Probably have to get China approval but I think we\u2019ll get it. I think President Xi will ultimately approve it.\u201d",
      "He indicated in an interview last month with NBC that he would be open to pushing back the deadline again.",
      "If announced, it would be the third time Trump has extended the deadline. The first one was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when the ban approved by Congress \u2014 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 took effect. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",
      "It is not clear how many times Trump can \u2014 or will \u2014 keep extending the ban as the government continues to try to negotiate a deal for TikTok, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance. Trump has amassed more than 15 million followers on TikTok since he joined last year, and he has credited the trendsetting platform with helping him gain traction among young voters.

      "The move comes nearly two months after U.S. health officials said that they would urge foodmakers to phase out petroleum-based artificial colors in the nation\u2019s food supply.",
      "Kraft Heinz said Tuesday that almost 90% of its U.S. products already don't contain food, drug & cosmetic colors, but that the products that do still use the dyes will have them removed by the end of 2027. FD&C colors are synthetic additives that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in food, drugs and cosmetics.",
      "The company said that it will instead use natural colors for the products.",
      "\u201cThe vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we\u2019ve been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" Pedro Navio, North America President at Kraft Heinz, said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz stripped artificial colors, flavors and preservatives from its macaroni and cheese in 2016 and said it has never used artificial dyes in its ketchup.",
      "The company plans to work with licensees of its brands to encourage them to remove the dyes.",
      "In April Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary said at a news conference that the agency would take steps to eliminate the synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children. The FDA has maintained that the approved dyes are safe and that \u201cthe totality of scientific evidence shows that most children have no adverse effects when consuming foods containing color additives.\u201d",
      "The FDA currently allows 36 food color additives, including eight synthetic dyes. In January, the agency announced that the dye known as Red 3 \u2014 used in candies, cakes and some medications \u2014 would be banned in food by 2027 because it caused cancer in laboratory rats.",
      "Artificial dyes are used widely in U.S. foods. In Canada and in Europe \u2014 where synthetic colors are required to carry warning labels \u2014 manufacturers mostly use natural substitutes. Several states, including California and West Virginia, have passed laws restricting the use of artificial colors in foods.",
      "Many U.S. food companies are already reformulating their foods, according to Sensient Colors, one of the world\u2019s largest producers of food dyes and flavorings. In place of synthetic dyes, foodmakers can use natural hues made from beets, algae and crushed insects and pigments from purple sweet potatoes, radishes and red cabbage.",

      "Sales at retail stores and restaurants dropped 0.9% in May, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, after a decline of 0.1% in April. The figure was pulled down by a steep drop in auto sales, after Americans ramped up their car-buying in March to get ahead of Trump\u2019s 25% duty on imported cars and car parts. Excluding autos, sales fell 0.3%.",
      "The sales drop comes after sharp declines in consumer confidence this year. Still, inflation has cooled steadily and unemployment remains low, which could fuel steady spending in the coming months, as the economy has remained mostly solid.",
      "Sales dropped 2.7% last month at home and garden centers, 0.6% at electronics and appliance stores, and 0.7% at grocery stores. There were some bright spots: Sales rose 0.9% at online retailers, 0.8% at clothing stores, and 1.2% at furniture stores.",

      "LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 LeBron James may be daydreaming about Prime Day deals in his new Amazon commercial, but there\u2019s no fantasy when it comes to his real-life focus: getting his knee healthy in time for training camp.",
      "The Los Angeles Lakers superstar plans to return for his 23rd NBA season, which would make him the first player in league history to reach that milestone. But before he steps back on the court, James is prioritizing rest and recovery after he sustained a knee injury in the final game of the Lakers' playoff run.",
      "James, 40, said his left knee is feeling \u201cgood\u201d after spraining a ligament in April, following the Lakers season-ending loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves. He emphasized that maintaining his body \u2014 through disciplined eating and training routines \u2014 remains essential to performing at the highest level.",
      "\u201cI have a lot of time to take care of my injury, my knee, the rest of my body and make sure I\u2019m as close to 100% as possible when training camp begins in late September,\u201d James told The Associated Press. He spoke during an interview about starring in a new 60-second commercial called \u201cWhat's Next?,\u201d which announces the July 8-11 Prime Day dates as part of a global \u201cGreatness is a Deal Away\u201d campaign.",
      "These days, James has built a wide-reaching partnership with Amazon, launching his men's grooming line and hosting the \u201cMind the Game\u201d podcast alongside NBA legend Steve Nash through Wondery.",
      "In the commercial, James is asked whether the retirement rumors are true, but his attention drifts toward the deals. While the NBA\u2019s all-time leading scorer might be tempted by discounts, he\u2019s far from done with the game. He still thrives on the daily grind \u2014 including practices, film sessions and shootarounds \u2014 and hasn\u2019t lost the hunger to compete.",
      "A major reason he continues to push forward? Family. James credits the unwavering support of his wife, Savannah, and their three kids as a driving force. He\u2019s inspired by the chance to share the court with his oldest son, Bronny, who plays for the Lakers; to watch Bryce begin his college journey at the University of Arizona; and to cheer on Zhuri as she pursues volleyball.",
      "The best thing about his children is they've never pressured him to end his career, said James, who has a player option for next season that will pay him more than $56.2 million. Last season, he averaged 24.4 points per game along with 8.2 assists and 7.8 rebounds and was an All-NBA selection.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re like \u2018Dad, continue on your dream. This is your dream. Continue on your focus. You\u2019ve been here for us this whole time,'\" he continued. \"When you have that type of support... it makes it a lot easier.\u201d",
      "James knows the end of his legendary career is coming, but he\u2019s just not sure when. He said it would be \u201cinsane\u201d if he stuck around long enough to play with his son, Bryce, who would be draft eligible in 2026.",
      "\u201cAt this point of my career, you think about when the end is. That\u2019s human nature,\u201d he said. \u201cYou think: Is it this year? Or next year? Those thoughts always creep into your mind at this point of the journey. But I have not given it a specific timetable, date. I\u2019m seeing how my body and family reacts, too.\u201d",

      "The Senate is voting on legislation regulating a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to approve legislation Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what is expected to be a wave of crypto legislation from Congress that the industry hopes will bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.",
      "The fast-moving legislation, which will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle where the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.",
      "Eighteen Democratic senators have shown support for the legislation as it has advanced, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate. If passed, it would become the second major bipartisan bill to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act on immigration enforcement in January.",
      "Still, most Democrats oppose the bill. They have raised concerns that the measure does little to address President Donald Trump\u2019s personal financial interests in the crypto space.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,\" said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., on Monday. She added, \u201cThis is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.\u201d",
      "Known as the GENIUS Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "It's expected to pass Tuesday, since it only requires a simple majority vote \u2014 and it already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.",
      "There is a provision in the bill that bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.",
      "Trump hosted a private dinner last month at his golf club with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1.",
      "The administration is broadly supportive of crypto's growth and its integration into the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the legislation could help push the U.S. stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028.",
      "Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest crypto exchange and a major advocate for the bill \u2014 has met with Trump and praised his early moves on crypto. This past weekend, Coinbase was among the more prominent brands that sponsored a parade in Washington commemorating the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 an event that coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "But the crypto industry emphasizes that they view the legislative effort as bipartisan, pointing to champions on each side of the aisle.",
      "\u201cThe GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the U.S. Senate,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said ahead of a key vote last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the product of months of bipartisan work.\u201d",
      "The bill did hit one rough patch in early May, when a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously supported the bill reversed course and voted to block it from advancing. That prompted new negotiations involving Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, which ultimately produced the compromise version expected to win passage Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere were many, many changes that were made. And ultimately, it\u2019s a much better deal because we were all at the table,\u201d Alsobrooks said.",
      "Still, the bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest \u2014 an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, warning that the bill creates a \u201csuper highway\u201d for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.",
      "If the stablecoin legislation passes the Senate on Tuesday, it still faces several hurdles before reaching the president\u2019s desk. It must clear the narrowly held Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill \u2014 sweeping legislation that could make passage through the Senate more difficult.",
      "Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.",

      "Louisiana soon could raise taxes on sports betting to help finance the athletic departments at many of its public universities",
      "Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments at the state's most prominent public universities.",
      "Legislation pending before Gov. Jeff Landry would make Louisiana the first state to raise taxes to fund college sports since a judge approved a landmark settlement with the NCAA allowing schools to directly pay athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Anticipating the court's approval, Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on NIL payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",
      "More states seem almost certain to adopt their own creative ways to gain an edge \u2014 or at least keep pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college sports.",
      "\u201cThese bills, and the inevitable ones that will follow, are intended to make states \u2019college-athlete friendly,'\u201d said David Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group consultancy and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California. But \u201cthey will no doubt continue to stoke the debate about the `perceived' preferential treatment afforded athletes.\u201d",
      "The new NCCA rules allowing direct payments to college athletes kick in July 1. In the first year, each Division I school can share up to $20.5 million with its athletes \u2014 a figure that may be easier to meet for big-time programs than for smaller schools weighing whether to divert money from other purposes. The settlement also continues to allow college athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, such as donor-backed collectives that support specific schools.",
      "The Louisiana legislation won final approval just two days after a judge approved the antitrust settlement between the NCAA and athletes, but it had been in the works for months. Athletic directors from many of Louisiana's universities met earlier this year and hashed out a plan with lawmakers to relieve some of their financial pressures by dividing a share of the state's sports betting tax revenue.",
      "The biggest question for lawmakers was how large of a tax increase to support. The initial proposal sought to double the state's 15% tax on net proceeds from online sports betting. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on a 21.5% tax rate in a compromise with the industry.",
      "One-quarter of the tax revenue from online sports wagering \u2014 an estimated $24.3 million \u2014 would be split equally among 11 public universities in conferences with Division I football programs. The money must be used \u201cfor the benefit of student athletes,\u201d including scholarships, insurance, medical coverage, facility enhancements and litigation settlement fees.",
      "The state tax money won't provide direct NIL payments to athletes. But it could facilitate that indirectly by freeing up other university resources.",
      "The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the final days of Louisiana's annual session.",
      "\u201cWe love football in Louisiana \u2013 that\u2019s the easiest way to say it,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Neil Riser, who sponsored the bill.",
      "Many colleges and universities across the country have been feeling a financial squeeze, but it's especially affected the athletic departments of smaller schools.",
      "Athletic departments in the top Division I football conferences take in millions of dollars from media rights, donors, corporate sponsors and ticket sales, with a median of just 7% coming from student fees and institutional and government support, according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database.",
      "But the remaining schools in Division I football bowl conferences got a median of 63% of the revenue from such sources last year. And schools without football teams got a median of 81% of their athletic department revenues from institutional and governmental support or student fees.",
      "Riser said Louisiana's smaller universities, in particular, have been struggling financially and have shifted money from their general funds to their sports programs to try to remain competitive. At the same time, the state has taken in millions of dollars of tax revenue from sports bets made at least partly on college athletics.",
      "\u201cWithout the athletes, we wouldn\u2019t have the revenue. I just felt like it\u2019s fairness that we do give something back and, at the same time, help the general funds of the universities,\u201d Riser said.",
      "Louisiana would become the second state behind North Carolina to dedicate a portion of its sports wagering revenues to colleges athletics. North Carolina launched online sports wagering last year under a state law earmarking part of an 18% tax on gross gaming revenue to the athletic departments at 13 public universities. The state's two largest institutions were excluded. But that might be about to change.",
      "Differing budget plans passed by the state House and Senate this year both would start allotting sports betting tax revenue to the athletic programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The Senate version also would double the tax rate. The proposals come a year after University of North Carolina trustees approved an audit of the athletics department after a preliminary budget projected about $100 million of debt in the years ahead.",
      "Other schools also are taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct NIL payments to athletes. That came after trustees in April voted to convert the Kentucky athletics department into a limited-liability holding company \u2014 Champions Blue LLC \u2014 to more nimbly navigate the emerging financial pressures.",
      "Given the money involved in college athletics, it's not surprising that states are starting to provide tax money to athletic departments or \u2014 as in Arkansas' case \u2014 tax relief to college athletes, said Patrick Rishe, executive director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "\u201cIf you can attract better athletes to your schools and your states, then this is more visibility to your states, this is more potential out-of-town economic activity for your state,\" Rishe said. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see many states pursue this, because you don\u2019t want to be the state that\u2019s left exposed or at a disadvantage.\u201d",

      "Senate Republicans are proposing deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making President Donald Trump\u2019s tax breaks more permanent",
      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Republicans on Monday proposed deeper Medicaid cuts, including new work requirements for parents of teens, as a way to offset the costs of making President Donald Trump's tax breaks more permanent in draft legislation unveiled for his \u201cbig, beautiful bill.\u201d",
      "The proposals from Republicans keep in place the current $10,000 deduction of state and local taxes, called SALT, drawing quick blowback from GOP lawmakers from New York and other high-tax states, who fought for a $40,000 cap in the House-passed bill. Senators insisted negotiations continue.",
      "The Senate draft also enhances Trump's proposed new tax break for seniors, with a bigger $6,000 deduction for low- to moderate-income senior households earning no more than $75,000 a year for singles, $150,000 for couples.",
      "All told, the text unveiled by the Senate Finance Committee Republicans provides the most comprehensive look yet at changes the GOP senators want to make to the 1,000-page package approved by House Republicans last month. GOP leaders are pushing to fast-track the bill for a vote by Trump's Fourth of July deadline.",
      "Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, the chairman, said the proposal would prevent a tax hike and achieve \u201csignificant savings\u201d by slashing green energy funds \u201cand targeting waste, fraud and abuse.\"",
      "It comes as Americans broadly support levels of funding for popular safety net programs, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Many Americans see Medicaid and food assistance programs as underfunded.",
      "Trump's big bill is the centerpiece of his domestic policy agenda, a hodgepodge of GOP priorities all rolled into what he calls the \u201cbeautiful bill\u201d that Republicans are trying to swiftly pass over unified opposition from Democrats \u2014 a tall order for the slow-moving Senate.",
      "Fundamental to the package is the extension of some $4.5 trillion in tax breaks approved during his first term, in 2017, that are expiring this year if Congress fails to act. There are also new ones, including no taxes on tips, as well as more than $1 trillion in program cuts.",
      "After the House passed its version, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the bill would add $2.4 trillion to the nation\u2019s deficits over the decade, and leave 10.9 fewer people without health insurance, due largely to the proposed new work requirements and other changes.",
      "The biggest tax breaks, some $12,000 a year, would go to the wealthiest households, CBO said, while the poorest would see a tax hike of roughly $1,600. Middle-income households would see tax breaks of $500 to $1,000 a year, CBO said.",
      "Both the House and Senate packages are eyeing a massive $350 billion buildup of Homeland Security and Pentagon funds, including some $175 billion for Trump's mass deportation efforts, such as the hiring of 10,000 more officers for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.",
      "This comes as protests over deporting migrants have erupted nationwide \u2014 including the stunning handcuffing of Sen. Alex Padilla last week in Los Angeles \u2014 and as deficit hawks such as Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul are questioning the vast spending on Homeland Security.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer warned that the Senate GOP's draft \u201ccuts to Medicaid are deeper and more devastating than even the Republican House\u2019s disaster of a bill.\u201d",
      "As the package now moves to the Senate, the changes to Medicaid, SALT and green energy programs are part of a series of tradeoffs GOP leaders are making as they try to push the package to passage with their slim majorities, with almost no votes to spare.",
      "But criticism of the Senate's version came quickly after House Speaker Mike Johnson warned senators off making substantial changes.",
      "\u201cWe have been crystal clear that the SALT deal we negotiated in good faith with the Speaker and the White House must remain in the final bill,\u201d the co-chairs of the House SALT caucus, Reps. Young Kim, R-Calif., and Andrew Garbarino, R-N.Y., said in a joint statement Monday.",
      "Republican Rep. Nicole Malliotakis of New York posted on X that the $10,000 cap in the Senate bill was not only insulting, but a \u201cslap in the face to the Republican districts that delivered our majority and trifecta\u201d with the White House.",
      "Some of the largest cost savings in the package come from the GOP plan to impose new work requirements on able-bodied single adults, ages 18 to 64 and without dependents, who receive Medicaid, the health care program used by 80 million Americans.",
      "While the House first proposed the new Medicaid work requirement, it exempted parents with dependents. The Senate's version broadens the requirement to include parents of children older than 14, as part of their effort to combat waste in the program and push personal responsibility.",
      "Already, the Republicans had proposed expanding work requirements in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP, to include older Americans up to age 64 and parents of school-age children older than 10. The House had imposed the requirement on parents of children older than 7.",
      "People would need to work 80 hours a month or be engaged in a community service program to qualify.",
      "One Republican, Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, has joined a few others pushing to save Medicaid from steep cuts \u2014 including to the so-called provider tax that almost all states levy on hospitals as a way to help fund their programs.",
      "The Senate plan proposes phasing down that provider tax, which is now up to 6%. Starting in 2027, the Senate looks to gradually lower that threshold until it reaches 3.5% in 2031, with exceptions for nursing homes and intermediate care facilities.",
      "Hawley slammed the Senate bill's changes on the provider tax. \u201cThis needs a lot of work. It\u2019s really concerning and I\u2019m really surprised by it,\u201d he said. \u201cRural hospitals are going to be in bad shape.\"",
      "The Senate also keeps in place the House's proposed new $35-per-service co-pay imposed on some Medicaid patients who earn more than the poverty line, which is about $32,000 a year for a family of four, with exceptions for some primary, prenatal, pediatric and emergency room care.",

      "The U.S. economy is mostly in good shape but that isn\u2019t saving Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell from a spell of angst",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. economy is mostly in good shape but that isn't saving Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell from a spell of angst.",
      "As the Fed considers its next moves during a two-day meeting this week, most economic data looks solid: Inflation has been steadily fading, while the unemployment rate is still a historically low 4.2%. Yet President Donald Trump's widespread tariffs may push inflation higher in the coming months, while also possibly slowing growth.",
      "With the outlook uncertain, Fed policymakers are expected to keep their key interest rate unchanged on Wednesday at about 4.4%. Officials will also release a set of quarterly economic projections that are expected to show inflation will accelerate later this year, while unemployment my also tick up a bit.",
      "The projections may also signal that the Fed will cut its key rate twice later this year, economists say.",
      "The prospect of higher inflation would typically lead the Fed to keep rates unchanged or even raise them, while rising unemployment would usually lead the Fed to cut its key rate. With the economy potentially pulling in both directions, Powell and other Fed officials have underscored in recent remarks that they are prepared to wait for clearer signals on which way to move.",
      "The Fed is in \u201can uncomfortable purgatory,\u201d said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting giant KPMG. \u201cWithout the threat of tariffs, we would be seeing the Fed cut. That's not where we're at because of the uncertainty and the threat and the effects (of tariffs) that we don't know yet.\"",
      "The Trump White House has sharply ramped up the pressure on Powell to reduce borrowing costs, with Trump himself calling the Fed chair a \u201cnumbskull\u201d for not cutting and other officials, including Vice President JD Vance and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also calling for a rate reduction.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key short-term rate, it often \u2014 though not always \u2014 leads to lower costs for consumer and business borrowing, including for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards. Yet financial markets also influence the level of longer-term rates and can keep them elevated even if the Fed reduces the shorter-term rate it controls.",
      "For example, if investors worry that inflation will remain elevated, they can demand higher interest rates on longer-term Treasury securities, which influence other borrowing costs.",
      "Even though Trump has said the economy is doing well, he has also argued that a rate cut would cause the economy to take off \u201clike a rocket.\u201d",
      "But Trump has also highlighted another concern: If the Fed doesn't cut rates, the federal government will have to pay more interest on its huge budget deficits, which are projected to grow even larger under the White House's proposed tax and budget legislation currently being considered by the Senate.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to spend $600 billion a year, $600 billion because of one numbskull that sits here (and says), \u2018I don\u2019t see enough reason to cut the rates now,'\" Trump said last week.",
      "Pushing the Fed to cut rates simply to save the government on its interest payments typically raises alarms among economists, because it would threaten the Fed's congressional mandate to focus on stable prices and maximum employment.",
      "Yet the markets haven't reacted much to Trump's recent attacks on the Fed, now that the Supreme Court, in a ruling last month, suggested that a president doesn't have the legal power to fire the Fed chair.",
      "Still, with inflation remaining low, so far, despite the imposition of tariffs, the Fed may come under greater pressure in the coming months from economists and investors to cut rates. Policymakers estimate that the interest rate that would neither stimulate the economy nor slow it down \u2014 known as the \u201cneutral rate\u201d \u2014 is about 3%.",
      "Meanwhile, inflation \u2014 according to the Fed's preferred measure \u2014 is just 2.1%, almost back to the central bank's 2% target. Such a low reading suggests the Fed's rate should be closer to neutral, below its current level of 4.4%, because it doesn't need a high rate to slow inflation.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a reasonable case for the Fed to grapple with,\" said Jon Hilsenrath, a visiting scholar at Duke University.",
      "Yet according to a survey Hilsenrath conducted for Duke of former Fed officials and staff, they expect the Fed to cut interest rates just once this year. \u201cThere\u2019s a risk that inflation moves up and they don\u2019t want to get ahead of themselves,\u201d he said.",
      "It's possible that tariffs may not push up inflation as much as economists have feared. But one reason for that could be that the economy may slow, lifting unemployment and making consumers unwilling to pay higher prices, which would reduce inflation.",
      "Economists at Goldman Sachs said in a recent research note that they expect inflation will rise to 3.6% by December, but that the increase will only be temporary.",
      "\u201cThe main reason we are less worried is that we expect the economy to be weak this year, with ... a modest rise in the unemployment rate,\" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman, and his colleagues wrote.",
      "A noticeable weakening of the economy that slows consumer spending and holds down inflation would likely lead the Fed to quickly cut rates. But they will be more comfortable doing so once they have a better sense of the full impact of tariffs.",
      "Michael Gapen, chief U.S. economist at Morgan Stanley, said in a note Monday that the Fed \u201cwill need several months to assess the effects of policy changes, believing that \u2018later and correct is better than sooner and wrong.\u2019\u201d",

      "In 2005, Rebecca van Bergen was a graduate student in social work at Washington University when she won $24,000 in a school innovation contest",
      "In 2005, Rebecca van Bergen was a graduate student in social work at Washington University when she won $24,000 in a school innovation contest. That seed money sparked the creation of Nest Inc., a nonprofit that empowers women artisans globally by providing training, funding, and market access.",
      "From its modest beginnings, Nest has grown into a force in the artisan economy. It now supports creators in 125 countries and 47 U.S. states, helping women transition from informal craft work to sustainable business ownership. Nest\u2019s network includes around 3,000 handcraft businesses and has reached more than 345,000 entrepreneurs \u2014 mainly women \u2014 with grants and coaching on skills like pricing and financial management.",
      "\u201cMost people still have an aunt or grandmother who knits or crochets or made them clothes,\u201d van Bergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty deeply embedded in our societies. It\u2019s income-generating, and it also preserves cultures.\u201d",
      "Van Bergen\u2019s first break came in 2010 when Nest partnered with FEED Projects, fashion designer Lauren Bush\u2019s social enterprise. That relationship opened doors to collaborations with Amazon, Etsy, and West Elm. Over the years, Nest\u2019s mission has attracted support from funders like the Oak and Moody\u2019s foundations \u2014 as well retailers like Tory Burch and L.L.Bean, now totaling 25 companies, which purchase and sell the artists\u2019 goods.",
      "From an initial team of two, Nest has grown to 33 staff members, with net assets of $6 million and annual revenue of $7.2 million in 2025 \u2014 nearly double its 2019 revenue. It doesn\u2019t take a cut of artisan sales, relying instead on grants, program service revenue, fundraising events, and individual donations. The organization has received more than $10 million in grant funding since 2017, according to tax information from Cause IQ, which collects nonprofit data.",
      "In recent years, Nest has expanded domestically, providing funds and training artists in all but three U.S. states.",
      "Among the artisans is Stef Ratliff, who was born and raised in the coalfields of eastern Kentucky. She creates custom pottery and art through her KYARTRAT business. Though she had painted trophies for the Americana Music Awards for more than a decade \u2014 and created a custom guitar for Grace Bowers at this year\u2019s Grammys \u2014 Ratliff struggled to run a sustainable business until joining Nest and working as a community manager identifying Appalachian artists.",
      "\u201cI did a business consultation program with them (that) focused on marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt taught me I can make the greatest pot or painting of all time, but if I don\u2019t present them in the right light, no one is going to see them properly.\u201d",
      "Working with Nest and connecting to Etsy through a joint program called Uplift Makers was fundamental to setting up an Etsy shop for KYARTRAT, Ratliff said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re all reaching new customers through Etsy,\u201d she said, referring to Nest\u2019s eastern Kentucky group of 100 artisans.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s huge for Appalachia,\u201d Ratliff said. \u201cI would never have thought to sell my pottery through Etsy because I felt like a lot of people don\u2019t really care about southern stories and Appalachian stories. I didn\u2019t think they really cared about history.\u201d",
      "Nest\u2019s mission is rooted in van Bergen\u2019s own experience watching her grandmother and great-grandmother sew and quilt. The organization focuses on traditional crafts like basket weaving, ceramics, and candle-making, which are both income-generating and culturally meaningful.",
      "Globally, the handcraft market is valued at $906.8 billion and a vital source of employment, especially for women, according to the data service Research and Markets. Nest helps artisans tap into this market by connecting them to brands like GAP, Ralph Lauren, Target, and Amazon.",
      "In 2021, Nest partnered with Etsy to launch the Uplift Makers Program to support six heritage craft communities, including Gullah basket weavers from South Carolina, quilt makers from the Gee\u2019s Bend area of Alabama\u2019s rural Black Belt region, Afghan refugee craft business owners throughout the United States, Indigenous artisans from the United States and Canada, artisans from Oaxaca, Mexico, and craft makers from Appalachia.",
      "Etsy supported the Gee\u2019s Bend quilters with a $50,000 grant and has since helped over 140 U.S. artisans generate more than $1 million in sales.",
      "Recently, Nest received a $300,000 grant from the Mastercard Impact Fund to bolster its work with Appalachian artisans.",
      "Nest has adapted to economic shifts and policy changes over the years. During the pandemic, it prioritized financial literacy and business development. Now, it\u2019s monitoring global trade policies \u2014 like tariffs \u2014 that could affect both artists and their retail partners.",
      "Nest intentionally chose not to pursue microlending, which was popular among development groups in the early 2000s but sometimes left borrowers in debt. Instead, the organization focuses on partnerships with groups like Indego Africa, which works with over 700 artisans in Ghana and Rwanda. That partnership has helped connect Ghanaian craftswomen to retailers like Tory Burch, which sells their hand-woven straw tote bags for close to $500.",
      "\u201cThose partnerships are super valuable, both to us and to our partners, because the size of those orders tends to be quite large. It could be anywhere from 300 items to 1,500 items,\u201d said Sara Wohlers, Indego Africa\u2019s director of marketing and communications. \u201cThat creates a lot of consistent work for our partners, and consistent income.\u201d",
      "As Nest shifts to more U.S.-focused work, it is helping women who face similar economic barriers.",
      "Among them is Cynthia Main, a Kentucky-based woodworker who has participated in Nest\u2019s Makers Future Fund, a program that provides professional coaching with a $5,000 grant. Main owns Sunhouse Craft, where she sells handmade brooms, dustpans, and other goods. Despite Berea\u2019s status as Kentucky\u2019s folk arts capital, its economy has suffered from industrial closures and persistent poverty \u2014 nearly 1 in 5 residents lives below the poverty line.",
      "Main said Nest helped her overcome many financial and retail obstacles and build a broader client base for her products. She used her $5,000 grant to attend her first wholesale trade show in New York. That exposure helped double her company\u2019s annual profits, from $120,000 to more than $240,000.",
      "\u201cI just think the work that Nest is doing is so important,\u201d Main said. \u201cI can\u2019t stress enough how being in a rural place, there\u2019s not a lot of help, or a lot of people who understand the uniqueness of a handmade business, and their advice has been so spot on.\u201d",

      "Lauder, the oldest son of Estee and Joseph H. Lauder, who founded the company in 1946, formally joined the New York business in 1958. Over more than six decades, Lauder played a key role in transforming the business from a handful of products sold under a single brand in U.S. stores to a multi-brand global giant. He had held the title of chairman emeritus at the time of his death.",
      "Estee Lauder's products are sold in roughly 150 countries and territories under brand names including Clinique and Aveda, according to the company's latest annual report. The company generated sales of nearly $16 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the filing said.",
      "Estee Lauder went public in 1995, but members of Lauder family still have about 84% of the voting power of common stock, according to the latest annual filing.",
      "Lauder served as president of The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos. from 1972 to 1995 and as CEO from 1982 through 1999. He was named chairman in 1995 and served in that role through June 2009.",
      "Under his stewardship, Lauder created the company\u2019s first research and development laboratory, brought in professional management at every level, and was the impetus behind The Est\u00e9e Lauder Cos.\u2019 international expansion, helping to spearhead the company\u2019s sales and profits exponentially, according to the company.",
      "Lauder led the launch of many brands including Aramis, Clinique, and Lab Series, among others. Until his death, he remained deeply involved in the company\u2019s acquisition strategy, including the acquisitions of such brands as Aveda, Bobbi Brown, Jo Malone London and MAC, the company said.",
      "During his years as chairman emeritus, Lauder was closely involved in the business and day-to-day operations and was a constant fixture at its global headquarters in New York and at its stores around the world until the time of his death, the company said.",
      "\u201cThroughout his life, my father worked tirelessly to build and transform the beauty industry, pioneering many of the innovations, trends, and best practices that are foundational to the industry today,\u201d said William P. Lauder, son and chair of the board at The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies in a statement. \u201cHe was the most charitable man I have ever known, believing that art and education belonged to everyone, and championing the fight against diseases such as Alzheimer\u2019s and breast cancer. \u201d",
      "Lauder was a longtime patron of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, in 2013, pledged his 78-piece collection of Cubist art to the museum in the largest single philanthropic gift in the museum's history. He later added five major works to that pledged gift, the company said.",
      "In concert with his Cubist collection donation, he helped establish the Leonard A. Lauder Research Center for Modern Art at the Met to support a program of fellowships, focused exhibitions, and public lectures. He also was the Whitney Museum of American Art\u2019s chairman emeritus and a trustee from 1977 to 2011.",

      "A judge in Mali has placed Canadian mining company Barrick Gold under provisional administration in an ongoing dispute with the military government over alleged unpaid taxes",
      "BAMAKO, Mali -- A judge in Mali on Monday ordered Barrick Gold's Loulo-Gounkoto gold complex to be placed under provisional administration for six months in an ongoing dispute between the Canadian mining company and the West African nation's military government over unpaid taxes.",
      "Zoumana Makadji, an accountant and a former Malian minister of health has been appointed as the company's provisional administrator within 15 days, Judge Issa Aguibou Diallo said in a statement to Barrick\u2019s lawyers.",
      "Barrick's website said the company is Africa\u2019s largest gold producer through its Loulo-Gounkoto complex and Kibali mine located in Congo.",
      "Barrick Gold has been in conflict with Mali's military rulers over alleged unpaid taxes and unfair contracts with past governments. The dispute culminated in an arrest warrant in December for Barrick CEO Mark Bristow and the company\u2019s offer to pay $370 million to the government.",
      "\u201cWhile Barrick\u2019s subsidiaries remain the legal owners of the mine, operational control has been transferred to an external administrator,\u201d Barrick said in a statement on its website following the ruling.",
      "In December, Barrick submitted a request for arbitration to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes to address disagreements with Mali concerning the Loulo-Gounkoto complex, where the mines are located.",
      "Despite this, the government took a series of escalatory measures, including the arrest of Barrick Gold employees, who remain detained, and the suspension of gold exports.",
      "Barrick, which has been present in Mali for three decades, emphasized that the arbitration process was still ongoing and reaffirmed its commitment to \u201cengaging with the government of Mali, in parallel, to identify a constructive, mutually acceptable solution.\u201d",
      "The company's statement on Monday added: \"The ongoing detention of (our) employees \u2014 who remain unjustly imprisoned and used as leverage in this process \u2014 is deeply concerning and inconsistent with the trust, transparency and accountability required for a genuine long-term partnership.",
      "\u201cTo date, no credible rationale has been presented to justify this detention and the Government\u2019s position, and the Government\u2019s ever-increasing demands have lacked both factual and legal foundation.\u201d",
      "Mali is one of Africa\u2019s leading gold producers, but it has struggled for years with jihadi violence and high levels of poverty and hunger. The military seized power in 2020, and the government has placed foreign mining companies under growing pressure as it seeks to shore up revenues.",
      "In November, the CEO of Australian company Resolute Mining and two employees were arrested in Bamako. They were released after the company paid $80 million to Malian authorities to resolve a tax dispute and promised to pay a further $80 million in the coming months.",

      "The humble water gun \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 has become the weapon of choice and symbol of Spain's anti-tourism protests",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",
      "\u201cI still like Barcelona,\" she said. \"I have met a lot of people who were kind.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The tariffs wars involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park",
      "NEW YORK -- The trade disputes involving global economic powerhouses such as the U.S. and China are being felt even in such distinctly local places as your regional amusement park.",
      "Families who balk at the cost of a summer vacation at big amusement parks like Disney World favor trips to regional parks, which typically are within driving distance, so expensive flights aren\u2019t necessary. But if tariffs lead to economic uncertainty, they may just stay home.",
      "For park owners, tariffs could subject them to extra costs that their customers might not think about. Parts of the rides are made of imported steel that\u2019s currently subject to tariffs. Those prizes and toys people win after they shoot basketballs into a hoop? They usually come from China, which has been subject to varying tariffs.",
      "So far this year, however, there\u2019s been no letdown.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had good crowds, and everyone seems excited to be here,\u201d said Brian Hartley, vice president of Playland\u2019s Castaway Cove, in Ocean City, New Jersey, which boasts 30 rides, miniature golf, go-karts, and other beachfront attractions. \u201cAs long as the weather is good, they\u2019re ready to come down.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s true for park-goer Chris Del Borrello, at Castaway Cove on a bustling June Friday evening with a group of 10 family members, including his four children.",
      "\u201cWe come here every year because it\u2019s so fun, and we build memories every single summer,\u201d he said.",
      "Tariffs loom over the summer tourism industry just as leisure travel is expected to finally get back to prepandemic levels. The U.S. Travel Association expects Americans to take 1.96 billion trips expected this year, up 2% from 1.92 billion last year. Travel spending is also expected to increase 2% year over year.",
      "As park operators prepared for the 2025 summer last year, President Donald Trump unrolled on-again, off-again tariffs against U.S. trade partners that made planning difficult. For instance, proposed tariffs against China started at 10% in February, rose to 20% in March, ballooned to 145% in April, and were reduced to 30% in May. On Wednesday, the Trump administration put the number at 55%.",
      "Hartley said he ordered items like stuffed animals for games from China early to beat the tariffs \u2013 and benefitted from the pause announced in May.",
      "\u201cWe loaded up, we\u2019re tripping over stuff at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tried to purchase as much stuff as we could to be ready for the season, because that little bit makes a big difference in the bottom line at the end of the day,\u201d he said.",
      "In particular, the park added two new rides this year, but parts were delivered back in the fall.",
      "Not all parks were as fortunate. At Adventureland, in Farmingdale, N.Y., the steel structure for a new ride, Wave Twister, and some China-made game prizes like plush toys and basketballs were affected by tariff costs, said manager Jeanine Gentile.",
      "\u201cWe ordered them months ago before the tariffs were in place, but they typically arrive for delivery at this time of the year, and so obviously the tariffs were in before we received the product,\u201d she said. \u201cWe did have to pay additional for those tariffs in order to get the product.\u201d",
      "So far, the park is absorbing the cost \u2013 they made the decision not to raise ticket prices this year. But that could change next year.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve just sort of felt that if we can do this (not raise prices) for Long Island and for our guests let\u2019s do it, where we can afford it, at least for this season,\u201d said Gentile.",
      "Aside from tariffs, economic uncertainty is the biggest challenge for amusement parks this season.",
      "At Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, which is co-owned by country legend Dolly Parton and Herschend Family Entertainment, Director of Communications Pete Owens said they decided to open a week later in March due to concerns about the economy. But so far, attendance at the park, nestled in the Great Smoky Mountains, is up 4% from last year. Attendees are spending but looking for deals.",
      "A promotion giving discount tickets to public employees has proved popular. And Owens is seeing customers purchase tickets for their family closer to their actual visit instead of several days or weeks in advance. Some are even waiting until they\u2019re in the Great Smoky Mountains to decide to buy a ticket.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re all still looking very closely to see what value pricing there is or what opportunities there are,\u201d he said.",
      "The same holds true at Silver Dollar City near Branson, Missouri, an 1880s Western-themed park, which draws its visitors from what president Brad Thomas calls \u201cAmerica\u2019s heartland,\u201d an \u201coval\u201d in the middle of the country, including Minneapolis, Denver and Memphis and Houston, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat those families tend to say as they visit us is that they want their families just to escape, even though there\u2019s a lot of concerns in every family\u2019s life, they\u2019re all dealing with time pressure and money pressure and inflation pressure and all kinds of other things,\u201d said Thomas.",
      "He said this year families coming to the park are sticking to a plan, moneywise.",
      "\u201cThey have carved the money that they\u2019ll spend in their day with us or their days with us,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve planned that into their budget.\u201d",
      "Back at Castaway Cove, Hartley said that while the season is going well, he worries about the mood of the consumer as economic uncertainty persists. That could affect trip planning later in the summer.",
      "\u201cPeople that really haven\u2019t already booked a vacation \u2026 it may affect, do they come down here for a weekend? Do they not? Do they come for two days instead of four or five days?\u201d he said. \u201cI think people don\u2019t know what the future is going to hold.\u201d",

      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",
      "In Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city\u2019s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.",
      "\u201cThere were quite a few sponsors who pulled back their investments or let us know they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be in a position to support this year,\" said Harris, who has overseen the event for more than a decade.",
      "The festival, which takes place in the historically Black Five Points neighborhood, has been scaled back to one day instead of two because of the budget shortfall. It has only been able to stay afloat thanks to donations from individuals and foundations.",
      "\u201cThankfully, there was a wide range of support that came when we made the announcement that the celebration is in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said.",

      "No-bid contracts with politically connected companies have become crucial to the Republican Trump administration\u2019s push for more space to hold immigrants for deportation",
      "LEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- LEAVENWORTH, Kan. (AP) \u2014 Leavenworth, Kansas, occupies a mythic space in American crime, its name alone evoking a short hand for serving hard time. The federal penitentiary housed gangsters Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly \u2014 in a building so storied that it inspired the term \u201cthe big house.\u201d",
      "Now Kansas\u2019 oldest city could soon be detaining far less famous people, migrants swept up in President Donald Trump\u2019s promise of mass deportations of those living in the U.S. illegally.",
      "The federal government has signed a deal with the private prison firm CoreCivic Corp. to reopen a 1,033-bed prison in Leavenworth as part of a surge of contracts U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has issued without seeking competitive bids.",
      "ICE has cited a \u201ccompelling urgency\u201d for thousands more detention beds, and its efforts have sent profit estimates soaring for politically connected private companies, including CoreCivic, based in the Nashville, Tennessee, area and another giant firm, The Geo Group Inc., headquartered in southern Florida.",
      "That push faces resistance. Leavenworth filed a lawsuit against CoreCivic after it tried to reopen without city officials signing off on the deal, quoting a federal judge\u2019s past description of the now-shuttered prison as \u201ca hell hole.\" The case in Leavenworth serves as another test of the limits of the Republican president's unusually aggressive tactics to force migrant removals.",
      "To get more detention beds, the Trump administration has modified dozens of existing agreements with contractors and used no-bid contracts. One pays $73 million to a company led by former federal immigration officials for \u201cimmigration enforcement support teams\u201d to handle administrative tasks, such as helping coordinate removals, triaging complaints or telling ICE if someone is a risk to community safety.",
      "Just last week , Geo Group announced that ICE modified a contract for an existing detention center in southeastern Georgia so that the company could reopen an idle prison on adjacent land to hold 1,868 migrants \u2014 and earn $66 million in annual revenue.",
      "\u201cNever in our 42-year company history have we had so much activity and demand for our services as we are seeing right now,\u201d said CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger during an earnings call last month with shareholders.",
      "A tax-cutting and budget reconciliation measure approved last month by the House includes $45 billion over four years for immigrant detention, a threefold spending increase. The Senate is now considering that legislation.",
      "When Trump started his second term in January, CoreCivic and Geo had around 20 idle facilities, partly because of sentencing reforms that reduced prison populations. But the Trump administration wants to more than double the existing 41,000 beds for detaining migrants to at least 100,000 beds and \u2014 if private prison executives' predictions are accurate \u2014 possibly to more than 150,000.",
      "ICE declared a national emergency on the U.S. border with Mexico as part of its justification for authorizing nine five-year contracts for a combined 10,312 beds without \u201cFull and Open Competition.\u201d",
      "Only three of the nine potential facilities were listed in ICE\u2019s document: Leavenworth, a 2,560-bed CoreCivic-owned facility in California City, California, and an 1,800-bed Geo-owned prison in Baldwin, Michigan.",
      "The agreement for the Leavenworth facility hasn\u2019t been released, nor have documents for the other two sites. CoreCivic and Geo Group officials said last month on earnings calls that ICE used what are known as letter contracts, meant to speed things up when time is critical.",
      "Charles Tiefer, a contract expert and professor emeritus of law at the University of Baltimore Law School, said letter contracts normally are reserved for minor matters, not the big changes he sees ICE making to previous agreements.",
      "\u201cI think that a letter contract is a pathetic way to make big important contracts,\u201d he said.",
      "CoreCivic's Leavenworth facility quickly became a priority for ICE and the company because of its central location. Leavenworth, with 37,000 residents, is only 10 miles (16 kilometers) to the west of the Kansas City International Airport. The facility would hold men and women and is within ICE\u2019s area of operations for Chicago, 420 miles (676 kilometers) to the northeast.",
      "\u201cThat would mean that people targeted in the Chicago area and in Illinois would end up going to this facility down in Kansas,\u201d said Jesse Franzblau, a senior policy analyst for the National Immigrant Justice Center.",
      "Prisons have long been an important part of Leavenworth's economy, employing hundreds of workers to guard prisoners held in two military facilities, the nation\u2019s first federal penitentiary, a Kansas correctional facility and a county jail within 6 miles (10 kilometers) of city hall.",
      "The Leavenworth area's politics might have been expected to help CoreCivic. Trump carried its county by more than 20 percentage points in each of his three campaigns for president.",
      "But skeptical city officials argue that CoreCivic needs a special use permit to reopen its facility. CoreCivic disagrees, saying that it doesn't because it never abandoned the facility and that the permitting process would take too long. Leavenworth sued the company to force it to get one, and a state-court judge last week issued an order requiring it.",
      "An attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said the legal fight indicates how much ill will CoreCivic generated when it held criminal suspects there for trials in federal court for the U.S. Marshals Service.",
      "In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees in its Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden, a Democrat, called on the U.S. Department of Justice to curb the use of private prisons. In the months before the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders detailed stabbings, suicides, a homicide and inmate rights violations in a letter to the White House. CoreCivic responded at the time that the claims were \u201cfalse and defamatory.\u201d",
      "Vacancies among correctional officers were as high as 23%, according to a Department of Justice report from 2017.",
      "\u201cIt was just mayhem,\u201d recalled William Rogers, who worked as a guard at the CoreCivic facility in Leavenworth from 2016 through 2020. He said repeated assaults sent him to the emergency room three times, including once after a blow to the head that required 14 staples.",
      "When Leavenworth sued CoreCivic, it opened its lawsuit with a quote from U.S. District Court Judge Julie Robinson \u2014 an appointee of President George W. Bush, a Republican \u2014 who said of the prison: \u201cThe only way I could describe it frankly, what\u2019s going on at CoreCivic right now is it\u2019s an absolute hell hole.\u201d",
      "The city\u2019s lawsuit described detainees locked in showers as punishment. It said that sheets and towels from the facility clogged up the wastewater system and that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes.",
      "The facility had no inmates when CoreCivic gave reporters a tour earlier this year, and it looked scrubbed top to bottom and the smell of disinfectant hung in the air. One unit for inmates had a painting on one wall featuring a covered wagon.",
      "During the tour, when asked about the allegations of past problems, Misty Mackey, a longtime CoreCivic employee who was tapped to serve as warden there, apologized for past employees' experiences and said the company officials \u201cdo our best to make sure that we learn from different situations.\u201d",
      "Besides CoreCivic\u2019s Leavenworth prison, other once-shuttered facilities could come online near major immigrant population centers, from New York to Los Angeles, to help Trump fulfill his deportation plans.",
      "ICE wants to reopen existing facilities because it\u2019s faster than building new ones, said Marcela Hernandez, the organizing director for the Detention Watch Network, which has organized nationwide protests against ICE detention.",
      "Counties often lease out jail space for immigrant detention, but ICE said some jurisdictions have passed ordinances barring that.",
      "ICE has used contract modifications to reopen shuttered lockups like the 1,000-bed Delaney Hall Facility in Newark, New Jersey, and a 2,500-bed facility in Dilley, Texas, offering no explanations why new, competitively bid contracts weren't sought.",
      "The Newark facility, with its own history of problems, resumed intakes May 1, and disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night. Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, a Democrat who previously was arrested there and accused of trespassing, cited reports of a possible uprising, and the Department of Homeland Security confirmed four escapes.",
      "The contract modification for Dilley, which was built to hold families and resumed operations in March, calls its units \u201cneighborhoods\u201d and gives them names like Brown Bear and Blue Butterfly.",
      "The financial details for the Newark and Dilley contract modifications are blacked out in online copies, as they for more than 50 other agreements ICE has signed since Trump took office. ICE didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Private prison executives are forecasting hundreds of millions of dollars in new ICE profits. Since Trump\u2019s reelection in November, CoreCivic\u2019s stock has risen in price by 56% and Geo\u2019s by 73%.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the gold rush,\u201d Michael A. Hallett, a professor of criminal justice at the University of North Florida who studies private prisons. \u201cAll of a sudden, demand is spiraling. And when you\u2019re the only provider that can meet demand, you can pretty much set your terms.\u201d",
      "Geo's former lobbyist Pam Bondi is now the U.S. attorney general. It anticipates that all of its idle prisons will be activated this year, its executive chairman, George Zoley, told shareholders.",
      "CoreCivic, which along with Geo donated millions of dollars to largely GOP candidates at all levels of government and national political groups, is equally optimistic. It began daily talks with the Trump administration immediately after the election in November, said Hininger.",
      "CoreCivic officials said ICE's letter contracts provide initial funding to begin reopening facilities while the company negotiates a longer-term deal. The Leavenworth deal is worth $4.2 million a month to the company, it disclosed in a court filing.",
      "Tiefer, who served on an independent commission established to study government contracting for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, said ICE is \"placing a very dicey long-term bet\u201d because of its past problems and said ICE is giving CoreCivic \u201cthe keys to the treasury\u201d without competition.",
      "But financial analysts on company earnings calls have been delighted. When CoreCivic announced its letter contracts, Joe Gomes, of the financial services firm Noble Capital Markets, responded with, \u201cGreat news.\"",
      "\u201cAre you hiding any more of them on us?\u201d he asked.",

      "BANGKOK -- China's economy managed a mixed economic performance in May, as retail sales jumped while factory output slowed in the face of higher U.S. tariffs.",
      "Data released Monday showed retail sales rose 6.4% from a year earlier, helped partly by promotions of products stranded as shipments were suspended due to higher tariffs.",
      "A major online shopping festival also helped entice consumers to spend more. The June 18 shopping extravaganza started last month, with online sellers offering discounts on many products.",

      "Manufacturing output rose 5.8% in May year-on-year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, compared with 6.1% in April and 7.7% in March. Factory activity surged earlier in the year but has slowed as U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs took effect.",
      "China earlier reported its exports to the United States fell 35% in May from a year earlier, while total exports rose 4.8% in May from a year earlier, much lower than economists\u2019 forecasts and down sharply from an 8.1% jump in April.",
      "Overall, economists said the world\u2019s second largest economy had weathered the threat of hikes in tariffs relatively well.",
      "But signs of weakness persist as a slump in the property market has yet to reverse.",
      "Deflation remains an issue, with consumer prices slipping 0.1% in May from a year earlier and 0.2% from the month before.",
      "Investment in real estate fell 10.7% in January-May compared to a year earlier, with housing prices in most cities falling slightly, the report showed.",
      "Spending on factory equipment and other fixed assets rose at a relatively slow 3.7% annual pace, it said.",
      "Apart from the \u201c618\u201d online shopping festival timed to celebrate the June 18, 1998, founding of e-commerce giant JD.com, China\u2019s program to subsidize trade-ins of household appliances, autos and other goods helped boost retail sales.",

      "Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection",
      "NEW YORK -- Millions of Americans are seeing their credit scores suffer now that the U.S. government has resumed referring missed student loan payments for debt collection.",
      "After 90 days of non-payment, student loan servicers report delinquent, or past-due, accounts to major credit bureaus, which use the information to recalculate the borrower's score. Falling behind on loan payments therefore can affect an individual\u2019s credit rating as severely as filing for personal bankruptcy.",
      "A lower credit score makes it harder or more expensive to obtain car loans, mortgages, credit cards, auto insurance and other financial services at a time when inflation, high interest rates, and layoffs have strained the resources of some consumers.",
      "The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that in the first three months of 2025, 2.2 million student loan recipients saw their scores drop by 100 points, and an additional 1 million had drops of 150 points or more.",
      "Declines that steep may mean the difference between a manageable credit card interest rate and an unmanageable one, or approval or rejection of an application to rent an apartment.",
      "The U.S. Department of Education paused federal student loan payments in March 2020, offering borrowers relief during the economic chaos of the coronavirus pandemic.",
      "Though payments technically resumed in 2023, the Biden administration provided a one-year grace period that ended in October 2024. Last month, the Trump administration restarted the collection process for outstanding student loans, with plans to seize wages and tax refunds if the loans continue to go unpaid.",
      "According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, about 1 in 4 people with student loan accounts were more than 90 days behind on payments at the end of March.",
      "Kat Hanchon, 33, who works in marketing and higher education in Detroit, was one of them. Hanchon said her score dropped by 57 points as a result of her loans falling delinquent this year. That put her score below 600, or subprime.",
      "When Hanchon received her statement from her loan servicer, her expected monthly payments were higher than before the pandemic-era pause, even though she had enrolled in a repayment plan that takes a borrower's full financial situation into account.",
      "\u201cThey said I now have to pay $358 per month,\" she said. \"I'm not going to be able to pay that. ... But I'm not unusual in the world we're living in right now.\"",
      "Hanchon said she's had to prioritize paying medical expenses \u2014 for a dental crown, a root canal, and an endoscopy \u2014 before she'll be able to consider putting money toward the loans. While her housing situation is secure for the moment, she worries about the annual percentage rate for her credit cards fluctuating.",
      "Lenders, landlords, credit card companies, employers and utility companies all look to consumers\u2019 credit scores to gauge the likelihood of borrowers being able to make regular payments. A higher score typically results in lower interest rates and more favorable loan terms, while a lower score makes it harder to access credit.",
      "The Education Department has said borrowers should receive bills from lenders three weeks before any payments are due, but some people have reported that they have not been notified.",
      "Wait times for calls with loan servicers have been high, and layoffs at the Department of Education have also likely contributed to delayed service, consumer advocates say.",
      "Dom Holmes, 28, who works for a nonprofit in Manheim, Pennsylvania, said he woke up in early May to find his credit score had dropped 60 or 70 points overnight.",
      "\u201cAll of a sudden I was delinquent, even though I\u2019d never received notice,\u201d he said.",
      "Holmes has begun the process of appealing the reduction of his credit score, he said. He's been considering a move for professional reasons, and added that he's concerned it could be tough to rent a place to live with his score as it stands.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m at the ideal age where I should be starting a family and buying a home,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you destroy me financially, what are the chances I\u2019m able to do that and that\u2019s viable for me?\u201d",
      "Holmes, who was the first person in his family to graduate from college, said he still has some outstanding Parent Plus loans, which he intends to keep paying down so that his parents\u2019 credit scores aren\u2019t affected.",
      "He graduated in 2019, shortly before the pandemic, and said he can see how his generation might have difficulty paying off the debt.",
      "\u201cRight as I was entering the workforce, the world really stopped,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cThings were really bad for a lot of people for a long time. We\u2019re still coming out of that. And all of a sudden, the switches got turned back on overnight.\u201d",
      "Kevin King, vice president of credit risk at data and analytics company LexisNexis, said he expects the effects of the resumed student loan collections to begin rippling through the U.S. economy in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere were a number of years where it was probably a bad financial strategy to be making student loan payments,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of consumers were confused as various government (policies of forgiveness) were passed and overruled.\u201d",
      "King predicts that student loan payments will move higher in the so-called \u201cpayment hierarchy,\u201d or the order in which consumers make payments, since the government plans to use \u201clevers to compel\" such as wage garnishment and the seizing of tax refunds.",
      "\u201cWhich bill do you pay first, second, and not at all?\u201d King said. \u201cHistorically, student loans are really far down the list. But the government\u2019s being pretty aggressive here in pursuing payment activity in a way that may shift the hierarchy. Consumers might be more willing to go delinquent or default on something like a credit card or installment loan.\u201d",
      "The Federal Reserve of New York study also found that borrowers ages 40 and older were most likely to be delinquent on their loans.",
      "Andrew McCall, 58, of Boise, Idaho, said he has about $30,000 remaining in outstanding loans from earning his computer science degrees. He said he can't afford his monthly payments, which are in the $250-300 range, and worries what a hit to his credit score might mean for all areas of his life.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this economy is driven by debt to begin with causes my score to be paramount no matter what financial decisions I\u2019m making, outside of going to the grocery store,\u201d he said. \u201cMy car, my house... Your credit rating becomes a social stratifier.\u201d",

They say consumers plan to spend an average of $199.38 on their dads and father figures this year.",

      "Water guns are back squirting at unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Protesters used water guns against unsuspecting tourists in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca on Sunday as demonstrators marched to demand a rethink of an economic model they believe is fueling a housing crunch and erasing the character of their hometowns.",
      "The marches were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\u201cThe squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\u201d Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \u201cBarcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\u201d",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed\u2019s La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \u201cbubble tea\u201d spots.",
      "\u201cOur lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\u201d",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \u201cEverywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\u201d The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination\u2019s historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident.\u201d They stuck stickers saying \u201cCitizen Self-Defense,\u201d in Catalan, and \u201cTourist Go Home,\u201d in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel\u2019s doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona\u2019s main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but she said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees Celsius) weather.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s lovely, thank you sweetheart,\u201d Wanda said to the squirter. \u201cI am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\u201d",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain\u2019s capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \u201cGet Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\u201d",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain\u2019s government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \u201cYour Airbnb was my home.\u201d",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb\u2019s general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn\u2019t trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn\u2019t resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn\u2019t just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\u201cIn the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\u201d he said.",

      "Given the way Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton was limping on his way out of the postgame news conference after Game 5 of the NBA Finals, it\u2019s safe to assume he\u2019s a fan of the schedule right about now",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- Given the way Indiana guard Tyrese Haliburton was limping on his way out of the postgame news conference after Game 5 of the NBA Finals, it's safe to assume he's a fan of the schedule right about now.",
      "Put simply, he could use a couple of days off \u2014 at least.",
      "Haliburton has a lower leg injury \u2014 nobody's saying exactly what it is, whether it's ankle or calf or something else \u2014 and it seems to be the sort that if this were a back-to-back situation in December, he'd be missing at least one game. But these are the finals, this is June, there no back-to-backs in the playoffs and when the league gets to the last series two-day breaks between games aren't uncommon.",
      "Amen to that, the Pacers are probably saying right about now.",
      "\u201cThe Finals, the NBA Finals, is one of the great stages in all of sports,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cAnd so, it shouldn\u2019t happen quickly and abruptly. It should happen at the right pace and the right tempo, and the space in between games does help player health. That's a very important aspect of it.\u201d",
      "There was a one-day gap between games in this year's finals just once, separating Games 3 and 4 in Indianapolis. Everything else has seen a two-day gap, as will be the case going into Game 6 at Indy on Thursday night. And if the Pacers win to force a Game 7 back in Oklahoma City, that'll be preceded by another two days off going into an ultimate game on Sunday night.",
      "It should be noted that the Thunder don't mind the schedule being drawn out, either.",
      "\u201cWe recover,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cThe finals are great because you get extra time in between the games. I think that\u2019s huge in terms of rest and recovery at this time of the year. I think it\u2019s good for the product. I think it\u2019s a good thing and by the time the ball goes up in the air, everybody is going to be ready to play and everybody is going to be excited.\u201d",
      "Even those who aren't dealing with an injury seem to be welcoming the two-day gaps between finals games.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of games. It\u2019s tiring, for sure,\u201d Thunder star and league MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cBut every game is tiring. When you\u2019re giving your all, every possession, you\u2019re going to be tired. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m the only one out there that is tired.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t always like this.",
      "The first NBA Finals were in 1947, before the league was called the NBA (it was the Basketball Association of America then) and before the title round was called the finals (after being called the BAA Finals in the early years, it was called the NBA World Championship Series until the mid-1980s).",
      "That first year, Philadelphia and Chicago played five games in seven days. It would be unthinkable to play at that pace now; the NBA, for much of the last decade, hasn't even scheduled stretches like that in the regular season.",
      "The finals between Minneapolis and New York did the same thing \u2014 five games, seven days \u2014 in 1953. Boston and the Los Angeles Lakers played a five-game series in an eight-day span in 1965. Golden State and Washington played four games in eight days in 1975, with two cross-country flights in there as well. And this was long before charter flights became the rule in the NBA, too.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re fortunate in this series. Travel is pretty reasonable. Not a long distance,\u201d Carlisle said, evidently aware that the finals has the shortest distance between the dueling cities \u2014 Oklahoma City and Indianapolis are separated by 688 miles by air \u2014 than any finals matchup since 1956. \u201cNot a long flight. I do believe it\u2019s a better circumstance for the overall integrity of the competition.\u201d",
      "The two extra days gives everybody \u2014 Haliburton, coaches, everyone \u2014 more time to get ready. Daigneault, the father of kids ages 3 and 2, said it gives him more time to be a dad between games.",
      "\u201cI do twice as much parenting,\u201d he said, \u201cnot twice as much work.\u201d",
      "Carlisle said coaches get more time to study film, though at this point in the series it's pretty clear that the Thunder and Pacers know each other about as well as they can. And Haliburton will get another 24 hours of whatever scheme the Pacers' medical staff draws up to try to get his leg good to go in Game 6.",
      "\u201cAll these guys playing in this series on both sides. I think it\u2019s pretty clear now that we\u2019re going into the sixth game, and all attention and the crowd noise in both arenas, everything, this is a lifetime opportunity,\u201d Carlisle said. \u201cNot many guys are going to sit, even if they are a little banged up.\u201d",

      "Those are among the high-wattage pairs on Tuesday\u2019s preliminary entry list for the reimagined U.S. Open mixed doubles tournament on Aug. 19-20, before singles competition begins Aug. 24.",
      "Ten of the top 11 women in the WTA singles rankings \u2014 Coco Gauff, who just won the French Open for her second Grand Slam title, is the only one missing \u2014 and 10 of the top 11 men on the ATP tour, including No. 1 Jannik Sinner and 24-time major champion Novak Djokovic, have registered to compete for the $1 million top prize that will be split by the winners, an $800,000 increase over last year.",

      "It\u2019s a star-studded group that is a far cry from the mix of doubles specialists usually found in a Grand Slam mixed doubles bracket. Some criticized the changes when they were announced in February, with Errani and Vavassori calling the new format a \u201cpseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show\u201d that would shut out doubles players.",

      "The mixed doubles event is shrinking from 32 pairs to 16, and there is a shortened format \u2014 first-to-four-games sets until the final; no-ad scoring; match tiebreakers instead of a third set.",
      "Players still have time to sign up before the July 28 cutoff, and there is no guarantee that the 16 teams announced Tuesday will actually be in the draw in New York. The top eight teams based on their combined singles ranking will automatically get into the field; the other eight pairings will receive wild cards determined by a USTA committee.",
      "\u201cOnce there was an understanding of what the event was, (players) went and ran with it,\u201d said Eric Butorac, USTA senior director of player relations and business development. \u201cThey found their own partners \u2014 whether it was a friendship, a countryman or some even teaming up with a partner that they have off the court.\u201d",

      "Since opening night of their title defense, the Panthers have won 32 of 50 games at their arena on the edge of the Everglades. Their NHL-record-tying success of winning 10 on the road this playoffs has allowed them the opportunity to close out the Oilers at home.",

    "story": [
      "Rebecca Lobo and Jen Rizzotti have spent the last few years coaching the AAU team that their sons play for",
      "SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Rebecca Lobo had just finished broadcasting Caitlin Clark and the Indiana Fever's nationally televised victory over the New York Liberty last month when she rushed to the airport to catch a flight back home to Connecticut.",
      "She had another game the next day\u2014 and she was coaching in this one.",
      "Lobo has been coaching her son, Thomas, on his AAU team since he was in the seventh grade. That team, CT Force, was playing in the second day of a tournament in Springfield, Massachusetts, close to where the Hall of Famer grew up.",
      "But even if travel delays prevented her from getting there, Lobo wasn't worried. She knew Jen Rizzotti would be.",
      "The two stars from UConn's 1995 women's national championship basketball team have been co-coaching since Rizzotti moved back to Connecticut to take over as the Sun's president in 2021 and was looking for an AAU team for her son, Conor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a blast because we were super close in college and after college, and then when she went down to D.C. we lost a little contact,\" Lobo said. \"Now we get to see each other through the spring and through the fall.\u201d",
      "It's hard to miss a lot of the unselfish play and style the Huskies greats learned in their time under Geno Auriemma and Chris Dailey, who just finished off their 40th year at the school. Lobo and Rizzotti have instilled that in their boys' team.",
      "Lobo laughed at the notion that they were the younger version of the Hall of Fame coaches, although she acknowledged that Rizzotti, who takes the lead as coach in most of the games, has the same fiery passion as Auriemma.",
      "After one play in the boys' game when an official made a call she didn't agree with, the former point guard said something to him. As she walked away, the referee warned her, saying that he heard what she had muttered under her breath and to knock it off, which drew a chuckle from Rizzotti.",
      "Handing the clipboard over to Rizzotti when she moved back to Connecticut was a no-brainer for Lobo. Rizzotti had been a head coach at both Hartford and George Washington for two decades before coming to the Sun.",
      "\u201cOne thing I\u2019m not is stupid. And like, I think I know basketball pretty well,\" Lobo said. \"I didn\u2019t coach in college for 20-plus years like she did. It\u2019s incredible what she does with these kids. Because it\u2019s in practices, not only game strategy, where she\u2019s elite.\u201d",
      "Besides coaching on the bench, Lobo mused that her role off the court is to be the one to tell the kids to put their phones away when they are out to dinner \u2014 a Dailey trait.",
      "Coaching her son's team has allowed Rizzotti to spend more time with him.",
      "\u201cIf we were at home, he\u2019d want to be going to hang out with his friends or he\u2019s in his room sleeping,\u201d Rizzotti said. \u201cWe get a lot of time in the car together. We hang out after the games and have meals together. It\u2019s time that I\u2019ll always cherish and I\u2019ll never have again with him.\u201d",
      "Rizzotti said her son will get mad at her and talk back, but she has seen how much working together has meant to his game and their relationship.",
      "\u201cShe knows what she\u2019s talking about and it feels great that I can go out there and listen to my coach and know that she\u2019s right, like, every time,\u201d Conor said. \u201cSo it\u2019s awesome playing with these guys and being able to play under her, because we just work so well together.\u201d",
      "Their team won the tournament game on that Sunday relatively easily. Lobo graciously took photos between games with players from the girls' AAU teams and talked with players and parents on the boys' side. That's the norm at these tournaments.",
      "Lobo recalled being in Atlantic City for a tournament and a group of boys came up to her on the boardwalk asking for a photo. One of them was wearing a Clark jersey. Before she took the photos, she asked them to name a few other WNBA players and they obliged, rattling off stars of the women's league.",
      "\u201cI was like, this is amazing,\u201d she said.",
      "The championship game \u2014 one of many titles the team has won \u2014 gave Rizzotti a chance to coach against another female head coach, a rarity in boys' AAU basketball. Rizzotti had seen a couple of female coaches on the sidelines at this tournament, but hadn\u2019t come across a female head coach until the finale.",
      "Unfortunately, she's seen the ego of some male coaches get in the way at tournaments.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot of men that want to lose to a woman standing on the other sideline and things get said or done that maybe they wouldn\u2019t do in other games,\u201d Rizzotti said. \u201cIf they\u2019re up like five or six points they\u2019d start stalling with like seven or eight minutes to go because there\u2019s no shot clock and they don\u2019t want to lose to us.\u201d",
      "Rizzotti said she handled that by walking to halfcourt and saying something about trying to make the players better.",
      "\u201cLike, stalling with seven minutes left?\u201d Rizzotti said. \u201cThe parents hear me and I\u2019m like, \u2018This is what you\u2019re paying for?\u2019\"",
      "Both Lobo and Rizzotti said they will be sad when this is over in a few weeks. There's one more tournament in the area, then a trip to Myrtle Beach to close out the season. Neither plans to coach another boys' AAU team when this is done.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m gonna miss it, like, just really, really miss it,\" Lobo said. \u201cThis is the end of it. I don\u2019t really have interest in coaching another team that doesn\u2019t have my son on it.\"",

      "Brent Rooker drew a leadoff walk against Bryan Abreu (1-3) to open the ninth and reach safely in 12 straight home games. Kurtz followed with his seventh home run of the season 447 feet over the right-field wall.",
      "Kurtz also hit a ninth-inning homer on Sunday to rally the Athletics to a 3-2 win and a three-game sweep at Kansas City.",
      "The Athletics have won four straight games and are now 7-4 over the last 11 after losing 20 of the previous 21.",
      "The Astros had a five-game winning streak snapped after entering winners in 16 of their last 22.",
      "Athletics reliever J.T. Ginn struck out the side in the eighth and Mason Miller (1-2) added two strikeouts in the ninth. Starter Mitch Spence allowed seven hits and one earned run in five innings.",

So it was nice to get that first one out of the way today and look to keep this thing rolling.\u201d",

      "Louisiana soon could raise taxes on sports betting to help finance the athletic departments at many of its public universities",
      "Louisiana is poised to hike taxes on sports betting to pump more than $24 million into athletic departments at the state's most prominent public universities.",
      "Legislation pending before Gov. Jeff Landry would make Louisiana the first state to raise taxes to fund college sports since a judge approved a landmark settlement with the NCAA allowing schools to directly pay athletes for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). Anticipating the court's approval, Arkansas this year became the first to waive state income taxes on NIL payments made to athletes by higher education institutions.",
      "More states seem almost certain to adopt their own creative ways to gain an edge \u2014 or at least keep pace \u2014 in the rapidly evolving and highly competitive field of college sports.",
      "\u201cThese bills, and the inevitable ones that will follow, are intended to make states \u2019college-athlete friendly,'\u201d said David Carter, founder of the Sports Business Group consultancy and an adjunct professor at the University of Southern California. But \u201cthey will no doubt continue to stoke the debate about the `perceived' preferential treatment afforded athletes.\u201d",
      "The new NCCA rules allowing direct payments to college athletes kick in July 1. In the first year, each Division I school can share up to $20.5 million with its athletes \u2014 a figure that may be easier to meet for big-time programs than for smaller schools weighing whether to divert money from other purposes. The settlement also continues to allow college athletes to receive NIL money from third parties, such as donor-backed collectives that support specific schools.",
      "The Louisiana legislation won final approval just two days after a judge approved the antitrust settlement between the NCAA and athletes, but it had been in the works for months. Athletic directors from many of Louisiana's universities met earlier this year and hashed out a plan with lawmakers to relieve some of their financial pressures by dividing a share of the state's sports betting tax revenue.",
      "The biggest question for lawmakers was how large of a tax increase to support. The initial proposal sought to double the state's 15% tax on net proceeds from online sports betting. But lawmakers ultimately agreed on a 21.5% tax rate in a compromise with the industry.",
      "One-quarter of the tax revenue from online sports wagering \u2014 an estimated $24.3 million \u2014 would be split equally among 11 public universities in conferences with Division I football programs. The money must be used \u201cfor the benefit of student athletes,\u201d including scholarships, insurance, medical coverage, facility enhancements and litigation settlement fees.",
      "The state tax money won't provide direct NIL payments to athletes. But it could facilitate that indirectly by freeing up other university resources.",
      "The legislation passed overwhelmingly in the final days of Louisiana's annual session.",
      "\u201cWe love football in Louisiana \u2013 that\u2019s the easiest way to say it,\u201d said Republican state Rep. Neil Riser, who sponsored the bill.",
      "Many colleges and universities across the country have been feeling a financial squeeze, but it's especially affected the athletic departments of smaller schools.",
      "Athletic departments in the top Division I football conferences take in millions of dollars from media rights, donors, corporate sponsors and ticket sales, with a median of just 7% coming from student fees and institutional and government support, according to the Knight-Newhouse College Athletics Database.",
      "But the remaining schools in Division I football bowl conferences got a median of 63% of the revenue from such sources last year. And schools without football teams got a median of 81% of their athletic department revenues from institutional and governmental support or student fees.",
      "Riser said Louisiana's smaller universities, in particular, have been struggling financially and have shifted money from their general funds to their sports programs to try to remain competitive. At the same time, the state has taken in millions of dollars of tax revenue from sports bets made at least partly on college athletics.",
      "\u201cWithout the athletes, we wouldn\u2019t have the revenue. I just felt like it\u2019s fairness that we do give something back and, at the same time, help the general funds of the universities,\u201d Riser said.",
      "Louisiana would become the second state behind North Carolina to dedicate a portion of its sports wagering revenues to colleges athletics. North Carolina launched online sports wagering last year under a state law earmarking part of an 18% tax on gross gaming revenue to the athletic departments at 13 public universities. The state's two largest institutions were excluded. But that might be about to change.",
      "Differing budget plans passed by the state House and Senate this year both would start allotting sports betting tax revenue to the athletic programs at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University. The Senate version also would double the tax rate. The proposals come a year after University of North Carolina trustees approved an audit of the athletics department after a preliminary budget projected about $100 million of debt in the years ahead.",
      "Other schools also are taking actions because of deficits in their athletic departments. Last week, University of Kentucky trustees approved a $31 million operating loan for the athletics department as it begins making direct NIL payments to athletes. That came after trustees in April voted to convert the Kentucky athletics department into a limited-liability holding company \u2014 Champions Blue LLC \u2014 to more nimbly navigate the emerging financial pressures.",
      "Given the money involved in college athletics, it's not surprising that states are starting to provide tax money to athletic departments or \u2014 as in Arkansas' case \u2014 tax relief to college athletes, said Patrick Rishe, executive director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "\u201cIf you can attract better athletes to your schools and your states, then this is more visibility to your states, this is more potential out-of-town economic activity for your state,\" Rishe said. \u201cI do think you\u2019re going to see many states pursue this, because you don\u2019t want to be the state that\u2019s left exposed or at a disadvantage.\u201d",

      "\u201cIn terms of what was missing, it just was that alignment in terms of what we felt we needed from him that would be in the absolute best interest of the ballclub,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThat\u2019s a non-starter for us. We have to have that. We couldn\u2019t get there. \u2026 So we made the decision that we made.\u201d",
      "Less than two years after signing Devers to a 10-year, $313.5 million contract, the Red Sox sent him to the San Francisco Giants on Sunday night for pitchers Jordan Hicks and Kyle Harrison and a pair of prospects. The deal came on the day Boston earned a fifth straight win and completed a three-game sweep of the rival New York Yankees \u2014 a rare cause for excitement this season.",
      "\u201cIt was a shock for sure after the run that we just had this past week,\" pitcher Garrett Crochet said in Seattle before Monday night's game against the Mariners. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of season ahead of us. So, it\u2019s really just keeping your eyes forward and knowing that there\u2019s still work to be done.\u201d",

      "Chief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow acknowledged on the conference call Sunday night that the deal leaves a hole in the lineup, but he hoped it would pay off this season. Although there is a newly created need for a power hitter, the team now has roster and payroll flexibility to add players at the trade deadline, he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important to point out that this is in no way signifying a waving of the white flag on 2025,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are as committed as we were six months ago to putting a winning team on the field, to competing for the division and making a deep postseason run.\u201d",
      "Devers, a homegrown three-time All-Star, joined Ted Williams as the only Red Sox players with multiple 30-homer seasons before turning 25. But the slugger's relationship with the team soured when it signed Gold Glove third baseman Alex Bregman in February. Devers, who led the league in errors by a third baseman in each of the last seven seasons, balked at moving to designated hitter and then refused to play either first or third when Bregman and first baseman Triston Casas both got injured.",
      "\u201cWe have a responsibility to do everything we can to improve the club. And we felt we were doing that by bringing Alex Bregman to the Red Sox,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we have a responsibility, ironically, to every single player in that clubhouse to do everything in our power to improve the club. So it was something that we were committed to doing. And I do not regret that for one minute.\u201d",
      "But they lost Devers in the process.",
      "\u201cWe worked at it. We had a different vision for him going forward than he had, and we couldn\u2019t get there. We couldn\u2019t find alignment,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cAnd we reached that inflection point and made the decision to make a big move.\u201d",
      "The move came as a shock to Red Sox fans still salty over the salary dump of Mookie Betts in February 2020 \u2014 after he won the 2018 AL MVP award \u2014 in a trade that yielded little in return. The team also let Xander Bogaerts leave as a free agent before deciding Devers was the player they were willing to invest in.",
      "Now, just one full season later, he\u2019s gone, too.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s some reasons that it didn\u2019t work out,\" manager Alex Cora said. \"But the last few months hasn\u2019t been easy. We made decisions in the offseason. Circumstances changed in the last month and that\u2019s the business decision we made as an organization. Now Raffy is going to be with the Giants and like I said, we have to turn the page and be ready for this team.\u201d",
      "Breslow insisted the deal was not an attempt to cut payroll \u2014 like the deals for Betts, who went on to win two World Series in Los Angeles, or Chris Sale, who won the NL Cy Young Award in his first season with the Braves. The baseball boss acknowledged he second-guessed himself over how he handled the Bregman signing, which caught Devers by surprise, and the attempts to get the 28-year-old All-Star to change positions.",
      "\u201cI think about that question all of the time,\u201d Breslow said. \"This is not the outcome that we had expected. And it\u2019s forced me to reflect on the interactions that I\u2019ve had, not just with Raffy, but with other players and opportunities to communicate differently.\u201d",
      "The Red Sox winning streak has come with Bregman and outfielder Wilyer Abreu sidelined, joining Casas and outfielder Masataka Yoshida on the injured list. In their place, the team has relied on callups like Kristian Campbell, Marcelo Mayer and top prospect Roman Anthony, who made his major league debut to much hype last week.",
      "Breslow said the front office will continue to look for ways to improve the team, with a middle-of-the-lineup hitter a new need.",
      "\u201cFor some reason, this team (is) an example where the whole was not greater than the sum of the parts,\u201d he said. \"And being great teammates and sacrificing and stepping up for each other and embodying this shared vision, we believe that those are principles that we need to be faithful to.",
      "\u201cAnd so, at the end of the season, I think we could look back and say we\u2019ve won more games than we otherwise would have,\" he said, \"because of the way that this roster is now able to come together.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The former Japanese interpreter for baseball star Shohei Ohtani surrendered to a federal prison in Pennsylvania on Monday, beginning a nearly five-year prison sentence for bank and tax fraud after he stole nearly $17 million from the Los Angeles Dodgers player.",
      "Ippei Mizuhara, 40, was processed at a low security federal prison in Allenwood, Pennsylvania, his attorney Michael Freedman confirmed. The facility is about 125 miles (200 kilometers) northwest of Philadelphia.",
      "Mizuhara was sentenced in federal court in Santa Ana in February to four years and nine months for bank and tax fraud. He was also ordered to pay $18 million in restitution, with nearly $17 million going to Ohtani and the remainder to the IRS. He was sentenced to three years\u2019 supervised release on top of the prison sentence.",
      "Authorities said Mizuhara began accessing Ohtani\u2019s account beginning in 2021 and changed its security protocols so he could impersonate Ohtani to authorize wire transfers. He has admitted to using the money to cover his growing gambling bets and debts with an illegal bookmaker, in addition to purchasing $325,000 worth of baseball cards and paying his own dental bills.",
      "He was a close friend and confidant to Ohtani, standing by his side for many of his career highlights, from serving as his catcher during the Home Run Derby at the 2021 All-Star Game, to being there for his two American League MVP wins and his record-shattering $700 million, 10-year deal with the Los Angeles Dodgers.",
      "Ohtani is set to make his highly anticipated pitching debut Monday night for the Dodgers nearly two years after having elbow surgery.",

      "He missed time because of a strained right biceps and strained posterior cruciate ligament in his right knee (2019), strained left hamstring (2020), strained left quadriceps (2021), right ankle inflammation and left Achilles tendinitis (2022) and strained left hamstring (2023 and 2024).",

Boone said ahead of the first workout at spring training that Cousins had a strained right forearm and then the pitcher felt a pec issue after a pair of batting practice sessions last month. Cousins made minor league rehab appearances on June 3 and June 7 for High-A Hudson Valley and felt discomfort. He had a 2.37 ERA in 37 relief appearances last year, striking out 53 and walking 20 in 38 innings.",

The 31-year-old right-hander made six minor league appearances from May 18 through Saturday, then got a call on Sunday from his rehab coordinator telling him to report to Yankee Stadium. He'll likely be used at first in long relief.",

      "NASCAR\u2019s first international Cup Series race of the modern era was a cultural experience that brought new fans to the series and provided its competitors with a chance to enjoy a new country",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Despite the handful of industry insiders too scared to leave their hotels in Mexico City, NASCAR\u2019s first international Cup Series race of the modern era was a cultural experience that brought new fans to the series and provided its competitors with a chance to enjoy a new country.",
      "The event had its detractors \u2014 rumors persisted for months that it would be canceled over security concerns or the escalating tensions between the United States and Mexico \u2014 and some NASCAR team members remained critical all the way through Sunday's race.",
      "But was it a success? Even with travel delays, hotel room snafus and confusion over shuttle transportation, it was unequivocally a shining moment for NASCAR.",
      "\u201cEvery single thing about this weekend exceeded my expectations,\u201d said Daniel Suarez, the Monterrey-born NASCAR driver who was the face of the three-day weekend. \u201cThe people, the fans, the sponsors, the excitement, the energy. I had expectations for this weekend... and I can tell you that I personally exceeded those expectations.\u201d",
      "The idea to try the road course at Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez \u2014 host of one of the most popular Formula 1 events on that calendar \u2014 was the brainchild of Ben Kennedy, executive vice president and chief venue and racing innovations officer. The great-grandson of NASCAR founder Bill France Sr. has been aggressive in shaking up a schedule that went to the same tracks on the same weekends for decades.",
      "Bringing the Cup Series to Mexico City \u2014 only the third race outside the U.S. in 77 years \u2014 was a chance to expose stock car racing to a new demographic and give Mexican fans their first chance to see the series race live.",
      "\u201cThis was a historic moment for our sport, for Mexico, and for the global motorsports community,\u201d Kennedy said after Shane Van Gisbergen won Sunday's race to lock the New Zealander into the playoffs.",
      "\u201cOne of the coolest parts about this weekend was seeing the reaction of the fans. I had the opportunity to go into the stands a few times,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe energy and the passion of the fans here is unmatched.\u201d",
      "Kennedy said 90% of those in attendance were from Mexico, with 44% from Mexico City. Most important, there were \u201ca lot of new fans coming out of this weekend.\u201d",
      "Even so, Kennedy could not guarantee another race in Mexico City. FIFA has World Cup games scheduled for this same week next year and there are the logistical issues of finding a date during a packed 38-week schedule.",
      "The cars had to leave Michigan International Speedway immediately after last week's race to make the 40-hour journey across the border, and now must get to Pocono Raceway in Pennsylvania in time for this weekend's race.",
      "\u201cI want to go everywhere in the world \u2014 England, Germany, South America, Australia, every where we can go,\u201d said Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon, the vice chairman at Hendrick Motorsports. \"The next thing that makes sense in Canada. But we have to figure out the schedule before we do too much of this.",
      "\u201cWe can't do this. Michigan, Mexico City, back to Pocono, can't happen. We're doing it and we're excited to take on the challenge, but it's going to wear on us and I don't think we can do it all back-to-back. So we've got to make some adjustments to the schedule and how do we fit it all in into what's already a very difficult schedule.\u201d",
      "Nothing is off the table for Kennedy, who is globally exploring where NASCAR can race and showcase its product.",
      "One glaring issue: Those in the industry who remain comfortable with the same old schedule of traveling to Bristol, Tennessee, and Martinsville, Virginia, and Darlington Raceway in South Carolina twice a year.",
      "While those markets are tied deeply to NASCAR's Southern roots, there isn't room for growth in playing to the same crowds over and over. The pushback on Mexico City didn't come from any high-profile drivers, but Ricky Stenhouse Jr.'s spotter had a scathing social media post ripping the city in which he said \u201cscrew this place, people can talk it up all they want\u201d and 22-year-old driver Carson Hocevar had a similar sentiment in derisive comments on a live stream he has since walked back.",
      "\u201cMaybe a kid that had never been out of the country until Thursday should never give an opinion about what any place is like other than (hometown) Portage, Michigan,\u201d Hocevar posted on social media. \"I was skeptical about the trip and believed everything I read or heard about Mexico City from people who more than likely also had never been here.",
      "\u201cNow that I've actually left my hotel a couple times and raced here in front of some of the most passionate fans I've ever seen, my opinion has changed,\u201d he continued. \u201cI am embarrassed by my comments.\u201d",
      "This was baffling to some of the more well-traveled drivers, including Kyle Larson, who has raced at 200-plus different tracks around the world and makes annual trips to Australia and New Zealand. He also attended the 2021 Formula 1 season finale in Abu Dhabi and then vacationed in Dubai.",
      "He likened Mexico City to a field trip for NASCAR because the drivers all stayed in the same hotels and rode buses together to the circuit each day. On a normal weekend, they are holed up in their motorhomes at the track and rarely venture out.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s honestly really fun and enjoyable to be around your competitors and get to know each other a bit better because on a typical weekend, we just kind of lock ourselves in wherever we\u2019re at,\u201d he said. \"We don\u2019t talk to anybody or anything. So it\u2019s nice that, yeah, you\u2019re almost forced to hang out with each other. It\u2019s cool. You get to know them, so I\u2019ve enjoyed that.\u201d",
      "Even Kyle Busch, who was arrested in Mexico in 2023 for carrying a concealed weapon, was surprised by the few who had a negative response to racing in Mexico City.",
      "\u201cThe food is amazing, the city has some of the top restaurants in the world,\u201d Busch said. \u201cThis is a great place to be and I don't understand the people holed up in their hotels too scared to leave. Live a little.\u201d",

      "Since Ohtani is already on the roster as the designated hitter, the Dodgers are essentially adding an extra pitcher without having to make a corresponding roster move.",

      "Built by Alameda, California-based company Saildrone, the vessels will patrol Danish and NATO waters in the Baltic and North Seas, where maritime tensions and suspected sabotage have escalated sharply since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022.",
      "Two of the Voyagers launched Monday from Koge Marina, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) south of the Danish capital, Copenhagen. Powered by wind and solar energy, these sea drones can operate autonomously for months at sea. Saildrone says the vessels carry advanced sensor suites \u2014 radar, infrared and optical cameras, sonar and acoustic monitoring.",

      "Saildrone founder and CEO Richard Jenkins compared the vessels to a \u201ctruck\u201d that carries sensors and uses machine learning and artificial intelligence to give a \u201cfull picture of what's above and below the surface\" to about 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) in the open ocean.",
      "He said that maritime threats like damage to undersea cables, illegal fishing and the smuggling of people, weapons and drugs are going undetected simply because \u201cno one\u2019s observing it.\u201d",
      "Saildrone, he said, is \"going to places ... where we previously didn\u2019t have eyes and ears.\u201d",

And then they\u2019ll move from area to area within the Danish waters.\"",
      "The trial comes as NATO confronts a wave of damage to maritime infrastructure \u2014 including the 2022 Nord Stream pipeline explosions and the rupture of at least 11 undersea cables since late 2023. The most recent incident, in January, severed a fiber-optic link between Latvia and Sweden\u2019s Gotland island.",
      "The trial also unfolds against a backdrop of trans-Atlantic friction \u2014 with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration threatening to seize Greenland, a semiautonomous territory belonging to Denmark, a NATO member. Trump has said he wouldn't rule out military force to take Greenland.",
      "Jenkins, the founder of Saildrone, noted that his company had already planned to open its operation in Denmark before Trump was reelected. He didn't want to comment on the Greenland matter, insisting the company isn't political.",
      "Some of the maritime disruptions have been blamed on Russia\u2019s so-called shadow fleet \u2014 aging oil tankers operating under opaque ownership to avoid sanctions. One such vessel, the Eagle S, was seized by Finnish police in December for allegedly damaging a power cable between Finland and Estonia with its anchor.",
      "Western officials accuse Russia of behind behind a string of hybrid war attacks on land and at sea.",
      "Amid these concerns, NATO is moving to build a layered maritime surveillance system combining uncrewed surface vehicles like the Voyagers with traditional naval ships, satellites and seabed sensors.",
      "\u201cThe challenge is that you basically need to be on the water all the time, and it\u2019s humongously expensive,\" said Peter Viggo Jakobsen of the Royal Danish Defense College. \u201cIt\u2019s simply too expensive for us to have a warship trailing every single Russian ship, be it a warship or a civilian freighter of some kind.\u201d",

The longest eclipse lasted five hours, said the Royal Observatory of Belgium's Andrei Zhukov, the lead scientist for the orbiting corona-observing telescope. He and his team are aiming for a wondrous six hours of totality per eclipse once scientific observations begin.",
      "Scientists already are thrilled by the preliminary results that show the corona without the need for any special image processing, said Zhukov.",
      "\"We almost couldn\u2019t believe our eyes,\u201d Zhukov said in an email. \u201cThis was the first try, and it worked. It was so incredible.\u201d",
      "Zhukov anticipates an average of two solar eclipses per week being produced for a total of nearly 200 during the two-year mission, yielding more than 1,000 hours of totality. That will be a scientific bonanza since full solar eclipses produce just a few minutes of totality when the moon lines up perfectly between Earth and the sun \u2014 on average just once every 18 months.",
      "The sun continues to mystify scientists, especially its corona, which is hotter than the solar surface. Coronal mass ejections result in billions of tons of plasma and magnetic fields being hurled out into space. Geomagnetic storms can result, disrupting power and communication while lighting up the night sky with auroras in unexpected locales.",
      "While previous satellites have generated imitation solar eclipses \u2014 including the European Space Agency and NASA's Solar Orbiter and Soho observatory \u2014 the sun-blocking disk was always on the same spacecraft as the corona-observing telescope. What makes this mission unique, Zhukov said, is that the sun-shrouding disk and telescope are on two different satellites and therefore far apart.",
      "The distance between these two satellites will give scientists a better look at the part of the corona closest to the limb of the sun.",
      "\"We are extremely satisfied by the quality of these images, and again this is really thanks to formation flying\u201d with unprecedented accuracy, ESA\u2019s mission manager Damien Galano said from the Paris Air Show.",

      "A new poll finds Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his public falling-out with President Donald Trump",
      "WASHINGTON -- Tech billionaire Elon Musk has lost some of his luster with Republicans since his messy public falling-out with President Donald Trump last week, a new survey finds.",
      "Fewer Republicans view Trump's onetime government efficiency bulldog \u201cvery favorably\u201d compared with April, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Though most Republicans continue to hold a positive view of Musk, their diminished fervor suggests his vocal opposition to Trump's signature spending and tax cut legislation \u2014 and Musk's subsequent online political and personal taunts \u2014 may have cost him some enthusiasm within the party.",
      "\u201cSome things have happened lately that have changed how I feel about him a little,\u201d said Alabama Republican Katye Long, whose feelings for Musk have cooled to \u201csomewhat favorable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked what he was doing when he was helping. But now I feel like he\u2019s kind of hurting,\u201d said the 34-year-old automotive component factory employee and mother of three from Woodstock, Alabama. \u201cI also don\u2019t feel like he matters that much. He\u2019s not actually part of the government. He\u2019s just a rich guy who pushes his opinions.\u201d",
      "Musk's overall popularity hasn't shifted, the poll found, and most of the shift among Democrats and Republicans was between \u201cvery\u201d and \u201csomewhat\u201d strong opinions. Americans are less likely to view him favorably than his electric vehicle company, Tesla. That said, about half of Americans have a negative opinion of Tesla, highlighting another challenge for Musk when the company has dropped in value and been the target of protests in the U.S. and Europe. About one-third have a favorable view of Tesla, while about 2 in 10 don't know enough to say.",
      "Even a subtle shift in the intensity of Republicans\u2019 feelings about Musk could be important as the electric car and aerospace mogul weighs a second political act after spending about $200 million in service of Trump\u2019s 2024 election effort.",
      "After decrying the GOP\u2019s massive tax and budget policy bill as \u201ca disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk wrote on X, his social media platform, \u201cIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people.\u201d",
      "The poll suggests the messy feud with Trump may have rubbed some Republicans the wrong way, as the share of Republicans viewing Musk as \u201cvery favorable\u201d has dropped from 38% in April to 26% now. At the same time, antipathy toward Musk among Democrats has waned a little. About two-thirds, 65%, of Democrats have a very negative view of Musk, down slightly from about three-quarters, 74%, in April.",
      "Musk's bitter back-and-forth with Trump has business implications, too. Tesla was already struggling with a backlash against Musk's association with Trump. Sales across Europe plunged by half in May, even as growth in the electric car market accelerated. Then the company's shares plunged in value when Musk began sparring publicly with the president.",
      "Victoria Brown, of Kansas City, Kansas, rated Tesla \u201csomewhat unfavorable\u201d because she objects to how Trump is conducting his administration and links the company\u2019s owner with the president\u2019s agenda.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t favor Trump. So, pretty much the fact that they have been working together means I don\u2019t care too much for Tesla,\u201d said Brown, 63, a political independent and an insurance agent.",
      "While the intensity of people's feelings about Musk may have changed, their overall opinions have not. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Musk, compared with about 6 in 10 who hold an unfavorable view, while about 1 in 10 don't know enough to say. That's unchanged from the April poll.",
      "The new poll was conducted June 5-9, after Musk left his government role and began attacking Trump's marquee legislative priority.",
      "Musk's public clash with Trump began four days after Trump honored Musk effusively during an Oval Office event discharging him from duties as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "After first tearing down the budget bill, Musk two days later complained he had never seen the language, and he aimed his fire at Trump, suggesting the president didn't sufficiently appreciate the role Musk assumed as the chief benefactor to Trump's reelection effort.",
      "\u201cWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d Musk wrote. \u201cSuch ingratitude.\u201d",
      "Musk went on to claim without evidence that the federal government was concealing information about Trump's association with infamous pedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Musk deleted the post, and early Wednesday he stepped back from his attacks on Trump, writing on X that he regretted some of his posts and they \u201cwent too far.\u201d",
      "Tesla endured a difficult first quarter in 2025, with its sales falling while the world\u2019s leading electric car manufacturer faced protests in showrooms. The new poll also shows that Tesla is viewed far more negatively than some of its peers \u2014 notably, Ford, Toyota and General Motors.",
      "Only about one-third of U.S. adults have a \u201cvery\u201d or \u201csomewhat\u201d favorable view of Tesla. About half of U.S. adults have an unfavorable opinion of Tesla, including 30% of Republicans. Democrats, at 66%, are more than twice as likely as Republicans to have a negative view of Tesla. But even among Republicans, Tesla is viewed less favorably than the other brands.",
      "Marisa Mills is no Musk fan. The 41-year-old teacher from Oakland, California, objects to his association with Trump and what the Democrat sees as their misguided notion that government is always well served by operating like a business.",
      "And yet she was once proud to have Tesla building cars in her own county. She soured on the company in 2020, when Musk sued Alameda County over its workplace restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, before he moved the company to Texas in 2021.",
      "\u201cMy government is supposed to serve the people, not his company. We were all glad to see him go,\u201d Mills said. \u201cI do regret that we now have feelings of regret for the Tesla car product. We were once so proud.\u201d",

      "Meta is making a $14.3 billion investment in artificial intelligence company Scale and recruiting its CEO Alexandr Wang to join a team developing \u201csuperintelligence\u201d at the tech giant.",
      "The deal announced Thursday reflects a push by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg to revive AI efforts at the parent company of Facebook and Instagram as it faces tough competition from rivals such as Google and OpenAI.",
      "Meta announced what it called a \u201cstrategic partnership and investment\u201d with Scale late Thursday. Scale said the $14.3 billion investment puts its market value at over $29 billion.",
      "Scale said it will remain an independent company but the agreement will \u201csubstantially expand Scale and Meta\u2019s commercial relationship.\u201d Meta will hold a 49% stake in the startup.",
      "Wang, though leaving for Meta with a small group of other Scale employees, will remain on Scale\u2019s board of directors. Replacing him is a new interim Scale CEO Jason Droege, who was previously the company\u2019s chief strategy officer and had past executive roles at Uber Eats and Axon.",
      "Zuckerberg's increasing focus on the abstract idea of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d \u2014 which rival companies call artificial general intelligence, or AGI \u2014 is the latest pivot for a tech leader who in 2021 went all-in on the idea of the metaverse, changing the company's name and investing billions into advancing virtual reality and related technology.",
      "It won't be the first time since ChatGPT's 2022 debut sparked an AI arms race that a big tech company has gobbled up talent and products at innovative AI startups without formally acquiring them. Microsoft hired key staff from startup Inflection AI, including co-founder and CEO Mustafa Suleyman, who now runs Microsoft's AI division.",
      "Google pulled in the leaders of AI chatbot company Character.AI, while Amazon made a deal with San Francisco-based Adept that sent its CEO and key employees to the e-commerce giant. Amazon also got a license to Adept\u2019s AI systems and datasets.",
      "Wang was a 19-year-old student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he and co-founder Lucy Guo started Scale in 2016.",
      "They won influential backing that summer from the startup incubator Y Combinator, which was led at the time by Sam Altman, now the CEO of OpenAI. Wang dropped out of MIT, following a trajectory similar to that of Zuckerberg, who quit Harvard University to start Facebook more than a decade earlier.",
      "Scale's pitch was to supply the human labor needed to improve AI systems, hiring workers to draw boxes around a pedestrian or a dog in a street photo so that self-driving cars could better predict what's in front of them. General Motors and Toyota have been among Scale's customers.",
      "What Scale offered to AI developers was a more tailored version of Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which had long been a go-to service for matching freelance workers with temporary online jobs.",
      "More recently, the growing commercialization of AI large language models \u2014 the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Meta's Llama \u2014 brought a new market for Scale's annotation teams. The company claims to service \u201cevery leading large language model,\u201d including from Anthropic, OpenAI, Meta and Microsoft, by helping to fine tune their training data and test their performance. It's not clear what the Meta deal will mean for Scale's other customers.",
      "Wang has also sought to build close relationships with the U.S. government, winning military contracts to supply AI tools to the Pentagon and attending President Donald Trump's inauguration. The head of Trump's science and technology office, Michael Kratsios, was an executive at Scale for the four years between Trump's first and second terms. Meta has also begun providing AI services to the federal government.",
      "Meta has taken a different approach to AI than many of its rivals, releasing its flagship Llama system for free as an open-source product that enables people to use and modify some of its key components. Meta says more than a billion people use its AI products each month, but it's also widely seen as lagging behind competitors such as OpenAI and Google in encouraging consumer use of large language models, also known as LLMs.",

      "These are all characteristics of intelligent behavior that large language models \u201cbasically cannot do, or they can only do them in a very superficial, approximate way,\u201d LeCun said.",
      "Instead, he emphasized Meta's interest in \u201ctracing a path towards human-level AI systems, or perhaps even superhuman.\u201d When he returned to France's annual VivaTech conference again on Wednesday, LeCun dodged a question about the pending Scale deal but said his AI research team's plan has \u201calways been to reach human intelligence and go beyond it.\u201d",

      "New research says long-billed curlews listen to alarm barks from prairie dog colonies to protect themselves from predators",
      "WASHINGTON -- Prairie dogs are the Paul Reveres of the Great Plains: They bark to alert neighbors to the presence of predators, with separate calls for dangers coming by land or by air.",
      "\u201cPrairie dogs are on the menu for just about every predator you can think of\u201d\u2014 golden eagles, red-tailed hawks, foxes, badgers, even large snakes \u2014 said Andy Boyce, a research ecologist in Montana at the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.",
      "Those predators will also snack on grassland nesting birds like the long-billed curlew.",
      "To protect themselves, the curlews eavesdrop on the alarms coming from prairie dog colonies, according to research published Thursday in the journal Animal Behavior.",
      "Previous research has shown birds frequently eavesdrop on other bird species to glean information about potential food sources or approaching danger, said Georgetown University ornithologist Emily Williams, who was not involved in the study. But, so far, scientists have documented only a few instances of birds eavesdropping on mammals.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s rare in the wild,\u201d she said, \u201cit just means we haven\u2019t studied it yet.\u201d",
      "Prairie dogs live in large colonies with a series of burrows that may stretch for miles underground. When they hear one each other\u2019s barks, they either stand alert watching or dive into their burrows to avoid approaching talons and claws.",
      "\u201cThose little barks are very loud \u2014 they can carry quite a long way,\u201d said co-author Andrew Dreelin, who also works for the Smithsonian.",
      "The long-billed curlew nests in short-grass prairie and incubates eggs on a ground nest. When one hears the prairie dog alarm, she responds by pressing her head, beak and belly close to the ground.",
      "In this crouched position, the birds \u201crely on the incredible camouflage of their feathers to become essentially invisible on the Plains,\u201d Dreelin said.",
      "To test just how alert the birds were to prairie dog chatter, researchers created a fake predator by strapping a taxidermied badger onto a small remote-controlled vehicle. They sent this badger rolling over the prairie of north-central Montana toward curlew nests \u2014 sometimes in silence and sometimes while playing recorded prairie dog barks.",
      "When the barks were played, curlews ducked into the grass quickly, hiding when the badger was around 160 feet (49 meters) away. Without the barks, the remote-controlled badger got within about 52 feet (16 meters) of the nests before the curlews appeared to sense danger.",
      "\u201cYou have a much higher chance of avoiding predation if you go into that cryptic posture sooner \u2014 and the birds do when they hear prairie dogs barking,\u201d said co-author Holly Jones, a conservation biologist at Northern Illinois University.",
      "Prairie dogs are often thought of as \u201cenvironmental engineers,\u201d she said, because they construct extensive burrows and nibble down prairie grass, keeping short-grass ecosystems intact.",

      "Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity",
      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everything ever said on the internet was just the start of teaching artificial intelligence about humanity. Tech companies are now tapping into an older repository of knowledge: the library stacks.",
      "Nearly one million books published as early as the 15th century \u2014 and in 254 languages \u2014 are part of a Harvard University collection being released to AI researchers Thursday. Also coming soon are troves of old newspapers and government documents held by Boston's public library.",
      "Cracking open the vaults to centuries-old tomes could be a data bonanza for tech companies battling lawsuits from living novelists, visual artistsand others whose creative works have been scooped up without their consent to train AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cIt is a prudent decision to start with public domain data because that\u2019s less controversial right now than content that\u2019s still under copyright,\u201d said Burton Davis, a deputy general counsel at Microsoft.",
      "Davis said libraries also hold \u201csignificant amounts of interesting cultural, historical and language data\u201d that's missing from the past few decades of online commentary that AI chatbots have mostly learned from.",
      "Supported by \u201cunrestricted gifts\u201d from Microsoft and ChatGPT maker OpenAI, the Harvard-based Institutional Data Initiative is working with libraries around the world on how to make their historic collections AI-ready in a way that also benefits libraries and the communities they serve.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to move some of the power from this current AI moment back to these institutions,\u201d said Aristana Scourtas, who manages research at Harvard Law School\u2019s Library Innovation Lab. \u201cLibrarians have always been the stewards of data and the stewards of information.\u201d",
      "Harvard's newly released dataset, Institutional Books 1.0, contains more than 394 million scanned pages of paper. One of the earlier works is from the 1400s \u2014 a Korean painter\u2019s handwritten thoughts about cultivating flowers and trees. The largest concentration of works is from the 19th century, on subjects such as literature, philosophy, law and agriculture, all of it meticulously preserved and organized by generations of librarians.",
      "It promises to be a boon for AI developers trying to improve the accuracy and reliability of their systems.",
      "\u201cA lot of the data that\u2019s been used in AI training has not come from original sources,\u201d said the data initiative's executive director, Greg Leppert, who is also chief technologist at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. This book collection goes \"all the way back to the physical copy that was scanned by the institutions that actually collected those items,\u201d he said.",
      "Before ChatGPT sparked a commercial AI frenzy, most AI researchers didn\u2019t think much about the provenance of the passages of text they pulled from Wikipedia, from social media forums like Reddit and sometimes from deep repositories of pirated books. They just needed lots of what computer scientists call tokens \u2014 units of data, each of which can represent a piece of a word.",
      "Harvard\u2019s new AI training collection has an estimated 242 billion tokens, an amount that's hard for humans to fathom but it's still just a drop of what's being fed into the most advanced AI systems. Facebook parent company Meta, for instance, has said the latest version of its AI large language model was trained on more than 30 trillion tokens pulled from text, images and videos.",
      "Meta is also battling a lawsuit from comedian Sarah Silverman and other published authors who accuse the company of stealing their books from \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated works.",
      "Now, with some reservations, the real libraries are standing up.",
      "OpenAI, which is also fighting a string of copyright lawsuits, donated $50 million this year to a group of research institutions including Oxford University's 400-year-old Bodleian Library, which is digitizing rare texts and using AI to help transcribe them.",
      "When the company first reached out to the Boston Public Library, one of the biggest in the U.S., the library made clear that any information it digitized would be for everyone, said Jessica Chapel, its chief of digital and online services.",
      "\u201cOpenAI had this interest in massive amounts of training data. We have an interest in massive amounts of digital objects. So this is kind of just a case that things are aligning,\u201d Chapel said.",
      "Digitization is expensive. It\u2019s been painstaking work, for instance, for Boston's library to scan and curate dozens of New England\u2019s French-language newspapers that were widely read in the late 19th and early 20th century by Canadian immigrant communities from Quebec. Now that such text is of use as training data, it helps bankroll projects that librarians want to do anyway.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been very clear that, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re a public library,\u2019\" Chapel said. \u201cOur collections are held for public use, and anything we digitized as part of this project will be made public.\u201d",
      "Harvard's collection was already digitized starting in 2006 for another tech giant, Google, in its controversial project to create a searchable online library of more than 20 million books.",
      "Google spent years beating back legal challenges from authors to its online book library, which included many newer and copyrighted works. It was finally settled in 2016 when the U.S. Supreme Court let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "Now, for the first time, Google has worked with Harvard to retrieve public domain volumes from Google Books and clear the way for their release to AI developers. Copyright protections in the U.S. typically last for 95 years, and longer for sound recordings.",
      "How useful all of this will be for the next generation of AI tools remains to be seen as the data gets shared Thursday on the Hugging Face platform, which hosts datasets and open-source AI models that anyone can download.",
      "The book collection is more linguistically diverse than typical AI data sources. Fewer than half the volumes are in English, though European languages still dominate, particularly German, French, Italian, Spanish and Latin.",
      "A book collection steeped in 19th century thought could also be \u201cimmensely critical\u201d for the tech industry's efforts to build AI agents that can plan and reason as well as humans, Leppert said.",
      "\u201cAt a university, you have a lot of pedagogy around what it means to reason,\u201d Leppert said. \u201cYou have a lot of scientific information about how to run processes and how to run analyses.\u201d",
      "At the same time, there's also plenty of outdated data, from debunked scientific and medical theories to racist narratives.",
      "\u201cWhen you\u2019re dealing with such a large data set, there are some tricky issues around harmful content and language,\" said Kristi Mukk, a coordinator at Harvard's Library Innovation Lab who said the initiative is trying to provide guidance about mitigating the risks of using the data, to \u201chelp them make their own informed decisions and use AI responsibly.\u201d",
      "\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014",
      "The Associated Press and OpenAI have a licensing and technology agreement that allows OpenAI access to part of AP\u2019s text archives.",

      "MILAN -- A salvage company expects to lift the wreck of the luxury Bayesian yacht in late June from the seafloor off Sicily where it sank last summer, killing seven people, according to a recovery plan agreed with Italian maritime and investigating authorities, the TMC salvage company said Wednesday.",
      "Salvage teams in the past week have recovered 17 pieces of suspected Bayesian debris from the sea floor identified using a remote-controlled submersible. They have been transferred to shore in Termini Imerese as part of the investigation.",
      "The British-flagged superyacht sank in August, killing U.K. tech magnate Mike Lynch, his daughter and five others.",
      "Several days before the 56-meter (183-foot) long 473-ton yacht is lifted to the surface, crews will use precision tools to remove the 72-meter mast. After that, the Bayesian will be set upright and then gradually lifted to the surface with eight main steel lifting strops that will be installed under the hull. The whole process is expected to take several days.",
      "Marine salvage experts began the operation in early May to recover the superyacht, which is on the seafloor at a depth of about 49 meters (160 feet.) The operation was temporarily halted after a diver\u2019s death a few days later, and the new recovery plan was approved on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThe salvage teams will now hopefully be able to make more systematic progress in preparations for the ultimate safe recovery of Bayesian, whilst ensuring the safety of those working on this very complex lifting and recovery operation,\u2019\u2019 said Marcus Cave, a TMC Marine director.",
      "British investigators in an interim report issued last month said that the yacht was knocked over by \u201cextreme wind\u201d and couldn\u2019t recover. The report stated that the Bayesian had chosen the site where it sank as shelter from forecast thunderstorms. Wind speeds exceeded 70 knots (81 mph.) at the time of the sinking at 4:06 a.m. on Aug. 19 and \u201cviolently\u201d knocked the vessel over to a 90-degree angle in under 15 seconds.",

      "\"I was like, 'Dad, that\u2019s somebody,'\" she told the outlet. \"He said, 'Hang up and call somebody.'\"",
      "Moments later, Thomas was flagging down a member of law enforcement, she said, and telling them about the man she\u2019d seen out by the culvert. What followed was the arrest of the suspected Minnesota gunman, Vance Boelter, whom local, state and federal law enforcement had been trying to locate for about 43 hours.",
      "Boelter is accused of killing Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in \"political assassinations,\" acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Minnesota Joseph Thompson said.",

      "Boelter allegedly surveilled his victims' homes and took notes, Thompson said. In a search of a home in north Minneapolis tied to Boelter, authorities seized a list of public officials that had a notation under Melissa Hortman's name reading, \"married Mark 2 children 11th term,\" according to the affidavit. Another notebook included an added notation next to Melissa Hortman's name reading, \"Big house off golf course 2 ways in to watch from one spot,\" the affidavit said.",
      "He \"stalked his victims like prey\" and \"shot them in cold blood,\" Thompson said.",

      "A motive remains under investigation. But Minnesota state Sen. Scott Dribble, who worked with Hortman, told ABC News on Monday that he was \"very concerned about the nature of the rhetoric that's occurring with politics, especially among right-wing extremists.\"",
      "Dribble pointed to what he saw as a change in recent years for \"those at the highest levels to engage in rhetoric of dehumanisation, politicizing instruments of government, politicizing our military, and really calling for a violent response rather than really having vigorous policy debates.\"",

Peggy Flanagan said \"every elected official of every stripe and party has to turn down the temperature.\" Elected representatives and government staffers should in difficult times be displaying their \"humanity\" and reaching across the aisle, Flanagan told ABC News on Monday.",
      "\"Our community, our families, you know, taking care of each other, stepping up for one another. And that needs to continue to be the message during this time of divisive rhetoric,\" she said.",
      "The sentiment was echoed by Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.",
      "\"The way our nation moves forward is not through hate. It is not through violence,\" Walz said in a statement Monday. \"It is through humility, and grace, and compassion.\"",

      "The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals will preside over a remote hearing regarding California's challenge to President Donald Trump's federalization of the state's National Guard troops amid protests over immigration enforcement in the Los Angeles area.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in California issued a temporary restraining order that would have blocked Trump's deployment of the troops and returned control of the California National Guard to Gov. Gavin Newsom, who did not consent to the Guard's activation.",
      "However, following an appeal by the Trump administration, a panel of three judges on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an administrative stay of the lower court's order, dealing the Trump administration a temporary reprieve to what would have been a major reversal of its policy on the protests in Los Angeles.",
      "The three-judge panel -- made up of two judges nominated by Trump and one nominated by former President Joe Biden -- scheduled the hearing on the matter for Tuesday afternoon.",
      "The district judge's order called Trump's actions \"illegal.\"",
      "\"At this early stage of the proceedings, the Court must determine whether the President followed the congressionally mandated procedure for his actions. He did not,\" U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said in his June 12 order granting the temporary restraining order sought by Newsom. \"His actions were illegal -- both exceeding the scope of his statutory authority and violating the Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. He must therefore return control of the California National Guard to the Governor of the State of California forthwith.\"",
      "The order did not limit Trump's use of the Marines, which had also been deployed to LA.",
      "In a press conference after the district court's order, Newsom said he was \"gratified\" by the ruling, saying he would return the National Guard \"to what they were doing before Donald Trump commandeered them.\"",
      "In its appeal to the Ninth Circuit, administration lawyers called the district judge's order \"unprecedented\" and an \"extraordinary intrusion on the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief.\"",
      "Some 4,000 National Guardsmen and 700 Marines were ordered to the Los Angeles area following protests over immigration raids. California leaders claim Trump inflamed the protests by sending in the military when it was not necessary.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Members of Congress will attend emergency briefings this week after the murder of a Minnesota state lawmaker brought renewed fears \u2014 and stoked existing partisan tensions \u2014 over the security of federal lawmakers when in Washington and at home.",
      "The suspect in the attack had dozens of federal lawmakers listed in his writings, in addition to the state lawmakers and others he allegedly targeted. The man is accused of shooting and killing former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs and wounding another lawmaker and his wife at their home.",
      "The shootings come after credible threats to members of Congress have more than doubled in the last decade, the troubling tally of an era that has been marked by a string of violent attacks against lawmakers and their families.",
      "In 2011, Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords was shot and wounded at an event in her Arizona district. In 2017, Republican Rep. Steve Scalise was shot and wounded as he practiced for a congressional baseball game with other GOP lawmakers near Washington. In 2022, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s husband Paul was attacked in his home by a man who broke into their San Francisco home. And in 2024, two different men tried to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign.",
      "All four survived, some with serious injuries. But those attacks, among others and many close calls for members of both parties, have rattled lawmakers and raised recurring questions about whether they have enough security \u2014 and whether they can ever be truly safe in their jobs.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have a solution to this problem right now,\u201d said Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, a friend of Hortman\u2019s who received increased security after the attack. \u201cI just see so clearly that this current state of play is not sustainable.\u201d",

In 2017, there were 3,939 investigated threats, the Capitol Police said.",
      "While members of Congress may be high-profile, they do have some resources available that might not be available to state and local lawmakers, said Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, who was a member of the South Dakota state Senate for 10 years before he was the state\u2019s governor. In the state legislature, \u201cit just wasn\u2019t feasible all the time\u201d to have increased security, Rounds said.",
      "As threats have increased, members of Congress have had access to new funding to add security at their personal homes. But it is unclear how many have used it and whether there is enough money to keep lawmakers truly safe.",
      "\u201cResources should not be the reason that a U.S. senator or congressman gets killed,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Instead of bringing lawmakers together, the Minnesota shootings have created new internal tensions. Smith on Monday confronted one of her fellow senators, Utah Republican Mike Lee, for a series of posts on X over the weekend. One mocked Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who ran for vice president last year. Another post said of the murders, \u201cThis is what happens when Marxists don\u2019t get their way.\u201d",
      "Friends and former colleagues interviewed by The Associated Press described Vance Luther Boelter, the man accused of assassinating Hortman and her husband, as a devout Christian who attended an evangelical church and went to campaign rallies for Trump. Records show Boelter registered to vote as a Republican while living in Oklahoma in 2004 before moving to Minnesota, where voters don\u2019t list party affiliation.",
      "Smith talked to Lee outside a GOP conference meeting as soon as she arrived in Washington on Monday. \u201cI would say he seemed surprised to be confronted,\u201d she told reporters afterward.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also called out Lee\u2019s posts on the Senate floor, saying that for him to \u201cfan the flames of division with falsities, while the killer was still on the loose, is deeply irresponsible. He should take his posts down and immediately apologize to the families of the victims.\u201d",
      "Lee\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Lawmakers were already on edge before the shootings, which came less than two days after Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla was forcibly removed from a press conference with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in California. Officers restrained Padilla and put him on the ground.",
      "Angry Democratic senators immediately took to the Senate floor Thursday afternoon to denounce Padilla's treatment. \u201cWhat was really hard for me to see was that a member of this body was driven to his knees and made to kneel before authorities,\u201d said New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker. \u201cThis is a test. This is a crossroads.\u201d",
      "At the briefing Tuesday, Senate Democrats say they plan to ask security officials, as well as Republican leadership, about Padilla\u2019s removal from the press conference as well as their protection against outside threats.",
      "\u201cI certainly hope to hear leadership responding in a profound way,\u201d said New Mexico Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, a Democrat.",
      "Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis., who said she had been informed that her name was also on the suspect\u2019s list, said she wanted to hear recommendations at the briefing on how to improve security.",

      "One U.S. official told ABC News that the president, so far, has not felt a need to sign the statement, as he has already spoken out publicly about the ongoing conflict and made his position clear.",
      "\"Under the strong leadership of President Trump, the United States is back to leading the effort to restore peace around the world. President Trump will continue to work towards ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon,\" a White House official when asked about Trump not signing the joint statement.",
      "The delegations representing the other countries will continue to work through the language in hopes of finalizing a statement, according to a source familiar with the discussions.",
      "It is typical for the leaders to release communiqu\u00e9 that conveys a shared consensus. In 2017, Trump was the only G7 leader not to endorse the Paris Agreement. At the time, the section on climate change acknowledged the United States was \"not in a position to join the consensus on these topics.\"",
      "Earlier Monday, Trump said that Iran wants to \"talk\" about de-escalation as aerial attacks continue between Tehran and Israel.",
      "Trump took questions on the deepening conflict as he met with Canadian Prime Minster Mark Carney at the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, on Monday.",
      "\"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before,\" Trump said of Iran. \"I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. And on the 61st day I said, 'We don't have a deal.' They have to make a deal.\"",
      "\"It's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war,\" Trump continued. \"And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.\"",
      "The U.S. president would not comment on what it would take for the United States to get involved militarily.",
      "\"I don't want to talk about that,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "Trump told ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott on Sunday that the U.S. was not involved in Israel's military strikes against Iran, but that \"it's possible we could get involved.\"",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in an interview with ABC News on Monday, argued it was in America's interest to support Israel as it seeks to eliminate Iran's nuclear program.",
      "\"We're not just fighting our enemy. We're fighting your enemy. For God's sake, they chant, 'death to Israel, death to America.' We're simply on their way. And this could reach America soon,\" Netanyahu said.",
      "Before the strikes began, Trump had publicly urged Israel not to hit Iran -- stating it could derail efforts to secure a nuclear agreement with the Middle Eastern nation.",
      "But his tone shifted after Israeli forces launched their attacks. Trump called them \"excellent\" and suggested they would help bring Iran back to the negotiating table.",
      "On Sunday, he said the two sides might have to fight it out, but expressed hope a solution would ultimately be reached.",
      "\"Well, I hope there's going to be a deal,\" he said before departing the White House for Canada. \"I think it's time for a deal, and we'll see what happens. But sometimes they have to fight it out, but we're going to see what happens. I think there's a good chance there will be a deal after.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 11:12:32 -0400",
    "summary": "The recent shootings of lawmakers in Minnesota are part of a disturbing trend toward politically linked violence, ABC News analysts say.",
    "story": [
      "Violence has expanded its scope in recent years.",
      "The shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers has sent shockwaves across the nation. This grim development marks a disturbing escalation: while violence is not new, its recent migration to the state and local level represents a concerning trend.",
      "Violence against public officials has been increasing in recent years, including the two recent assassination attempts in 2024 against President Donald Trump. The 2011 assassination attempt on Rep. Gabby Giffords, initially perceived as an anomaly at the time, now appears to have been a precursor to a rising tide of threats against an expanding sphere of elected officials.",
      "This trend was further highlighted in 2017 when a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia, was targeted by an individual motivated by political grievances. Five people were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise, when the gunman unleashed a hail of 70 rounds.",
      "In many of these cases, investigations consistently revealed that the suspects harbored either real or perceived grievances against the politician or their political beliefs, and subsequently acted upon those grievances.",
      "A 2015 study by the U.S. Secret Service, examining attacks against the federal government, shed light on the perpetrators. It found that offenders choose their targets for reasons including retaliation, the furtherance of ideological beliefs, personal gain, or seeking fame and attention. Nearly half of these offenders exhibited evidence of fixation \u2013 an intense or obsessive preoccupation with an individual, activity, or idea. Over half had prior arrests or criminal charges, and more than half had a history of violence towards others.",
      "Furthermore, the study found, almost half communicated their intentions to others about the target or directly with their targets. A third of the offenders made threats or veiled references of harm through online postings, verbal comments, personal manifestos, letters, and other means. Only three offenders communicated threats verbally and in-person directly to their targets.",
      "The 2025 Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Homeland Threat Assessment underscored these concerns, stating that \"the 2024 election cycle will be an attractive target for many adversaries.\"",
      "\"Some domestic violent extremists (DVEs) likely view a wide range of targets indirectly and directly associated with elections as viable targets for violence with the intent of instilling fear among voters, candidates, and election workers, as well as disrupting election processes leading up to and after the November election,\" the assessment added.",
      "So, why is this rise in targeted violence occurring?",
      "A June 2024 Chapman University study suggests \"declining levels of confidence in some of our most important social institutions and growing political divisions across society\" as a possible cause. The study notes a steady increase in threats against public officials since 2017, coinciding with a general rise in polarization following the 2016 presidential election. It further posits that \"the growing number of threats may represent a growing tolerance for violence among Americans and the formation of 'a culture that helps normalize their use to express certain ideas and emotions.'\"",
      "The study identifies what it says are significant obstacles to effective responses, including the blurry line between protected speech and criminal threats and the anonymity facilitated by digital technology.",
      "As the study points out, the digital age, with its access to the \"dark web,\" violent online content, and the ease with which individuals can identify public officials, their residences, and their activities, has created unprecedented targeting opportunities. This helps explain the observed increase in violence across all levels of government, including state and local officials, a trend that unfortunately appears to be continuing.",
      "For those in the public sphere, prioritizing personal protection and implementing basic security measures are crucial. These include alarm systems at home, security cameras to identify visitors, and controlling who comes into contact with them. While being a public official and ensuring safety can be conflicting and elusive goals in this climate, these fundamental steps can significantly enhance their security.",
      "Donald J. Mihalek is an ABC News contributor, retired senior Secret Service agent and regional field training instructor who served during two presidential transitions. He was also a police officer and served in the U.S. Coast Guard.",
      "Richard Frankel is an ABC News contributor and retired FBI special agent who was the special agent in charge of the FBI's Newark Division and prior to that, the FBI's New York Joint Terrorism TASK force.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- A group of tourists were sitting at an outdoor table in the Spanish city of Barcelona, trying to enjoy their drinks, when a woman raised a cheap plastic water gun and shot an arc of water at them.",
      "Her weapon of choice \u2014 the cheap, squirt-squirt variety \u2014 is an increasingly common fixture at anti-tourism protests in the southern European country, where many locals fear that an overload of visitors is driving them from their cherished neighborhoods.",
      "How did the humble water gun become a symbol of discontent?",
      "The phenomenon started last July, when a fringe, left-wing activist group based in Barcelona that promotes the \u201cdegrowth\u201d of the city\u2019s successful tourism sector held its first successful rally. Some brought water guns to shoot one another and stay cool in the summer heat.",
      "\u201cWhat happened later went viral, but in reality it was just kind of a joke by a group of people who brought water guns because it was hot,\" Adriana Coten, one of the organizers of Neighborhood Assembly for Tourism Degrowth, told The Associated Press.",
      "Then, some turned their water guns from each other to tourists. The images went around the world, becoming a publicity coup for the anti-tourism cause.",
      "The guns reappeared in April when the same group stopped a tour bus in Barcelona, the Catalan capital.",
      "On Sunday, around a thousand people marched from a luxury shopping boulevard popular with affluent foreigners before police stopped them from getting closer to Barcelona's top sight-seeing destination: La Sagrada Familia church.",
      "The marchers spritzed unsuspecting tourists along the way, chanting slogans and carrying protest signs. One read: \u201cOne more tourist, one less resident!\u201d",
      "They left a trail of stickers on hotel doors, lampposts and outdoor caf\u00e9 tables showing a squirting water gun encircled by a message in English: \u201cTourist Go Home!\u201d",
      "Still, the number of Barcelona protesters carrying water guns was a minority \u2014 and in the gun-toting group, many were only shooting in the air or at each other. One dad was toting his baby in a front-pack, water gun in hand.",
      "Outside the protests, Barcelona locals are not toting water guns or taking aim at tourists. And many in the city still support tourism, which is a pillar of the local economy.",
      "Can the water gun really change the minds of tourists, authorities or the businesses that drive the industry? Depends on who you ask.",
      "Protester Lourdes S\u00e1nchez and her teenage daughter, each holding a water gun, said the gun \"really isn\u2019t to hurt anyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is a symbol to say that we are fed up of how tourism industry is transforming our country into a theme park,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said.",
      "Another demonstrator, Andreu Mart\u00ednez, acknowledged it was \u201cto bother the tourists a bit.\"",
      "Laurens Schocher, a 46-year-old architect, said he didn't shoot any suspected tourists but hoped that carrying a water gun would bring more attention to their cause.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think the tourists will get it,\" he said. \"I think this is to send a message to authorities.\u201d",
      "The marchers had no monster, pump-action water cannons most kids use for backyard battles in the summer. Theirs were the old-school, cheap-o water guns that send a slim jet of water not that far away.",
      "Some tourists who were sprayed took it in stride, even claiming it was refreshing on a day with temperatures pushing up to around 30 degrees Celsius (87 Fahrenheit).",
      "But there were moments of tension. When several marchers squirted workers at a large hostel, tempers flared and one worker spat at his attackers as he slammed the hostel door shut.",
      "Nora Tsai, who had just arrived from Taiwan on a short visit, was among those spritzed on Sunday. She said she was a bit frightened and saddened. The \u201cTourist go home!\" chants didn't help either.",

      "Escorsa, 33, is just one of many residents who believe tourism has gone too far in the city famed for Antoni Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade, running roughshod over communities and exacerbating a housing crisis.",
      "It's not just a Spanish problem. Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with overtourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Barcelona, where protesters plan to take to the streets on Sunday.",

Two months later, the city stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "A survey by Spain's public opinion office last year showed more than three-quarters of respondents favored tighter regulations on tourist apartments. Spain\u2019s left-wing government approved regulations making it easier for owners of apartments to block others from renting to tourists in their building, as well as approving measures to allow cities like Barcelona to cap rents. And last month, it ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform which it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain\u2019s Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told AP that the tourism sector \u201ccannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\u201d which enshrines their right to housing and well-being.",

      "The short-term rental industry believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\u201cI think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\u201d Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago told the AP. \u201cIf you look at the over-tourism problem in Spain, it has been brewing for decades, and probably since the 60s.\"",
      "He says hotels are still the leading accommodation for tourists. In Barcelona, hotels accounted for 20 million tourists in 2024, compared with 12 million who used homes, according to local data.",

      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Escorsa, the teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city; he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",

      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The NAACP filed an intent to sue Elon Musk\u2019s artificial intelligence company xAI on Tuesday over concerns about air pollution generated by a supercomputer located near predominantly Black communities.",
      "The xAI data center began operating gas turbines last year, emitting air pollution, without first applying for a permit under an exemption that allowed them to do so for 364 days. The permit application now being considered by the Shelby County Health Department calls for the use of 15 turbines, though the Southern Environmental Law Center says there are as many as 35 turbines located at the sprawling facility.",
      "Musk\u2019s xAI said the turbines will be equipped with technology to reduce emissions \u2014 and that it\u2019s already boosting the city\u2019s economy by investing billions of dollars in the supercomputer facility, paying millions in local taxes and creating hundreds of jobs. The company also is spending $35 million to build a power substation and $80 million to build a water recycling plant to the support Memphis, Light, Gas and Water, the local utility.",

      "The chamber of commerce in Memphis made a surprise announcement in June 2024 that xAI planned to build a supercomputer in the city. The data center quickly set up shop in an industrial park south Memphis, near factories and a gas-powered plant operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority.",
      "The SELC has claimed the use of the turbines violates the Clean Air Act and notes that residents who live near the xAI facility already face cancer risks at four times the national average. The group also has sent a petition to the Environmental Protection Agency.",

      "A federal appeals court in San Francisco is set to hear arguments on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California",

      "The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment.",
      "The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at noon, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected.",
      "U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump\u2019s statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA.",
      "The Trump administration argued the deployment was necessary to restore order and protect federal buildings and officers.",

      "The Senate is voting on legislation regulating a form of cryptocurrency called stablecoins",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate is expected to approve legislation Tuesday that would regulate a form of cryptocurrency known as stablecoins, the first of what is expected to be a wave of crypto legislation from Congress that the industry hopes will bolster its legitimacy and reassure consumers.",
      "The fast-moving legislation, which will be sent to the House for potential revisions, comes on the heels of a 2024 campaign cycle where the crypto industry ranked among the top political spenders in the country, underscoring its growing influence in Washington and beyond.",
      "Eighteen Democratic senators have shown support for the legislation as it has advanced, siding with the Republican majority in the 53-47 Senate. If passed, it would become the second major bipartisan bill to advance through the Senate this year, following the Laken Riley Act on immigration enforcement in January.",
      "Still, most Democrats oppose the bill. They have raised concerns that the measure does little to address President Donald Trump\u2019s personal financial interests in the crypto space.",
      "\u201cWe weren\u2019t able to include certainly everything we would have wanted, but it was a good bipartisan effort,\" said Sen. Angela Alsobrooks, D-Md., on Monday. She added, \u201cThis is an unregulated area that will now be regulated.\u201d",
      "Known as the GENIUS Act, the bill would establish guardrails and consumer protections for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The acronym stands for \u201cGuiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins.\u201d",
      "It's expected to pass Tuesday, since it only requires a simple majority vote \u2014 and it already cleared its biggest procedural hurdle last week in a 68-30 vote. But the bill has faced more resistance than initially expected.",
      "There is a provision in the bill that bans members of Congress and their families from profiting off stablecoins. But that prohibition does not extend to the president and his family, even as Trump builds a crypto empire from the White House.",
      "Trump hosted a private dinner last month at his golf club with top investors in a Trump-branded meme coin. His family holds a large stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that provides yet another avenue where investors are buying in and enriching the president\u2019s relatives. World Liberty has launched its own stablecoin, USD1.",
      "The administration is broadly supportive of crypto's growth and its integration into the economy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the legislation could help push the U.S. stablecoin market beyond $2 trillion by the end of 2028.",
      "Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase \u2014 the nation\u2019s largest crypto exchange and a major advocate for the bill \u2014 has met with Trump and praised his early moves on crypto. This past weekend, Coinbase was among the more prominent brands that sponsored a parade in Washington commemorating the Army\u2019s 250th anniversary \u2014 an event that coincided with Trump\u2019s 79th birthday.",
      "But the crypto industry emphasizes that they view the legislative effort as bipartisan, pointing to champions on each side of the aisle.",
      "\u201cThe GENIUS Act will be the most significant digital assets legislation ever to pass the U.S. Senate,\u201d Senate Banking Committee Chair Tim Scott, R-S.C., said ahead of a key vote last week. \u201cIt\u2019s the product of months of bipartisan work.\u201d",
      "The bill did hit one rough patch in early May, when a bloc of Senate Democrats who had previously supported the bill reversed course and voted to block it from advancing. That prompted new negotiations involving Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House, which ultimately produced the compromise version expected to win passage Tuesday.",
      "\u201cThere were many, many changes that were made. And ultimately, it\u2019s a much better deal because we were all at the table,\u201d Alsobrooks said.",
      "Still, the bill leaves unresolved concerns over presidential conflicts of interest \u2014 an issue that remains a source of tension within the Democratic caucus.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has been among the most outspoken as the ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee, warning that the bill creates a \u201csuper highway\u201d for Trump corruption. She has also warned that the bill would allow major technology companies, such as Amazon and Meta, to launch their own stablecoins.",
      "If the stablecoin legislation passes the Senate on Tuesday, it still faces several hurdles before reaching the president\u2019s desk. It must clear the narrowly held Republican majority in the House, where lawmakers may try to attach a broader market structure bill \u2014 sweeping legislation that could make passage through the Senate more difficult.",
      "Trump has said he wants stablecoin legislation on his desk before Congress breaks for its August recess, now just under 50 days away.",

      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Violence and fear swept through towns in an arc around Minneapolis for more than 40 hours over the weekend as a man seemingly intent on sowing political devastation killed one Minnesota state lawmaker and left another bleeding from nine bullet wounds.",
      "The attacks sparked the largest manhunt in Minnesota history, with heavily armed officers in full combat gear riding armored vehicles through suburban streets and country roads, ending in the arrest of Vance Boelter, a 57-year-old father of five and sometime Christian pastor known for his deeply conservative beliefs \u2014 but whose friends never saw him as an extremist.",
      "From a state that has long prided itself on political civility, the attacks rippled across the country as frightened political leaders worried that America\u2019s divides could cost them their lives.",
      "\u201cThis was a political assassination, which is not the word we use very often in the United States, let alone in Minnesota\u201d acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson told reporters Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s a chilling attack on our democracy, on our way of life.\u201d",
      "The black SUV\u2019s emergency lights were flashing when it pulled up to the brick split-level home in the quiet, middle-class Minneapolis suburb. The maple tree in the front yard was lush with summer leaves.",
      "The man got out of the car wearing tactical clothing, body armor and what looked like a police badge. He was carrying a 9 mm Beretta pistol.",
      "He knocked loudly and repeatedly shouted, \u201cThis is the police, open the door.\u201d",
      "Later, even law enforcement officials said they would have believed he was a police officer.",
      "The couple who lived at the Champlin home, Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, opened the door to a flashlight shining in their faces.",
      "There had been a report of a shooting in the house, Boelter told them. But when he eventually lowered the flashlight, Yvette Hoffman could see he was wearing a realistic mask that covered his entire head. In the confrontation that followed, he shot both repeatedly. The next morning, nine bullet holes could be seen in their front door.",
      "Police responded within minutes, after a 911 call from the Hoffman\u2019s adult daughter, who also lives in the house.",
      "The legislator and his wife were rushed to a nearby hospital.",
      "A little more than 10 miles (16 kilometers) away, security camera footage showed Boelter, still in his mask and tactical clothing, holding a flashlight as he rang the doorbell at the home of someone who authorities have so far only identified as \u201cPublic Official 1.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the police. Open the door,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cWe have a warrant.\u201d",
      "Boelter was traveling with a list of about 70 names, including prominent state and federal lawmakers, community leaders and abortion-rights advocates, according to two law enforcement officials who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the ongoing investigation.",
      "The federal affidavit says the list was composed of \u201cmostly or all Democrats.\u201d",
      "No one was at the Maple Grove home. Boelter soon left.",
      "But he had plenty of other targets. Boelter had carefully planned his attacks in advance, making notes about targets' families and conducting surveillance on their homes, Thompson said.",
      "\u201cBoelter stalked his victims like prey,\u201d he said.",
      "Roughly 5 miles (8 kilometers) away, in another suburb just north of Minneapolis, Boelter drove to the home of Democratic state Sen. Ann Rest.",
      "By then, law enforcement was starting to worry about local legislators and New Hope police dispatched an officer to do a safety check at Rest\u2019s home.",
      "That officer found what she thought was a police vehicle already doing a check, parked down the street from the house. When the officer tried to speak to Boelter, he stared straight ahead and didn\u2019t respond.",
      "The officer then drove to Rest\u2019s home, and after seeing no trouble waited for backup and returned to where Boelter had been parked.",
      "But by then he was gone.",
      "An off-duty sergeant with the Brooklyn Park police was leaving the station when he heard about the shooting at Hoffman\u2019s house.",
      "\u201c\u2019Hey, drive by Melissa Hortman\u2019s house and just check on the house, would you?\u201d he told a pair of officers, the city\u2019s police chief, Mark Bruley, told reporters. Hortman, 55, the former house speaker, had long been one of the state's leading Democrats.",
      "Boelter, his phony police car parked out front with its lights flashing, was standing at the front door of the large brick home when the real Brooklyn Park officers arrived.",
      "\u201cMoments after their arrival on scene, Boelter fired several gunshots as he moved forward, entering the Hortmans\u2019 home,\u201d the federal affidavit states. Moments later, he fired a second set of shots.",
      "The officers moved to the house and found a gravely injured Mark Hortman in the doorway. Inside the house, they found Melissa Hortman. She had also been badly shot.",
      "Both soon died.",
      "Left behind, though, was Boelter\u2019s car, with the list of targets and at least five weapons. Nearby, police found the mask Boelter had worn along with the pistol he\u2019d carried.",
      "Law enforcement believed he was on foot.",
      "\u201cDad went to war last night,\u201d said a message Boelter sent on a family group text, which his wife eventually shared with authorities. Police had found her by tracking her cellphone. They found her in a car with her children, along with two handguns, about $10,000 in cash and passports, the affidavit said.",
      "Boelter had apparently urged her to leave.",
      "\u201cWords are not going to explain how sorry I am,\u201d he said in another message. \u201cthere\u2019s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don\u2019t want you guys around.\u201d",
      "He also reached out to two roommates with whom he sometimes stayed in Minneapolis.",
      "\u201cMay be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn\u2019t gone this way,\u201d Boelter wrote, according to Paul Schroeder, who has known Boelter for years.",
      "Friends said Boelter had been struggling financially in recent years. In 2023, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies from assisted-living facilities. That job ended about four months ago.",
      "Within hours of the Hortman shooting, hundreds of police officers, sheriff deputies and FBI agents were roaming the streets near the scene.",
      "Cellphones in the area pinged an alert, urging people near the Hortmans\u2019 neighborhood to take shelter. \u201cPolice are still looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,\" the alert said, giving a description of Boelter. \u201cDo not approach.\u201d",
      "A series of roadblocks was also set up, with law enforcement searching every vehicle as it left, fearing Boelter could try to escape by hiding in a car.",
      "Carrying two duffel bags, Boelter approached a man he didn\u2019t know at a Minneapolis bus stop roughly 7 miles (11 kilometers) from the Hortmans\u2019 home and asked to purchase his electric bike. After taking the bus together to the man\u2019s home, Boelter agreed to buy the bike and the man\u2019s Buick sedan. They then drove the Buick to a bank branch in nearby Robbinsdale, where Boelter, who can be seen in security footage wearing a cowboy hat, withdrew $2,200, emptying his bank account. He paid the man $900.",
      "Law enforcement received a report of someone riding an e-bike on a country road outside the small town of Green Isle, about an hour from downtown Minneapolis.",
      "The cyclist was not found, but Boelter\u2019s family lives not far away, in a sprawling 3,800-square-foot house they bought in 2023 for more than $500,000.",
      "The Buick was found, abandoned, near where the cyclist had been spotted.",
      "Worried about explosives, law enforcement initially used a robot to check the car. Inside, they found the cowboy hat that Boelter appeared to be wearing in the bank.",
      "There was also a handwritten letter addressed to the FBI in which Boelter said he was \u201cthe shooter at large in Minnesota involved in the 2 shootings.\u201d",
      "Law enforcement set up a large perimeter near Green Isle after a police officer thought he'd seen Boelter running into the woods. Twenty tactical teams were called in for an intensive search.",
      "For hours, heavily armed men, some with dogs, walked the roads and fields of rural Sibley County. A helicopter was called in to help.",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- On the 105th day of what was supposed to be a 60-day session, Florida lawmakers gave final approval to a leaner state budget totaling $115.1 billion, marking the end of a lawmaking season that was largely defined by inter-party clashes in the Republican-dominated capitol.",
      "The new budget lacks some of the top priorities of legislative leaders and Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, coming in $500 million less than the governor's proposed budget, and $3.5 billion less than last year's adjusted total, a goal of conservative lawmakers focused on scaling back state spending amid concerns of a broader economic slowdown.",
      "The state's legislative leaders had debated for weeks over competing tax cut proposals, initially pushing for broad sales tax relief for everyday Floridians before settling on a package that mostly benefits businesses.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t view this on day 105 as a failure,\u201d Republican Senate President Ben Albritton said. \u201cWe dug in deep.\u201d",
      "The budget now goes to the governor, who has the power to veto individual line items and is known for slashing into lawmakers\u2019 spending plans.",
      "Here's a look at Florida's budget by the numbers.",
      "While political and tropical storms loom on the horizon, Florida's legislative leaders have largely downplayed concerns about how President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive and unpredictable economic policies could impact the state's budget, even as he pledges to phase out the federal agency that responds to hurricanes and other disasters that batter the state.",
      "But lawmakers have taken steps to shore up reserves, as forecasters warn of a busier than usual hurricane season and as economists fret over Trump's trade wars and a sweeping proposal to cut federal taxes and spending.",
      "Lawmakers crafted a compromise budget and tax cut package, which would save taxpayers and reduce state revenues by an estimated $1.3 billion a year, according to legislative staff. They've also taken steps to set aside an additional $750 million a year into a reserve fund for emergencies, pending voter approval.",
      "Republican House Speaker Daniel Perez said building up the reserves is about \"being prepared for the unexpected.\"",
      "\u201cNone of us know what the future holds,\u201d Perez said.",
      "The legislature advanced a proposed constitutional amendment that would set aside $750 million a year \u2014 or an amount equal to up to 25% of the state\u2019s general revenue, whichever is less \u2014 into a reserve fund that lawmakers could only use for emergencies. The measure has to be approved by 60% of Florida voters to be implemented.",
      "The last time state officials tapped into the budget stabilization fund was in 2008, as the Great Recession blasted through Florida's tourism and development-heavy economy. Boosting the reserves is a prudent move, said Republican House Budget Committee Chair Lawrence McClure, and another way to cut state spending.",
      "\u201cWe are doing this so that are we are truly prepared for a break the glass situation,\u201d McClure said.",
      "Democrats have called the reserve fund a \u201clock box\u201d and said lawmakers should keep the funds on hand to support needy Floridians, at a time when many residents are priced out of their homes and schools and prisons are struggling to keep staff on the job.",
      "The Florida House had initially called for cutting the state's overall sales tax from 6% to 5.25%. A competing offer in the state Senate called for a tax break on clothing purchases under $75. Instead, the largest tax break lawmakers approved was for companies, by eliminating the state's business rent tax. They also approved tax cuts for a slate of special interests including casinos, airlines and NASCAR.",
      "Florida residents will get sales tax relief on hurricane supplies, sunscreen and bug spray, and a tax exemption on clothes and school supplies each August.",
      "State lawmakers are setting aside $4 billion for scholarships for private and religious education, two years after the Legislature expanded the state's voucher program to make all K-12 students eligible, regardless of family income. Since then, the state's indirect spending on private school tuition and homeschooling costs has risen dramatically, which critics warn is burning through the state's budget.",
      "Part of state lawmakers' push to cut back on what they see as government bloat is eliminating 2,238 vacant positions across state agencies from the department of health to the department of children and families. Many of the positions being cut have been vacant for three months.",
      "While the number of state jobs shrinks, state workers will receive an across-the-board 2% raise, while state law enforcement officers and firefighters will get a 10% total raise, and a 15% raise if they've been on the job for at least five years.",
      "The Legislature is also setting aside $3 million in grants for local jails that have contracted with the federal government to support immigration enforcement efforts. Florida has rushed to help the Trump administration carry out its mass deportation agenda and now leads the country in the number of local and state agencies signing on with the federal government to deputize their officers to carry out immigration enforcement.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- After a calm night in downtown Los Angeles, Mayor Karen Bass on Monday slightly trimmed the hours of a curfew imposed last week after days of violent protests and looting that followed President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown.",
      "Bass' announcement that the nightly curfew would be narrowed \u2014 it will start at 10 p.m. Monday, rather than at 8 p.m., and extend until 6 a.m. Tuesday \u2014 followed the disclosure that there were no arrests by police in the area on Sunday.",
      "The mayor's office said the slightly trimmed curfew time reflects a marked reduction in violence, vandalism and looting in downtown that followed the protests. When the curfew was imposed on June 10, officials said it was necessary to stop vandalism and theft by agitators looking to cause trouble. At the time, Bass said the city \"reached a tipping point\u201d after 23 businesses were looted.",
      "In a statement Monday, Bass said \u201cthe curfew, coupled with ongoing crime prevention efforts, have been largely successful in protecting stores, restaurants, businesses and residential communities from bad actors who do not care about the immigrant community.\u201d",
      "Bass has given no indication when the curfew will end.",

The verdict reached in April was the first of dozens of lawsuits filed in 2013 against leading oil and gas companies in Louisiana alleging they violated state environmental laws for decades.",
      "While plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys say the appeal encompasses at least 10 cases, Chevron disagrees and says the court\u2019s ruling could have broader implications for additional lawsuits.",

      "NEW YORK -- Attorneys for the Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil requested that a federal judge immediately release him on bail, or else transfer him to New Jersey to be closer to his family, as the Trump administration seeks to keep him in custody in Louisiana.",
      "The latest request, filed Monday afternoon, follows a whirlwind week in the legal case against Khalil, a lawful permanent resident who has been detained since March on allegations that his presence in the country poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "While the judge, Michael Farbiarz, ruled that Khalil could not be deported for that reason, he declined Friday to grant Khalil's release, pointing to a secondary rationale advanced by the government: that he had omitted information on his green card application about his work history and affiliations.",
      "In their filing, lawyers for Khalil said the government\u2019s move to keep him detained on those grounds was \u201cexceedingly rare and extremely unusual,\u201d reflecting the retaliatory nature of their case. Khalil has strongly disputed that he was not forthcoming on the application.",
      "If the release is not granted, Khalil\u2019s attorneys urged the judge to at least transfer him to a detention facility in New Jersey so he could be closer to his wife and newborn son.",

      "An ICE official previously denied the transfer request. Last month, the government sought to block Khalil from holding his 1-month-old son, arguing that their first meeting should be \u201cnon-contact.\u201d",
      "Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was detained at his Manhattan apartment on March 8, becoming the first target of President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on those who joined protests against the war in Gaza.",
      "He has not been accused of a crime. Rather, the Trump administration has argued that Khalil should be expelled from the country for beliefs that could undermine their foreign policy goals around fighting anti-semitism.",
      "The allegations that Khalil lied on his green card application were added after his arrest, and have been strongly contested by Khalil and his lawyers.",
      "While the government claimed he served as an \u201cofficer\u201d of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, Khalil has denied that, claiming he completed an internship at the agency that was approved by Columbia University.",
      "He said the government also overstated the length of time he had worked for the British Embassy.",
      "In a previous ruling, the federal judge said it was \u201coverwhelmingly unlikely\u201d that the government would seek to detain Khalil solely on charges that he misrepresented himself on the application.",
      "Still, the judge said Khalil\u2019s lawyers had not presented sufficient evidence countering the claims and proving that he was being held illegally.",
      "\u201cThe government is making desperate, last-ditch attempts to keep my husband unjustly imprisoned,\u201d said Noor Abdalla, Khalil\u2019s wife, in a statement Monday. \u201cWe are not afraid and will not be intimidated, because we know, and the government knows, it is only a matter of time before Mahmoud is free.\"",

      "The hotly debated project is near the federally protected Okefenokee Swamp.",
      "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- A company that has spent years battling conservationists as it seeks a permit to mine outside the Okefenokee Swamp and its federally protected wildlife refuge needs to do just one thing before regulators make a final decision: set aside $2 million for future restoration of the mining site.",
      "Sixteen months after being notified of the requirement, Twin Pines Minerals still hasn't submitted a surety bond or equivalent financial assurance to show the Georgia Environmental Protection Division that it has access to that amount of cash or credit.",
      "That's brought an unexpected halt to a project that appeared on the cusp of winning final approval early last year. Georgia regulators issued draft permits in February 2024 despite warnings from scientists that mining so close to the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge could irreparably harm a national treasure.",
      "Twin Pines of Birmingham, Alabama, has worked since 2019 to obtain permits to mine titanium dioxide, a pigment used to whiten products from paint to toothpaste, less than 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the southeastern boundary of the Okefenokee refuge near the Georgia-Florida line.",
      "Within days of the draft permits being approved, Georgia regulators informed Twin Pines in a letter that it needed to submit a $2 million bond, cash or letter of credit that can be used as needed to pay for restoration of the 820-acre (332-hectare) site.",
      "Regulators have finished reviewing thousands of public comments that poured in a year ago regarding the mining project in Georgia's Charlton County, said Environmental Protection Division spokeswoman Sara Lips. Now they're waiting on Twin Pines before moving forward.",
      "\u201cThe financial assurance is the last piece of the permit package that will then get routed to our staff, up to the director, to make a final decision,\" Lips told The Associated Press. She said Twin Pines faces no deadline to put up the money.",
      "Twin Pines President Steve Ingle declined to comment through a company spokesman. Ingle has insisted Twin Pines can mine without harming the Okefenokee. State regulators have agreed, concluding last year that mining should have a \u201cminimal impact\u201d on the refuge.",
      "The mining company's failure to set aside the $2 million after well over a year has opponents questioning whether it has the resources to mine responsibly in an ecologically sensitive area.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about the potential damage of this mine, it goes way beyond $2 million,\" said Peter Slag, an attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center. \u201cIt's sort of an alarm bell that they probably don\u2019t have the money to do other sorts of compliance and capital investment.\u201d",
      "The Okefenokee is the largest U.S. refuge east of the Mississippi River, covering nearly 630 square miles (1,630 square kilometers) in southeast Georgia. It is home to abundant alligators, stilt-legged wood storks and more than 400 other animal species.",
      "Scientists have warned that mining near the Okefenokee\u2019s bowl-like rim could damage the swamp\u2019s ability to hold water and increase the frequency of withering droughts.",
      "There are other signs Twin Pines may be struggling financially.",
      "Danish shipping company Lauritzen Bulkers sued Twin Pines in federal court in Colorado last October, saying it's owed $9.3 million after contracting with Twin Pines in 2022 to transport minerals to Asia. A judge paused the case in April, at the shipper's request, amid arbitration proceedings.",
      "Twin Pines' attorney in that case, Joseph Martinez, did not immediately return email messages seeking comment.",
      "In March, a second company sued Twin Pines in a California state court. M&L Commodities says Twin Pines owes it $5.6 million stemming from a 2021 contract for M&L to store minerals for the mining company. Twin Pines denies wrongdoing in legal responses filed in court.",

      "Arthur Folasa Ah Loo was killed when a man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the protest shot at a person brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, accidentally striking Ah Loo. Ah Loo later died at the hospital, authorities said.",
      "Detectives don\u2019t yet know why the alleged rifleman pulled out a weapon or ran from the peacekeepers, but they charged him with murder and accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo\u2019s death, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference.",
      "Ah Loo leaves behind his wife and two young children, according to a GoFundMe for his family that raised over $100,000 in 48 hours.",
      "The \u201cself-taught\u201d fashion designer born in Samoa, known to many as Afa, devoted his life to doing \u201cthe good things for his neighbors and community,\" state Rep. Verona Mauga said.",
      "Mauga was at the \u201cNo Kings Protest\u201d a few blocks from where Ah Loo was shot. She said she only had a sense that something was wrong when she saw the crowd running.",
      "As tragic as his death is, she said, Ah Loo would have been proud that his last moments were spent fighting for what he believed in.",
      "\u201cIf Afa was going to go out any other way than natural causes, it would be standing up for marginalized and vulnerable communities and making sure that people had a voice,\u201d Mauga told The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "While he wasn't typically overtly political, Ah Loo had a knack for connecting \u201cculture and diversity and service,\u201d and bringing people together, Mauga said.",
      "Ah Loo was a co-founder of the nonprofit Create Pacific, which celebrates and uplifts artists from the Pacific Islands. He was working on an upcoming July fashion show when he died.",
      "Ah Loo's vibrant work has earned numerous accolades over the years. He was a contestant in 2017 on Bravo\u2019s \u201cProject Runway,\u201d a reality television show where fashion designers compete in front of celebrity judges to create runway looks on tight deadlines.",
      "Recently, Ah Loo designed a garment for the star of the Disney Channel animated movie Moana 2, Hawaiian actor Auli\u02bbi Cravalho.",
      "Cravalho wore the outfit, which combined traditional and modern aesthetics from her culture, to the film's red carpet premiere in Hawaii last November.",
      "\u201cThis was the first time I was so active in helping to design a custom look, and Afa surpassed what I had envisioned,\u201d Cravalho told the magazine at the time.",
      "But not all of his work was high-profile, Mauga said.",
      "Ah Loo would volunteer his time and resources to tailor clothing for people who needed help, often refusing to let people compensate him for his work, Mauga said. Sometimes, Ah Loo would playfully criticize the outfits the newly elected Democratic representative wore on the campaign trail, and invite her to his studio so he could make her a new set of blazers. He would also make her dresses for events, sometimes just on a couple of hours notice.",
      "\u201cAfa was so much a part of the community,\u201d she said.",

      "About 50 residents on Hawaii's Maui island evacuated their homes as a fast-moving brush fire fueled by strong winds encroached on their rural community",
      "HONOLULU -- A fast-moving Hawaii brush fire fueled by fierce winds forced the evacuation of about 50 Maui residents on the opposite side of the same island where a devastating blaze killed over 100 people two years ago.",
      "The fire started Sunday in a sparsely populated area with land set aside for Native Hawaiians.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about the fire so far:",
      "The Kahikinui was initially estimated at 500 acres (202 hectares), but aerial surveys overnight put the estimate at about 330 acres (134 hectares), Maui's fire department said. The fire is 85% contained.",
      "The remote, challenging terrain made it difficult to estimate the fire's size, the department said in a statement. A police drone showed hot spots, but none flared overnight.",
      "No injuries or structural damage was reported. Weather conditions were mostly sunny Monday with a high of 67 degrees Fahrenheit (19 degrees Celsius) and east winds of about 15 mph (24 kph), gusting up to about 25 mph (40 kph).",
      "The U.S. Drought Monitor says all of Maui is in drought.",
      "Authorities conducted door-to-door evacuations and part of a highway remains closed.",
      "Warren Aganos was on his family\u2019s Hawaiian Homelands lot preparing to go on a Father\u2019s Day hunt when a neighbor called him around 9 a.m. telling him a fire had broken out.",
      "\u201cI hung up and raced out, I didn\u2019t let her finish,\u201d said Aganos, who has been slowly rebuilding the three structures his family lost in a 2016 brush fire that burned over 5,000 acres (2,000 hectares) in the same area. \u201cI was thinking about the last one,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was super emotional.\u201d",
      "Aganos said he rushed in his truck to make sure first responders knew where the community\u2019s water storage tanks were before navigating Kahikinui\u2019s dirt roads down to the highway where he could see smoke billowing over the hillside. The community lacks electrical and water infrastructure, and some of the roads are only navigable by four-wheel drive.",
      "State and local leaders signed emergency proclamations so that the Hawaii National Guard can help and counties can access assistance.",
      "Kahikinui is less populated and developed than Lahaina, which was the Hawaiian Kingdom's capital in the 1800s and is now a popular tourist destination. Kahikinui was used for cattle ranching for many years and is near a state forest reserve.",
      "The fire department sent engines, tankers and a helicopter to battle the blaze. Three bulldozers cut firebreaks in the lower part of the community, Desiree Graham, co-chair of Kahikinui\u2019s firewise committee, said.",
      "The area has 104 Hawaiian homeland lots of 10 to 20 acres (4 to 8 hectares) each. About 40 lots have homes, including 15 with full-time residents. Some lots have more than one home, Graham said.",
      "A state agency issues lot leases under a program Congress created in 1921 to help Native Hawaiians become economically self-sufficient. Those with at least 50% Hawaiian blood quantum can apply for a 99-year lease for $1 a year.",
      "Maui is still recovering from the massive inferno that enveloped Lahaina in August 2023.",
      "That fire was the deadliest in the U.S. in more than a century. It destroyed thousands of properties and caused an estimated $5.5 billion  in damage. University of Hawaii researchers say unemployment and poverty rose after the blaze.",
      "The Kahikinui fire may seem small compared to continental U.S. fires, but it\u2019s significant for an island of 735 square miles (1,903 square kilometers).",
      "Crews also are battling wildfires in the Pacific Northwest, around the Great Basin, in California and the Rockies.",
      "National Weather Service forecasters and federal land managers have warned in recent weeks that fire danger is escalating in many places amid rising daytime temperatures and single-digit humidity levels.",
      "The risks won\u2019t start to wane \u2014 at least in the southwestern U.S. \u2014 until the monsoon starts to kick in, bringing much-needed rain. In southern New Mexico, a wildfire ballooned to nearly 30 square miles (78 square kilometers) over the weekend in the Gila National Forest.",
      "The flames forced the evacuations of homes that dot the mountains north of Silver City, blocked access to the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument and prompted air quality warnings as smoke drifted north. Campgrounds and access points to the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail also were closed.",
      "In Oregon, several dozen homes in Wasco County were destroyed by a fire that started last Wednesday. Some evacuations remained, but fire managers said Monday that the threat to structures had diminished.",
      "So far this year, the nation has seen double the number of fires as last year but the acreage is less, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. More than 2,700 wildland firefighters and support personnel were assigned to 15 large wildfires across the country.",
      "\u2014-",
      "This story has been corrected to show that 40 of the 104 lots in Kahikinui have homes on them, including 15 with full-time residents, and some lots have more than one home. It has also been corrected to reflect that Congress created the Hawaiian homelands program in 1921, not 1920.",

      "Faust was among several farmers who successfully sued the Biden administration in 2021 for race discrimination in the USDA's Farmer Loan Forgiveness Plan.",
      "The new lawsuit alleges the government has continued to implement diversity, equity and inclusion programs that were instituted under former President Joe Biden. The Wisconsin Institute wrote to the USDA in April warning of legal action, and six Republican Wisconsin congressmen called on the USDA to investigate and end the programs.",
      "\u201cThe USDA should honor the President\u2019s promise to the American people to end racial discrimination in the federal government,\u201d Faust said in a written statement. \u201cAfter being ignored by a federal agency that\u2019s meant to support agriculture, I hope my lawsuit brings answers, accountability, and results from USDA.\u201d",
      "Trump administration spokesperson Anna Kelly did not immediately respond to an email Monday seeking comment.",
      "The lawsuit contends that Faust is one of 2 million white male American farmers who are subject to discriminatory race-based policies at the USDA.",
      "The lawsuit names three USDA programs and policies it says put white men at a disadvantage and violate the Constitution\u2019s guarantee of equal treatment by discriminating based on race and sex.",
      "Faust participates in one program designed to offset the gap between milk prices and the cost of feed, but the lawsuit alleges he is charged a $100 administrative fee that minority and female farmers do not have to pay.",
      "Faust also participates in a USDA program that guarantees 90% of the value of loans to white farmers, but 95% to women and racial minorities. That puts Faust at a disadvantage, the lawsuit alleges.",
      "Faust has also begun work on a new manure storage system that could qualify for reimbursement under a USDA environmental conservation program, but 75% of his costs are eligible while 90% of the costs of minority farmers qualify, the lawsuit contends.",
      "A federal court judge ruled in a similar 2021 case that granting loan forgiveness only to \u201csocially disadvantaged farmers\u201d amounts to unconstitutional race discrimination. The Biden administration suspended the program and Congress repealed it in 2022.",
      "The Wisconsin Institute has filed dozens of such lawsuits in 25 states attacking DEI programs in government. In its April letter to the USDA, the law firm that has a long history of representing Republicans said it didn't want to sue \u201cbut there is no excuse for this continued discrimination.\u201d",

      "Canceled federal grants and businesses moving away from so-called brand activism have hit the bottom line of parades and other events heading into Thursday\u2019s federal holiday, which celebrates the end of slavery in the United States. The shrinking financial support coincides with many companies severing ties with LGBTQ celebrations for Pride this year and President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to squash DEI programs throughout the federal government.",
      "In Denver, for example, more than a dozen companies backed out of supporting the Juneteenth Music Festival, which is one of the city\u2019s biggest celebrations of the holiday, according to Norman Harris, executive director of JMF Corporation, which puts on the event.",
      "\u201cThere were quite a few sponsors who pulled back their investments or let us know they couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t be in a position to support this year,\" said Harris, who has overseen the event for more than a decade.",
      "The festival, which takes place in the historically Black Five Points neighborhood, has been scaled back to one day instead of two because of the budget shortfall. It has only been able to stay afloat thanks to donations from individuals and foundations.",
      "\u201cThankfully, there was a wide range of support that came when we made the announcement that the celebration is in jeopardy,\u201d Harris said.",

      "It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2014 after Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation",
      "It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed \u2014 after the Civil War's end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s Emancipation Proclamation.",
      "The resulting Juneteenth holiday \u2014 it's name combining \u201cJune\u201d and \u201cnineteenth\u201d \u2014 has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday \u2014 expanding its recognition beyond Black America.",
      "This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.",
      "Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.",
      "\u201cI don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\u201d said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \u201cI've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\u201d",
      "People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \u201cright\u201d way to celebrate Juneteenth?",
      "For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:",
      "It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans\u2019 true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \u201cBlack Codes,\u201d enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.",
      "Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.",
      "Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.",
      "Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.",
      "\u201cThe most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question \u2018What is Juneteenth?\u2019\u201d Morial said.",
      "Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn\u2019t learn about it until his 30s.",
      "\u201cI think many folks haven\u2019t known about it \u2014 who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn\u2019t celebrate it,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cIt was like just a part of history. It wasn\u2019t a celebration of history.\u201d",
      "For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn\u2019t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.",
      "Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you\u2019ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth\u2019s history.",
      "The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.",
      "The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.",
      "More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.",
      "Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.",
      "In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.",
      "\u201cI would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\u201d Morial said. \u201cIf you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\u201d",
      "Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there\u2019s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you\u2019re not Black. In fact, embrace it.",
      "\u201cI would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\u201d Brown said. \u201cIt absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn\u2019t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\u201d",
      "Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.",
      "\u201cBecause 1776, Fourth of July, where we\u2019re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\u201d Brown said. \u201cBlack people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s typical to wish people a \u201cHappy Juneteenth\u201d or \u201cHappy Teenth,\u201d according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.",
      "\u201cYou know how at Christmas people will say \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 to each other and not even know each other?\u201d Freeman said. \u201cYou can get a \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 from everybody. This is the same way.\u201d",

      "Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of Trump\u2019s immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed immigration officers to pause arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels, after Trump expressed alarm about the impact aggressive enforcement is having on those industries, according to a U.S. official familiar with the matter who spoke only on condition of anonymity.",
      "Protests over federal immigration enforcement raids have been flaring up around the country.",
      "Opponents of Trump's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \u201cno kings\u201d demonstrations Saturday that came as Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army.",
      "Saturday's protests were mostly peaceful.",
      "But police in Los Angeles used tear gas and crowd-control munitions to clear out protesters after the event ended.",

      "Vance Luther Boelter, 57, was captured late Sunday following a two-day manhunt authorities described as the largest in the state's history. Boelter is accused of impersonating a police officer and gunning down former House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, in their home outside Minneapolis. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz described the shooting as \u201ca politically motivated assassination.\u201d",

The list also included the names of abortion rights advocates and health care officials, according to two law enforcement officials who could not discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.",

Still, in three lengthy sermons reviewed by the AP, he only mentioned abortion once, focusing more on his love of God and what he saw as the moral decay in his native country.",
      "He appears to have hidden his more strident beliefs from his friends back home.",
      "\u201cHe never talked to me about abortion,\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cIt seemed to be just that he was a conservative Republican who naturally followed Trump.\u201d",

      "After getting an undergraduate degree in international relations in his 20s, Boelter went back to school and earned a master\u2019s degree and then a doctorate in leadership studies in 2016 from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic college in Wisconsin that has since shut down. While living in Wisconsin, records show Boelter and his wife Jenny founded a nonprofit corporation called Revoformation Ministries, listing themselves as the president and secretary.",
      "After moving to Minnesota about a decade ago, Boelter volunteered for a position on a state workforce development board, first appointed by then-Gov. Mark Dayton, a Democrat, in 2016, and later by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. He served through 2023.",
      "In that position, he may have crossed paths with one of his alleged victims. Hoffman served on the same board, though authorities said it was not immediately clear how much the two men may have interacted.",

A website for Praetorian Guard Security Services lists Boelter\u2019s wife as the president and CEO while he is listed as the director of security patrols.

Another photo shows a man in black tactical gear with a military-style helmet and a ballistic vest with the company\u2019s name across the front.",

      "\u201cIt has been a very fun and rewarding experience and I only wished I had done something like this 10 years ago,\u201d he wrote in a message shared with the AP.",
      "But once he returned home in 2023, there were signs that Boelter was struggling financially. That August, he began working for a transport service for a funeral home, mostly picking up bodies of those who had died in assisted living facilities \u2014 a job he described as he needed to do to pay bills. Tim Koch, the owner of Metro First Call, said Boelter \u201cvoluntarily left\u201d that position about four months ago.",

      "FBI officials say two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large",
      "NEWARK, N.J. -- Two detainees who escaped from a federal immigration detention center in New Jersey last week have been recaptured, while another two remain at large, FBI officials said Sunday.",
      "The four men busted out of the Delaney Hall detention center in Newark during reports of disorder there by breaking through an interior wall that led to an exterior one, and were able to escape from a parking lot, according to U.S. Sen. Andy Kim, a New Jersey Democrat, and Homeland Security officials.",
      "The FBI said Joel Enrique Sandoval-Lopez and Joan Sebastian Castaneda-Lozada were taken back into custody since Friday, while Franklin Norberto Bautista-Reyes and Andres Felipe Pineda-Mogollon were still on the lam. Officials did not immediately say how or where the two who are back in custody were caught. All four men were in the country illegally and had previously been charged with crimes by local police in New Jersey and New York City, Homeland Security officials said.",
      "Sandoval-Lopez, from Honduras, was charged with unlawful possession of a handgun in October and aggravated assault in February, officials said. Castaneda-Lozada, from Colombia, was charged with burglary, theft and conspiracy, authorities said.",
      "Bautista-Reyes, from Honduras, was charged in May with aggravated assault, attempt to cause bodily injury, terroristic threats and a weapon crime. Pineda-Mogollon, from Colombia, was charged with minor larceny and burglary crimes. The FBI has announced a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of each man.",
      "A spokesperson for the New Jersey public defenders' office, which represented Sandoval-Lopez, did not immediately return an email seeking comment Sunday. Attorney information for the other three men could not be located on online court records.",
      "Newark\u2019s mayor, Ras Baraka, a Democrat who\u2019s been critical of President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown, cited reports of a possible uprising and escape after disorder broke out at the facility Thursday night and protesters outside the center locked arms and pushed against barricades as vehicles passed through gates. Much is still unclear about what unfolded there.",
      "But GEO Group, the company that owns and operates the detention facility for the federal government, said in a statement that there was \u201cno widespread unrest\u201d at the facility.",
      "Delaney Hall has been the site of clashes this year between Democratic officials who say the facility needs more oversight and the Trump administration and those who run the facility.",
      "Baraka was arrested May 9, handcuffed and charged with trespassing. The charge was later dropped and U.S. Democratic Rep. LaMonica McIver was later charged with assaulting federal officers stemming from a skirmish that happened outside the facility. She has denied the charges.",

    "story": [
      "Salt Lake City police say a demonstrator who was shot at the city's \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest has died and that the bullet that killed him appears to have been fired by one of the demonstration's peacekeepers",
      "A man who was believed to be part of a peacekeeping team for the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest in Salt Lake City shot at a person who was brandishing a rifle at demonstrators, striking both the rifleman and a bystander who later died at the hospital, authorities said Sunday.",
      "Police took the alleged rifleman, Arturo Gamboa, 24, into custody Saturday evening on a murder charge, Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd said at a Sunday news conference. The bystander was Arthur Folasa Ah Loo, 39, a fashion designer from Samoa.",
      "Detectives don't yet know why Gamboa pulled out a rifle or ran from the peacekeepers, but they accused him of creating the dangerous situation that led to Ah Loo's death. The Associated Press did not immediately find an attorney listed for Gamboa or contact information for his family in public records.",
      "Redd said the man believed to be part of the peacekeeping team, dressed in a neon green vest, fired three shots from a handgun at Gamboa, inflicting a relatively minor injury but fatally shooting Ah Loo. Redd did not share the man's name.",
      "Volunteer peacekeeping teams are common for protests, said Sarah Parker, a national coordinator for 50501 Movement, which was a partner in the \u201cNo Kings\u201d protest. But the organizers ask attendees, including the peacekeepers, not to bring weapons, she said. Still, Parker said they stopped what could've been a larger mass casualty event.",
      "\u201cOur safety team did as best as they could in a situation that is extremely sad and extremely scary,\" said Parker.",
      "Ah Loo, known as Afa, was a husband and father to two children and a fashion designer who leaned into his Samoan heritage, according to a GoFundMe page organized to support his family. Ah Loo founded Creative Pacific, an event celebrating the diversity of the Pacific Islands, with workshops, artists and a fashion runway. He was on Season 17 of the fashion design reality TV show \u201cProject Runway.\u201d",
      "The gunshots sent hundreds of protesters running, some hiding behind barriers and fleeing into parking garages and nearby businesses, police said in a statement. \u201cThat's a gun. Come on, come on, get out,\" someone can be heard saying in a video posted to social media that appears to show the events.",
      "\u201cNo Kings\u201d protests swept across the country on Saturday, and organizers said millions rallied against what they described as President Donald Trump's authoritarian tendencies.",
      "Confrontations were largely isolated. In Riverside, California, authorities said a driver of an SUV struck a woman who was participating in a demonstration and sped away. The woman had \u201csignificant injuries\u201d but was stable, police said, adding that they were still searching for the driver.",
      "Outside the Arizona statehouse, a social media video showed protesters Saturday jeering at and then skirmishing with a masked man, who eventually pulled out a handgun, causing the crowd to scatter. Another video showed Arizona Department of Public Safety officers taking the man into custody.",
      "The shooter and another person in a neon vest allegedly saw Gamboa separate from the crowd of marchers in downtown Salt Lake City, move behind a wall and withdraw a rifle around 8 p.m., Redd said.",
      "When the two men in vests confronted Gamboa with their handguns drawn, witnesses said Gamboa raised his rifle into a firing position and ran toward the crowd, said Redd.",
      "That's when one of the men dressed in the vests shot three rounds, hitting Gamboa and Ah Loo, said Redd. Gamboa, who police said didn't have a criminal history, was wounded and treated before being booked into jail.",
      "Redd said that the peacekeepers\u2019 actions are also part of the investigation.",
      "Police said they recovered an AR-15 style rifle, a gas mask and a backpack at the scene.",

    "story": [
      "A doctor charged with giving Matthew Perry ketamine in the month leading up to the \"Friends\" star's overdose death will plead guilty, according to an agreement filed in court Monday.",
      "Dr. Salvador Plasencia agreed to plead guilty to four counts of distribution of ketamine, according to the signed document filed in federal court in Los Angeles. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors agreed to drop three additional counts of distribution of ketamine and two counts of falsifying records.",
      "Federal prosecutors said in a statement that the plea carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. They said Plasencia is expected to formally plead guilty in the coming weeks.",
      "According to a co-defendant, Plasencia in a text message called the actor a \"moron\" who could be exploited for money.",
      "The physician had been one of the primary targets of the prosecution, along with a woman accused of being a ketamine dealer. Three other defendants, including another doctor, agreed to plead guilty last year in exchange for their cooperation.",
      "Plasencia and the woman, Jasveen Sangha, had been scheduled to face trial in August. An email to his attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.",
      "Perry, 54, was found unresponsive and floating face-down in his jacuzzi on\u00a0Oct. 28, 2023, according to\u00a0an autopsy report\u00a0from the Los Angeles County medical examiner. His cause of death was \"the acute effects of ketamine,\" with contributing factors including drowning, coronary artery disease, and the effects of buprenorphine, a medication used to treat opioid addiction.",
      "Ketamine is a Schedule III hallucinogen. It is a controlled substance with legitimate uses, but it is also used illegally, U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Martin Estrada told reporters during a news conference last year, CBS News Los Angeles reported.",
      "\"It can cause serious health effects, serious health problems including loss of consciousness, including spikes in blood pressure and respiratory issues that can deprive the brain of oxygen,\" Estrada said. \"For that reason, it is a drug that must be administered by medical professionals and the patient must be monitored closely.\"",
      "\"That did not occur here,\" he said.",
      "Perry had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression, which has become increasingly common. He began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him.",
      "Plasencia admitted in his plea agreement that another patient connected him with Perry, and that starting about a month before Perry's death, he illegally supplied the actor with 20 vials of ketamine totaling 100 mg of the drug, along with ketamine lozenges and syringes.",
      "He admitted to enlisting the other doctor, Mark Chavez, to supply the drug for him, according to the court filings.",
      "\"I wonder how much this moron will pay,\" Plasencia texted Chavez, according to Chavez's plea agreement. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between the Los Angeles area where Plasencia practiced and San Diego, where Chavez practiced, and exchanged several vials of ketamine, the filings said.",
      "After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia allegedly asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's \"go-to,\" prosecutors said.",
      "Plasencia admitted to visiting Perry's house twice and injecting him with ketamine. He also left ketamine behind and showed Perry's personal assistant, Kenneth Iwamasa, how to inject it, according to Iwamasa's plea agreement. The doctor later met up with Iwamasa and gave him more ketamine for Perry, according to the document.",
      "Perry was also getting ketamine from another source, Sangha, who prosecutors allege was a major dealer and supplied the dose that killed the actor.",
      "Sangha has pleaded not guilty \u2014 making her the only one of the five people charged in Perry's death who has not entered a plea agreement. She remains jailed as she awaits trial. Plasencia was freed on bond after his initial court appearances.",
      "Erik Fleming, a friend of Perry who said he acted as a middleman and drug messenger, has also pleaded guilty and has been cooperating with prosecutors.",
      "None of the defendants have yet been sentenced. Plasencia's plea deal makes no specific sentencing guarantees.",
      "Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on \"Friends,\" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit.",

      "In the new biography \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\" (Simon & Schuster), Todd S. Purdum explores the impact on American culture by the Cuban-born entertainer who (as husband and business partner of Lucille Ball) changed the rules of TV.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Mo Rocca's interview with Purdum on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" June 15!",
      "\"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television\"",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Prologue",
      "He was adored as the man who loved Lucy, the combustible Cuban bandleader whose spluttering Spanish and long-suffering straight man's frustration at the comic antics of his crazy wife softened into a loving embrace at the end of each episode. But Desi Arnaz was so much more than Ricky Ricardo. If Ball's brilliant clowning\u2014her beauty, her mimicry, her flexible face and fearless skill at physical comedy\u2014was the artistic spark that animated I Love Lucy, Arnaz's pioneering show-business acumen was the essential driving force be- hind it. He was, as NPR's Planet Money once put it, the man who \"invented television.\"",
      "\"There's a misconception that we\u2014that Desi wasn't all that important to the show,\" Madelyn Pugh Davis, the founding cowriter of I Love Lucy, would recall years after his death. \"And Desi was what made the show go. And he also knew that she was the tremendous talent. He knew that. But he was the driving force, and he was the one who held it together. People don't seem to realize that.\"",
      "Today, nearly four decades after his death, Arnaz the performer remains a widely recognizable figure\u2014\"one of the great personalities of all time,\" as his friend the dancer Ann Miller once put it. Much less well understood is the seminal role he played in the nascent years of television, helping to transform its production methods, and transforming himself, a successful but second-tier Latin bandleader, and his wife, a journeyman actress in mostly forgettable B movies, into cultural icons.",
      "It was Arnaz (and I Love Lucy's head writer and producer, Jess Oppenheimer) who assembled the world-class team of Hollywood technicians who figured out how to light and film the show in front of a live studio audience, with three cameras in sync at once\u2014a then-pathbreaking method that soon became an industry standard for situation comedies that endures to this day. It was his ability to preserve those episodes on crystalline black-and-white 35-millimeter film stock that led to the invention of the rerun and later to the syndication of long-running series to secondary markets. This innovation also made it possible for the center of network television production to move from New York to Los Angeles and created the business model that lasted unchallenged for the better part of seven decades, until the streaming era established a competing paradigm.",
      "\"I Love Lucy was a crucial part of entertainment in this country,\" said Norman Lear, the creator of the landmark situation comedy All in the Family and many other shows. \"Lucy and Desi\u2014I think it can be said they pretty much opened the door of Hollywood to America, and to the situation comedy. There was only one Lucy and one Desi, and between them, they knew what it took. He was a great businessman in the persona of a wonderful entertainer.\"",

    "summary": "The Cuban-born entertainer broke conventions when he co-starred with wife Lucille Ball in \"I Love Lucy,\" playing a straight-man sitcom dad. Now, a new biography reveals his lesser-known contributions to television.",
    "story": [
      "In the fall of 1951, television audiences were introduced to a show biz-obsessed redhead and her bandleader husband, played by the real-life couple Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz. While Lucy was undeniably the star on-camera, off-camera it was Desi, a refugee from Cuba with no connection to the world of entertainment, who would change the way television worked.",
      "The most significant thing about Arnaz that people don't know, according to biographer Todd Purdum, is that he and his colleagues made the decision to film \"I Love Lucy\" on 35mm black-and-white film, \"making possible its preservation, and essentially the invention of the rerun, and then syndication sales, and the whole modern way that television economics work.\"",
      "One of the most striking revelations in Purdum's book, \"Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television,\" is why the show was even created. \"It was partly created to save their marriage,\" he said. \"Desi was on the road, which enabled him to philander, and that bothered Lucy a great deal. She'd kind of reached the limits of her career in movies, and she'd gotten a radio show called 'My Favorite Husband,' in which she played a kind of a zany housewife, married to the fifth vice president of a bank. And CBS then said, 'We'd like this show to make the transition to television.' And Lucy said, 'Well, I only want to do a television show if Desi can be in it with me and play my husband.'\"",
      "CBS and sponsors were worried that audiences wouldn't accept them as a couple. (Never mind they'd been married for ten years.) Desi and Lucy also wanted to shoot the show in Los Angeles, where they'd laid down roots. Back then, New York City was the hub of television production.",
      "\"Everything was about the family,\" said daughter Lucie Arnaz, who was born just six weeks before her parents shot the first episode of \"I Love Lucy.\" \"It was always about, 'No, no, no. We have a plan. We wanna be together. We wanna be in California.' Which is crazy when you're nobody. He wasn't a big star. She was a decent star, you know, B pictures. And that they would put their foot down like that and say, 'Well, no, we don't wanna do that'? It's crazy!\"",
      "But Desi and Lucy were willing to gamble. CBS agreed to their terms only after the stars agreed to a pay cut. But in return, Arnaz demanded that the couple own the rights to the show. The gamble paid off: with the very first episode, America fell in love with Lucy and Desi.",
      "Lucy was 39. The man born Desiderio Arnaz was 33, and a world away from his upbringing as an only child to a prominent family in Santiago, Cuba. His father had been mayor of the city; his mother, the daughter of a cofounder of Bacardi Rum. During the Cuban Revolution of 1933, the family lost everything. Teenaged Desi and his father fled to Miami, and lived in a rat-infested warehouse.",
      "He referred to himself as a refugee, not an immigrant. \"He was dislocated; he was not a voluntary arrival on our shores,\" said Purdum. \"He came here as a result of tragedy, really. And I think he never got over that.\"",
      "But he could play the guitar. Hired by bandleader Xavier Cugat, Desi introduced nightclub audiences to the Afro-Cuban conga, and what became his signature song, \"Babalu.\"",
      "In 1940, Arnaz jumped to the big screen in \"Too Many Girls,\" where he met his match in co-star Lucille Ball. The two married six months later.",
      "\"I Love Lucy\" would make the couple very rich. It was Desi's idea to buy RKO Studios, which he and Lucy renamed Desilu, which became a television producing juggernaut, with more sound stages than MGM, 20th Century Fox or Warner Brothers. \"That was their peak,\" said Purdum. \"And then, it went downhill from there because of Desi's drinking, really.\"",
      "But drinking wasn't his only addiction. \"People say he had affairs,\" said Lucie. \"He never had an affair. He didn't even know these dames' names, you know? They were hookers.",
      "\"He loved my mother. He loved his family. It was a very unique, weird problem to have, and I think that's the reason she stayed with him so long, is that she understood it. I don't think I could do what she did. But somehow at the time, with what they had, with what they needed from each other, they stuck it out as long as they could.\"",
      "In 1960, when Lucie Arnaz was eight and her brother, Desi Jr., was seven, America's most famous couple announced the end of their show \u2013 and their marriage.",
      "\"We were at their house in Palm Springs,\" Lucie recalled. \"And they said that, 'We love each other, but the being-husband-and-wife part is broken. And we can't live together anymore.' And I remember that my brother said, 'But if it's broken, can't you just fix it? Can't you put stuff on it and fix it?' And they said, 'I don't think so.'",
      "\"The truth of it is, Mo, they were happier after they got divorced. The screaming and the arguing and all that stuff stopped,\" Lucie said.",
      "I asked, \"And when you were told, did you sort of instinctively become protective of your little brother?\"",
      "\"I wish you'd been my therapist growing up, Mo!\" Lucie laughed. \"I think mostly I sort of was very protective of my dad, believe it or not. I felt really sorry for my dad.\"",
      "Why? \"I don't know. I think because I felt like he was the one that got ousted. We were still in the house. And I felt like he got a lotta the blame. Even though I was too young to understand what it was all about, I knew that he had problems. I knew that he would, you know, drink sometimes. But that really became worse when I was older, when I was, like, a teenager. But I just felt bad for him.\"",
      "Both Ball and Arnaz remarried, he to family friend Edith Hirsch. Lucy went on to star in several TV shows. Desi produced the series \"The Mothers-in-Law,\" wrote an autobiography, and eventually got sober with the help of his son, himself a recovered drug abuser.",
      "\"It was fantastic,\" said Lucie. \"It, like, my greatest memory of him to this day, to have him, the guy who said, 'I don't air my dirty laundry in front of other people,' and then when he finally made his decision after his wife, Edie, darling, wonderful Edie died, he said, 'I can't do this anymore.' And he got up and said, 'My name is Desi and I'm an alcoholic.' And that's my proudest moment, that he stood up next to me and I watched him do that, to take responsibility and to try to solve it.\"",
      "Less than a year later, Arnaz was diagnosed with lung cancer. \"My mother came down to visit my dad in Del Mar when he was sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I ran and got as many VHS tapes as I could find, and they did sit there for a couple hours and look at old 'I Love Lucy' shows and laugh and remember.\"",
      "On November 30, 1986, what would've been their wedding anniversary, Desi and Lucy spoke for a final time.",
      "\"He was very, very sick,\" said Lucie. \"And I said, 'I'm gonna put him on the phone now, so say what you wanna say.' And I just held the phone to his ear. And all I could hear her saying was, 'I love you,' like, five times in a row. And he listened and he said, 'I love you too, honey.' And then he said, 'Good luck with your shows.'\"",
      "Two days later, Desi Arnaz died at 69.",
      "We end with the man himself, during a 1954 tribute hosted by Ed Sullivan, reflecting on his extraordinary journey: \"We came to this country and we didn't have a cent in our pockets. From cleaning canary cages to this night here in New York, it's a long ways. And I don't think there's any other country in the world that would give you that opportunity. I want to say, 'Thank you, thank you, America.'\"",

    "summary": "Since his death in 1981 at age 38, the singer-songwriter's legacy has only grown beyond such emotional songs as \"Cat's in the Cradle\" and \"Taxi,\" to include charities he founded to address food insecurity, while living life with a simple credo: \"When in doubt, do something.\"",
    "story": [
      "Harry Chapin's #1 hit \"Cat's In the Cradle,\" from 1974, may be one of the most powerful songs ever written about fatherhood. It tells the tale of a very busy dad:",
      "My son turned ten just the other day He said, \"Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on, let's play Can you teach me to throw?\" I said, \"Not today, I got a lot to do.\" he said, \"That's OK.\" And he walked away, but his smile never dimmed, Said, \"I'm gonna be like him, yeah. You know, I'm gonna be like him\"",
      "And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon. \"When you coming home, Dad?\" \"I don't know when, We'll get together then.You know we'll have a good time then\"",
      "To hear Harry Chapin perform \"Cat's in the Cradle,\" click on the video embed below:",
      "So, how did Chapin's own children feel about that song?",
      "Jen Chapin said, \"The one time when I get a little eeehhh is when somebody tells me, like, 'Oh, your dad, he played a three-and-a-half-hour concert, and then he signed every single poetry book, and he kissed my girlfriend, and \u2026' And I'm like, 'That's great, but that was time we didn't have.'\"",
      "Jen and her brothers, Jason and Josh, want to be clear: Harry Chapin was not the dad in the song. \"He really loved kids,\" Jen said. \"When he came home, he wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm just gonna, like, zone out.' He was, 'Yes! Projects! Trips! Family outings!'\"",
      "\"Cat's In the Cradle\" was originally a poem written by Harry's wife, Sandy, now 90, but it wasn't about him. \"It was based on the relationship her first husband had with his father,\" said Jason. \"My mother was always observing how they didn't connect on a father-son basis.\"",
      "Harry Chapin came from a musical family. He and two of his brothers formed a band. \"We became the Chapin Brothers,\" said Harry's younger brother, Tom Chapin. \"And we played together for ten years. And it was the only time we were ever cool!\"",
      "Tom has his own successful performing career, but Harry was always the driven one. \"When I was a kid, I came up with this line that the family loved: 'Two's company, Harry's a crowd!'\" he laughed. Harry, he said, was outgoing, \"and unafraid. He had this energy that was astonishing.\"",
      "But as his son Jason recalls, Harry's path to success was never a sure thing: \"He was depressed a lot during college. He had failed in many things, and I think that he was really desperate to be successful at something.\"",
      "His first love was documentaries. In fact, he directed one, \"Legendary Champions,\" that got an Oscar nomination. But music won out. In 1972, while he was performing as the warmup act for his brothers' band, Elektra Records signed him up. He was 30 years old.",
      "Tom Chapin says he was surprised that Harry was plucked, \"but not shocked, let's put it that way. He was great. We were good. But he was great.\"",
      "His first hit was \"Taxi,\" another story of broken dreams:",
      "And she said we must get together,But I knew it'd never be arranged.And she handed me twenty dollars,For a two-fifty fare, she said,\"Harry, keep the change.\" \u2026",
      "And she walked away in silence,  It's strange, how you never know,  But we'd both gotten what we'd asked for,  Such a long, long time ago.",
      "Harry Chapin performs \"Taxi\":",
      "According to son Josh, his mother Sandy encouraged his dad to do something with his celebrity: \"She asked, 'Do you wanna be on the cover of the Hit Parade or Time magazine?' And he thought about it, and he said, 'You know what? There really is an emptiness to just chasing celebrity and trying to become a bigger rock star.'\"",
      "Harry decided he'd do something about hunger.\u00a0 He began devoting his time, money and fame to charities that addressed food insecurity. He helped convince Jimmy Carter to start a presidential commission on world hunger.",
      "\"I would hate to be 75 years old, and say, 'If only I had\u2026,' 'I wish I had\u2026,' 'I wonder what my life meant\u2026,'\" Chapin once said. \"My credo is, when in doubt, do something.\"",
      "And he became the king of the benefit concert. \"I do about 220 concerts a year, about a hundred of which are benefits,\" Chapin said in 1980. \"In the long run, we're not sure about a prior-life or an after-life. We're all hoping for that. But what we can do is maximize what we have in this brief flicker of time in the infinity, and try to milk that.\"",
      "Time for Harry Chapin was short. On July 16, 1981, he died in car crash. He was 38. \"The world shook,\" Tom Chapin said. \"The universe shook, when Harry's suddenly not there.\"",
      "Memorials were held, tribute concerts performed, foundations founded. But Chapin's most lasting legacies are the charities he built. In 1975 he'd cofounded WhyHunger, with a priest and radio DJ named Bill Ayres. Today, it partners with organizations in 25 countries \u2013 helping to establish a sustainable farming school in Colombia; fostering traditional farming practices in Panama; and supporting programs in the U.S., like an urban farm and co-op in Detroit.",
      "In 1980, Chapin started Long Island Cares, a food bank. \"Everyone thinks of Long Island as a rich bastion of the country; it's not,\" said the food bank's CEO, Paule Pachter. \"There are pockets of affluence here, but most Long Islanders are living paycheck-to-paycheck.\"",
      "On an annual basis, Long Island Cares distributes 16 million pounds of food. \"That's roughly 14.5 million meals,\" Pachter said.",
      "Chapin's biggest hits were his story songs. Most people think of them as tragic tales, especially \"Cat's in the Cradle\":",
      "I've long since retired and my son's moved away. I called him up just the other day. I said, \"I'd like to see you if you don't mind.\" He said, \"I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time. You see, my new job's a hassle, and the kid's got the flu, But it's sure nice talking to you, Dad. It's been sure nice talking to you.\" And as I hung up the phone, it occurred to me, He'd grown up just like me. My boy was just like me.",
      "In the song's ironic twist ending, the grown son becomes too busy for his dad. But Jason Chapin points out that there's another way to look at that turn: \"Some people interpret the last verse, when the dad calls the son to say, 'Let's get together,' the son is too busy for his dad, because he's busy with his own family, being a good dad. It needs a little close reading sometimes.\"",
      "The surviving Chapins still feel the pain of a life cut short, but they're still active in his charities, and remain inspired by Harry's message.",
      "Tom Chapin recalled, \"James, the oldest brother, said it at the funeral: 'We lost Harry. Those are big shoes to fill. But we can't fill 'em. You can't be Harry. You don't wanna be Harry. Just fill your own shoes a little fuller.'",
      "\"And when in doubt, do something!\" Tom added. \"Don't forget that!\"",

    "story": [
      "For half a century, Beach Boys songs like \"Fun, Fun, Fun\"  have promised unending summers of fun in the sun -- not at all like the life founding Beach Boy Brian Wilson actually led for many years, as Anthony Mason tells us now in our Sunday Profile:",
      "On a warm summer night at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles last month, Brian Wilson -- backed by a band that included fellow former Beach Boy Al Jardine -- was running through his repertoire of classics when a cake was wheeled out from backstage by the extended Wilson family.",
      "On this night, the man many regard as one of America's greatest living songwriters turned 73.",
      "Well, East coast girls are hip, \tI really dig those styles they wear. \tAnd the Southern girls, with the way they talk, \tThey knock me out when I'm down there. \tThe Midwest farmer's daughters really make you feel alright. \tAnd the Northern girls with the way they kiss \tThey keep their boyfriends warm at night.",
      "I wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California \tI wish they all could be California girls.",
      "-- \"California Girls,\" by Brian Wilson and Mike Love (1965)",
      "Wilson, who created the sun & surf sound that's still the soundtrack for the American summer, has had a summer of milestones. On tour again, he has just released his 11th solo album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" and is the subject of a new film about his life, \"Love & Mercy.\"",
      "Mason asked, \"How did you feel when you saw the film?\"",
      "\"I was very happy to see the good parts,\" Wilson said. \"But the dark periods were, like, very rough to watch.\"",
      "John Cusack plays an older Brian Wilson, the artist struggling to recover from depression, mental illness and drug abuse. Paul Dano pays the younger Brian Wilson, the musical genius who dreams up the Beach Boys' intricate harmonies and orchestrations.",
      "Wilson was just 20 when the Beach Boys signed with Capitol Records and made their first album in an L.A. studio.",
      "Mason asked, \"Do you remember recording in this room?\"",
      "\"I remember recording 'If everybody had an ocean across the USA ...'\" Wilson said.",
      "He would create the most successful band in America, blending the voices of his brothers Dennis and Carl, cousin Mike Love, and close friend Al Jardine. \"Mike on bass, Al and Dennis and Carl in the mid-range, and me on falsetto. We all sang together. And the harmony just happened.\"",
      "\"Love & Mercy\" focuses on two pivotal points in Wilson's life: First, the recording of The Beach Boys' highly-influential \"Pet Sounds\" album in 1965, that featured \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" and \"God Only Knows.\"",
      "\"I was so proud of that album, I could have cried,\" said Wilson. \"Very proud of it.\"",
      "\"Your father fought you about it, and the band fought you about it,\" said Mason.",
      "\"Well, they didn't like it. Mike and the guys didn't like it. They, you know, thought it was too advanced music. They wanted to keep making car songs and surf songs. I said, 'Guys, we gotta grow. We've gotta grow musically.'\"",
      "The film's other focus is the 1980s, and Wilson's troubled relationship with Dr. Eugene Landy, the psychologist accused of making him a virtual prisoner.",
      "It took nearly two decades for the film to be made. And when Brian's wife, Melinda, first saw it, she said, \"I got up and I bolted. I drove around the city for two hours, And it was tough. It was tough to watch.\"",
      "\"What were you doing while you were driving around the city?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Just thinking. 'Oh my God, did we do the right thing? It's been 19 years and this is how it's ending.'\"",
      "\"And how did you make peace with it?\"",
      "\"It was the truth,\" she said. \"So that's how I made peace with it. When you tell the truth, everything works out.\"",
      "The film tells the story of how Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) first met the troubled musician in 1986.",
      "\"I went to a Cadillac dealership to buy a car,\" recalled Wilson. \"And she was working there, and when I saw her I liked her the first time I saw her. And she sold me a car!\"",
      "Wilson gave Melinda a card that read, \"Frightened, scared, lonely.\"",
      "\"Did you look at that card right away?\" Mason asked.",
      "\"Oh yeah, I was just like, What is he trying to tell me?  I knew I liked him. I knew I liked him a lot. And then when he left the card I was just like, what's going on here?\"",
      "Brian was then under the 24-hour care of Dr. Landy (Paul Giamatti in the film), who was controlling every aspect of his life, even co-writing songs, co-producing his records, and screening who could see him.",
      "Mason asked Wilson, \"When you think of that period of your life, what do you think of?\"",
      "\"Unhappiness,\" he said. \"Being tortured.  All that stuff.\"",
      "\"Is it something you try not to think of?\"",
      "\"Yeah.  Yeah.\"",
      "About six months into their relationship, Melinda decided she had to act: \"I called the Attorney General and he said there was nothing that could be done unless his family got involved. So a lot of times with Landy I had to be play-acting because I knew he was a bad guy.\"",
      "\"That's got to be an extremely difficult position to be in,\" said Mason.",
      "\"It was like I said to my mother:  'You know, I feel like a child is being abused.' And I couldn't find anybody that wanted to help. As much as I hate to say it, I think the family just -- they were at their rope's end with Brian and they didn't really know what to do.\"",
      "Landy eventually cut Melinda off from Brian.",
      "\"I saw her for three years. And then Dr. Landy severed the relationship,\" said Wilson.",
      "And how did he respond to that? \"Negatively,\" he said. \"I said, 'Tat's not fair, Gene. That's not fair.'\"",
      "Melinda recalled Brian telling her, \"I want outta this hellhole.\" And that, she told Mason, gave her all the impetus she needed.",
      "Landy's grip on Wilson was finally broken in 1991, when the family discovered that Brian's will had been revised -- with Landy named as his main beneficiary.",
      "They eventually won a court order barring the therapist from any further contact with his patient. Brian Wilson's nine-year ordeal was over.",
      "Brian and Melinda were married in 1995. They have five adopted children together.",
      "The song \"One Kind of Love,\" on Brian Wilson's new album, \"No Pier Pressure,\" is dedicated to Melinda.  (To hear Wilson perform the song click on the video player below.)",
      "Just driftwood floating on the sea, \tSearching for the me and all that I have known to be. \tThank God that you noticed me, \tAnd brought back harmony to this lonely soul.",
      "Mason asked, \"How important was Melinda in you getting through that?\"",
      "\"Well, she got me bailed out of it,\" Wilson said. \"She got me out of the program. She was my hero.\"",
      "\"He is really strong -- people don't get that about him,\" Melinda said. \"They think he's passive and just sits around. But he's strong.\"",
      "\"Was there a moment when you knew you'd actually won?\"",

Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",

      "The agency's new guidance says that tracking measles immunity status is important to help health departments quickly identify people who need to be vaccinated or offered antibody injections in the case of an outbreak within a camp.",
      "\"Decide if you will allow unvaccinated campers and staff at your camp. Understand the risk if you do accept a camper or staff member who has not been immunized for measles,\" the American Camp Association says in its guidance for camps, which shared the CDC's checklist.",
      "Other steps that the CDC recommends summer camps take to prepare for measles spread this year include stocking up on face masks and preparing a potential isolation space to separate campers who are sickened.",
      "The CDC's new recommendations come as confirmed measles cases have climbed to 1,197 infections so far in 2025, less than 100 cases away from topping the record 1,274 cases that were confirmed for all of 2019. That marked a record since the U.S. in 2000 declared uncontrolled community spread of the virus\u00a0eliminated\u00a0through widespread measles vaccinations.",
      "At the time in 2019, health officials said the total number of cases added up to the worst tally on record since the 20th century.",
      "This year's wave is already deadlier than the 2019 wave of outbreaks, which health officials and experts suspect is due to missed infections that have gone unreported.",
      "In 2019, summer camps in New York tightened their vaccination requirements amid record outbreaks in the state among underimmunized communities. In response to the outbreaks, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed a law\u00a0that year removing religious exemptions from measles vaccination requirements for school and child day care programs.",
      "About two in three confirmed measles cases this year have been in children or teens, according to the CDC's tally. Most have been linked to local outbreaks within the U.S., many from the outbreak in Texas and neighboring states earlier this year.",
      "While new cases around Texas slowed in April, preliminary CDC data from recently reported measles cases \u2014 backdated to when patients' symptoms began \u2014 suggests the pace of new infections nationwide began accelerating again in May.",
      "The agency also recently stepped up its warning about the risk of catching measles while traveling. The new guidance followed dozens of cases of travelers infectious while flying on airplanes within the U.S., and a suspected case of spread during air travel, CBS News previously reported.",

    "published": "Thu, 12 Jun 2025 19:58:27 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the previous roster of the CDC's vaccine advisers on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary\u00a0Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced Wednesday he's naming eight new advisers to serve on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations committee, after firing the committee's entire previous roster of 17 advisers.",
      "\"All of these individuals are committed to evidence-based medicine, gold-standard science, and common sense. They have each committed to demanding definitive safety and efficacy data before making any new vaccine recommendations,\" Kennedy said Wednesday in a post on X.",
      "Kennedy's picks circumvented the usual CDC process for selecting members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, known as ACIP. In previous administrations, career agency officials \u2014 not political leaders \u2014 vetted potential experts before forwarding them to the department for the secretary's approval.",
      "The CDC also removed the career officials tasked with overseeing the committee and its agenda, effectively replacing them with an appointee of the Trump administration.",
      "The panel's influential recommendations are closely watched because they are directly tied to federal policies, like which vaccines insurers are required to cover.",
      "The picks announced by Kennedy include some close allies of the secretary and his inner circle. Several have a history of criticizing vaccine recommendations or questioning their safety. Some have ties to lawsuits against vaccine makers. One says he previously invested in a vaccine.",
      "A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said that Kennedy \"has replaced vaccine groupthink with a diversity of viewpoints\" on the panel and said that ethics agreements would be made public for the new members before they begin work for the ACIP.",
      "\"The speed with which these members were selected, and the lack of transparency in the process, does not help to restore public confidence and trust, and contributes to confusion and uncertainty,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, president of the American College of Physicians, said in a statement.",
      "Here is a look at those named:",
      "Dr. Robert Malone",
      "One of the Kennedy allies named to the committee, Dr. Robert Malone, worked on early research related to mRNA vaccine technology but was accused during the COVID-19 pandemic of spreading misinformation about the mRNA vaccines. He was with Kennedy and President Trump at the Trump election night celebration in Florida.",
      "\"On the basis of data from all over the world, approximately three years ago it was my impression that the risk/benefit ratio of these products did not merit continued use in any cohort,\" Malone posted last month on his Substack about the mRNA COVID vaccines.",
      "Like Kennedy, Malone has questioned the benefits of measles vaccines during the recent record outbreak in Texas, which killed two children, and he has promoted unproven treatments for the virus.",
      "Dr. Martin Kulldorff",
      "Another member picked by Kennedy is Dr. Martin Kulldorff, an epidemiologist who co-authored the pandemic-era Great Barrington Declaration criticizing COVID-19 restrictions, along with now-NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya. Bhattacharya has described Kulldorff as a close friend.",
      "Kulldorff previously worked with the CDC's outside vaccine advisers, before authoring an opinion piece in 2021 criticizing the agency's decision to pause use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine over safety concerns.",
      "He\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from working with the committee over the opinion piece. Kulldorff later\u00a0claimed\u00a0he was fired from Harvard University for criticizing COVID-19 vaccine requirements.",
      "He also previously testified as an expert witness in a lawsuit by a law firm tied to Kennedy against Merck's HPV vaccine Gardasil. Kulldorff was being paid $400 an hour, he said in 2024. Reuters previously reported Kulldorff's work for the firm, WisnerBaum.",
      "During Kennedy's confirmation process, Senate Democrats had accused him of a conflict of interest for his ties to WisnerBaum and its litigation against Merck's vaccine, calling on him to amend his ethics agreement to avoid cashing in on any settlements or judgments from the lawsuit.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrics professor who previously served as a member of the Food and Drug Administration's own vaccines panel \u2014 the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee \u2014 was also named to the committee.",
      "Meissner opposed COVID-19 vaccine requirements for children. He also co-authored an opinion piece with now-FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary speaking out against masking of children during the pandemic.",
      "Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who previously worked as the chair of the FDA vaccine panel that Meissner served on, described Meissner as the only person she knew from Kennedy's list with credible experience in pediatric infectious diseases and analyzing the illnesses and deaths prevented by vaccines.",
      "Meissner was previously listed in April as a consultant to the RSV vaccines work group for the CDC committee, before Kennedy fired its advisers.",
      "\"He's a card-carrying infectious disease person who knows the burden of these diseases, and he knows the risk and the benefit. And I think it will be a challenge for him, but obviously, he knows what he's getting into,\" Edwards said.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, Ph.D., R.N.",
      "Vicky Pebsworth, a regional director of the National Association of Catholic Nurses, was also a former member of the FDA vaccines panel.",
      "Pebsworth spoke at a 2020 meeting of the FDA vaccines committee, where she identified herself as the research director for the National Vaccine Information Center and \"mother of a child injured by his 15-month well-baby shots in 1998.\" She said the center's position was that any \"coercion and sanctions to persuade adults to take an experimental vaccine, or give it to their children, is unethical and unlawful.\"",
      "Pediatrician Dr. Vincent Iannelli questioned Pebsworth's objectivity in a post Wednesday on his Vaxopedia website, citing a 2009 blog post where she described her advocacy on the issue.",
      "\"For those of us within the vaccine-injured communities who are fighting on behalf of our children for the basic human right to make voluntary, informed vaccination decisions that are based on sound science rather than ideology, it is a battle. And it is personal,\" Pebsworth wrote.",
      "Retsef Levi, Ph.D.",
      "Kennedy also praised another pick, MIT professor Retsef Levi, saying: \"Dr. Levi has collaborated with public health agencies to evaluate vaccine safety, including co-authoring studies on mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and their association with cardiovascular risks.\"",
      "In an interview Levi shared on social media after the announcement, he said he would \"keep an open mind,\" but also stood by his previous call for mRNA vaccines like Pfizer and Moderna's COVID-19 shots to be suspended.",
      "\"I think it's obvious that these mRNA vaccines should not be given to anybody young or healthy. It is also not at all clear to me that they should be given to anybody, based on the evidence,\" he said.",
      "Levi previously called for more detailed data from the COVID-19 vaccine trials, suggesting that changes to how Pfizer's shot was produced may have caused side effects.",
      "In 2021, Levi spoke at a meeting of the FDA's outside vaccine advisers during its public comment session, opposing a broad authorization of COVID-19 boosters.",
      "An article co-authored by Levi in 2022\u00a0raised \"concerns regarding vaccine-induced undetected severe cardiovascular side-effects\" based on data from Israeli emergency calls.",
      "He\u00a0faced criticism\u00a0this year for a paper co-authored with Florida Surgeon General Dr. Joseph Ladapo, which was cited in the state's move to recommend that young men not get mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. Experts\u00a0condemned\u00a0the paper for misleading methods that could inflate the risk.",
      "Dr. Michael A. Ross",
      "Kennedy said Dr. Michael A. Ross \"contributed to national strategies for cancer prevention and early detection, including those involving HPV immunization,\" working with the CDC's breast and cervical cancer committee.",
      "Ross is described by Kennedy as an obstetrics and gynecology professor at George Washington University and Virginia Commonwealth University, though his name does not appear on directories for either university.",
      "\"Dr. Michael Ross has not held a faculty appointment at the George Washington University since 2017,\" Katelyn Deckelbaum, a spokesperson for the university, told CBS News in an email.",
      "Deckelbaum said that Ross was previously a clinical professor, but stopped teaching medical students or residents at the university.",
      "A spokesperson for Virginia Commonwealth University, Leila Ugincius, said Ross \"was an affiliate faculty member\" through the university's regional campus at Inova, a hospital system in the D.C. area, before a partnership with the hospital ended in 2021.",
      "Ross\u00a0is listed as cosigning an open letter during the COVID-19 pandemic that criticized a study that concluded ivermectin was ineffective for treating the disease. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy\u00a0previously reported Ross had backed the letter.",
      "\"We oppose this fixation on randomized controlled trials at the expense of other clinical and scientific evidence and urge medical policymakers to restore balance to the practice of medicine,\" the letter said.",
      "The investment firm Havencrest Capital Management lists Ross as a partner. The firm said Ross is a pediatrics professor, not an obstetrics and gynecology professor.",
      "Maryland-based Manta Pharma\u00a0had until Thursday listed\u00a0Ross as a medical adviser. On a LinkedIn\u00a0profile\u00a0that had been linked by the company, Ross said he worked for and served on advisory boards for several medical companies, including \"an investment in a vaccine company.\"",
      "HHS, Havencrest Capital Management and Manta Pharma did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Dr. James Pagano",
      "Dr. James Pagano, described by Kennedy as a \"strong advocate for evidence-based medicine,\" has published two fiction titles about hospital medicine.",
      "\"Over the course of his medical career he has worked in a number of emergency departments in the greater L.A. area, including major trauma centers as well as smaller community hospitals. He has been the medical director of one ER or another for many years,\" describes an Amazon listing for one of his books in 2012.",
      "A blog and X account with Pagano's name from several years ago wrote about a range of issues, like\u00a0voicing disappointment over Republicans failing to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, but says little about vaccines.",
      "Records from the Medical Board of California list Pagano as being retired.",
      "Dr. Joseph Hibbeln",
      "Another Kennedy pick, Dr. Joseph Hibbeln, retired from the National Institutes of Health in 2020. His research portfolio previously covered nutritional intake of fatty acids like omega-3. He previously participated in federal panels related to his work, including the federal Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee.",
      "Kennedy described him as bringing \"expertise in immune-related outcomes, psychiatric conditions, and evidence-based public health strategies.\"",
      "Hibbeln previously co-authored a study probing whether exposure during pregnancy to mercury was linked to autism, in the wake of now-debunked research that falsely suggested a mercury-based preservative that was previously used in vaccines was causing autism.",
      "They concluded that there was \"no consistent evidence from this study to implicate prenatal exposure to mercury\" in causing autism, and that \"the benefits of nutrients in fish counteract any possible adverse cognitive and behavioral differences\" caused by mercury exposure.",
      "A 2023 presentation by Hibbeln about seafood intake in pregnancy listed him as a professor at the University of Bristol and a psychiatrist for California-based Mindful Health Solutions.",
      "Kennedy's monthslong search for new members",
      "Kennedy's picks cap a monthslong search that the secretary and his aides have conducted for replacements to the committee.",
      "Former CDC official Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at the USC Keck School of Medicine, said he was among those approached for suggestions early this year. He said none of his suggestions were among Kennedy's picks.",
      "Klausner criticized Kennedy's pick of Malone, calling him a \"a well-known promoter of various conspiracy theories and was advocating for use of ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of COVID.\"",
      "\"Seems like his appointment is not consistent with some of Secretary Kennedy's public commitments,\" Klausner said.",
      "Kennedy told reporters on Monday that he was picking \"highly credentialed\" experts for the panel.",
      "\"We're going to bring people onto the ACIP panel, not anti-vaxxers, who are bringing people on who are credentialed scientists, who are highly credentialed physicians, who are going to do evidence-based medicine,\" he said.",
      "In an \"FAQ\" document shared with stakeholder groups, HHS said the department intended \"to ensure balanced membership in terms of the points of view represented.\"",

    "story": [
      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",

      "Kraft Heinz will remove artificial dyes from its products sold in the U.S. by the end of 2027, the company announced Tuesday. The multinational food company also said it will stop making new products that contain these dyes, effective immediately.",
      "Kraft Heinz, the manufacturer of foods such as Jell-O, Capri Sun and Kool-Aid, said in an online statement that 10% of its products contain the dyes and that it has invested in removing the colors or replacing them with natural colors.",
      "Kraft Heinz replaced artificial dyes in its Kraft Mac & Cheese product in 2016, while some other products, including Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never had dyes, the company said. Kraft Heinz's announcement comes amid a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to root out artificial dyes from the nation's food supply and instead replace them with natural dyes.",
      "\"The vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we've been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C (Food, Drug & Cosmetic) colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" said Pedro Navio, North America president at Kraft Heinz in the company's statement.",

    "summary": "The Federal Reserve Board will announce its next rate decision on Wednesday, June 18 at 2 p.m. EST.",
    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve Bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, maintaining the same cautious posture it has assumed throughout the first half of 2025.",
      "That's according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which as of June 18, 2025, shows a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. CME Group is the parent company of the Chicago Board of Trade and other exchanges.",
      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Friday cleared way for Nippon Steel purchase of U.S. Steel, including unusual control for the president.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's\u00a0executive order\u00a0on Friday clearing the way for Japan-based Nippon Steel to potentially buy U.S. Steel comes with an unusual corporate twist called a \"golden share.\"",
      "As part of the agreement, Mr. Trump will gain power to approve a number of major corporate decisions for the company, signaling that the president could potentially block the company from relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters from Pittsburgh, or transferring or relocating jobs outside the U.S.",
      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

    "summary": "The bill has bipartisan support but was stalled for weeks amid Democratic pushback and contentious amendments.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is moving toward final passage on a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",
      "Two Republicans have also consistently voted against the legislation \u2014 Republican Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Josh Hawley of Missouri \u2014 albeit for different reasons. Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",
      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively. Doing nothing and protecting the status quo is not only irresponsible, it's unacceptable,\" she said on the Senate floor last week.",
      "Gillibrand acknowledged that Mr. Trump's involvement in the crypto sphere is \"extremely unhelpful\" but argued it \"does not diminish the excellent work in this legislation.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",
      "\"Will they be intimidated to advertise that?\" he pointed out.",
      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",
      "\"It threatens to be a real distortion of the economy around the Trump brand,\" he said. \"My message to hard-working Americans is to slam down the phone in the face of this marketing ploy.\"",
      "What does Trump Mobile phone plan include?",
      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",
      "\"It's going to be cheaper, 47 bucks a month. You're going to have more internet. More international dialing for free, hundreds of countries. International dialing for free. It is the biggest bang for the buck,\" he added.",
      "The plan will include free calls to more than 100 countries, including those with U.S. military bases. People with the plan will also have access to 24/7 roadside assistance through Drive America, as well as telehealth services, the company said.",
      "The Trump Organization added that it will debut a\u00a0T1 Phone\u00a0with a price tag of $499, requiring a down payment of $100. An image of the phone depicts a gold-colored device emblazoned with the phrase, \"Make America Great Again.\"",
      "The Trump Organization website says the T1 Phone will be available in August, although the Trump Mobile website states the phone will debut in September.",
      "The device, which will have a fingerprint sensor and the ability to unlock using face recognition, will include 256 gigabytes of internal storage and 12gb of RAM. It uses the Android operating system.",
      "It's unclear what company will manufacture the devices, with the Trump Mobile website noting that its products and services \"are not designed, developed, manufactured, distributed or sold by The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\" The website adds that the T1 Phone LLC is using the \"Trump\" name as part of a limited license agreement.",
      "\"I think we're going to really shake up the space in a very big way, both in terms of the actual hardware of the films and then obviously e-sim cards, and then just what you get for a plan per month,\" Eric Trump added.",

      "\"The Flight Data Recorder (FDR) and Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) have been located and secured,\" an official from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said in a statement late on Sunday.",
      "The hope is that the voice recorder will help investigators piece together what caused the plane to crash just minutes after it took off from Ahmedabad Airport. The cockpit voice recorder captures audio from the cockpit, including conversations between pilots, alarms and ambient sounds.",
      "A mayday call was sent by the flight captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, seconds after the London-bound plane left the runway in Ahmedabad.",
      "Rescue workers and investigators recovered the other black box, the flight data recorder, on Friday. That recorder logs reams of data from the various systems on modern passenger jets, everything from altitude and speed to engine performance. Black boxes are designed to survive crashes and are considered vital to air accident investigators in determining the cause of disasters.",
      "India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is leading the probe into the Thursday crash of flight 171. They are being assisted by teams from the U.S. and the U.K. A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board surveyed the crash site in Ahmedabad on Sunday. The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that representatives from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration had also surveyed the crash site.",
      "\"The AAIB has launched a detailed investigation, and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is conducting a parallel probe under international protocols since the aircraft is American-made,\" Prime Minister Modi's office said in a statement on Sunday.",

      "As the investigations into one of the worst accidents in India's aviation history continued, the families of hundreds of victims were still waiting to have their loved ones' remains returned to them.",
      "The plane went up in a massive ball of flames and much of the fuselage was reduced to rubble, making it difficult for authorities to retrieve and identify bodies. Officials have been working to match DNA samples from crash victims' remains and family members since late last week.",

    "story": [
      "Le Bourget, France\u00a0\u2014 Geopolitical tensions roiled the opening of the Paris Air Show on Monday as French authorities sealed off Israeli weapons industry booths amid the conflicts in Iran and Gaza, a move that Israel condemned as \"outrageous.\"",
      "The decision added drama to the major aerospace industry event, which was already under the shadow of last week's deadly crash of Air India's Boeing 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",
      "The booths displayed \"offensive weapons\" that could be used in Gaza - in violation of agreements with Israeli authorities, a French government source told AFP.",
      "The companies - Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), Rafael, Uvision, Elbit and Aeronautics - make drones and guided bombs and missiles.",
      "An Israeli exhibitor wrote a message in yellow chalk on one of the walls, saying the hidden defense systems \"are protecting the state of Israel these days. The French government, in the name of discrimination is trying to hide them from you!\"",
      "French official says Israeli \"offensive weapons\" barred amid war in Gaza",
      "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision during a Monday press conference at the air show.",
      "\"The French government's position was very simple: no offensive weapons at the arms exposition,\" he said. \"Defensive weapons were perfectly acceptable.\"",
      "Bayrou cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza as the rationale behind the ban.",
      "\"Given France's diplomatic choices, in particular the concern, or in any case, very great worries about Gaza, we could not not show that there was a certain distance, which meant that we did not think it acceptable that offensive weapons were in a show like that,\" said Bayrou. \"And as these offensive weapons were not withdrawn [by the Israeli companies], we have temporarily, I hope, closed the stands.\"",
      "At the last Paris Air Show in 2023, Israeli companies - including at least one that was subject to the closure of its stall on Monday - appear to have displayed offensive weapons, including laser-guided bombs and rockets and attack drones.",
      "Aviation news outlet Flight Global reported from the show on Monday that, despite Bayrou's description of a ban on displays of offensive weapons, \"manufacturers from other countries are freely displaying a range of combat aircraft and munitions,\" which it included a display by the French-owned company Dassault Aviation featuring a \"French air force Rafale fighter surrounded by a range of strike munitions.\"",
      "Israel calls France's decision to close stalls \"outrageous and unprecedented\"",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog said he was shocked by the \"outrageous\" closure of the pavilions and said the situation should be \"immediately corrected.\"",
      "\"Israeli companies have signed contracts with the organizers... it's like creating an Israeli ghetto,\" he said on French television channel LCI.",
      "The Israeli defense ministry said in a statement that the \"outrageous and unprecedented decision reeks of policy-driven and commercial considerations.\"",
      "\"The French are hiding behind supposedly political considerations to exclude Israeli offensive weapons from an international exhibition - weapons that compete with French industries,\" it said. \"This is particularly striking given Israeli technologies' impressive and precise performance in Iran.\"",
      "Israel launched surprise strikes on Iranian military and nuclear sites early on Friday, killing top commanders and scientists, prompting Tehran to hit back with a barrage of missiles.",
      "Arkansas' Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders was at the Paris show on Monday and, speaking with reporters, she called the French officials' decision \"pretty absurd.\" Her father is Mike Huckabee, the current U.S. Ambassador to Israel and a staunch backer of the ongoing Israeli operations in Gaza.",
      "The presence of Israeli firms at Le Bourget, though smaller than in the past, was already a source of tension before the start of the Paris Air Show, because of the conflict in Gaza.",
      "A French court last week rejected a bid by NGOs to ban Israeli companies from Le Bourget over concerns about \"international crimes.\"",
      "Local lawmakers from the Seine-Saint-Denis department hosting the event were absent during Bayrou's visit to the opening of the air show in protest over the Israeli presence.",
      "\"Never has the world been so disrupted and destabilized,\" Bayrou said earlier at a roundtable event, urging nations to tackle challenges \"together, not against each other.\"",
      "Boeing focuses on support, not sales at Paris Air show after Air India crash",
      "The row over Israel cast a shadow over a trade fair that is usually dominated by displays of the aerospace industry's latest flying wonders, and big orders for plane makers Airbus and Boeing.",
      "Airbus announced an order of 30 single-aisle A320neo jets and 10 A350F freighters by Saudi aircraft leasing firm AviLease. The European manufacturer also said Riyadh Air was buying 25 long-range, wide-body A350-1000 jets.",
      "Boeing chief executive Kelly Ortberg last week cancelled plans to attend the biennial event, to focus on the investigation of the Air India crash.",
      "\"Our focus is on supporting our customers, rather than announcing orders at this air show,\" a Boeing spokeswoman told AFP on Monday.",

A new subscription model on the tab will allow channel admins to offer users exclusive content for a monthly fee.",

      "WhatsApp is also planning on integrating ads into the \"Updates\" tab which will allow users to message brands directly if they see a product or service they want, or have a customer service question.

      "\"People really want to chat to businesses on their own terms, and they want to do it in a place where they already spend their time, which is on WhatsApp,\" said Srinivasan.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

    "summary": "Utilities are racing to build data centers to meet surging demand for AI and other tech services. Ratepayers will pick up the tab, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "New Jersey residents got some bad news earlier this year when the state's public utilities board warned that their electricity bills could surge up to 20% starting on June 1. A key driver in that rate hike: data centers.",
      "The spread of these large-scale computing facilities across the U.S. amid growing demand for artificial intelligence, data storage and other technology services is projected to increase electricity consumption to record highs in the coming years, according to experts.",
      "A report from Schneider Electric, a company that specializes in digital automation and energy management, projects that electricity demand will increase 16% by 2029, mainly due to the proliferation of data centers. Most data centers rely on the nation's electrical grid for energy, meaning it will be Americans ratepayers who pick up the tab, Mark Wolfe, executive director of the\u00a0National Energy Assistance Directors Association, a group that represents states on energy issues.",
      "\"As utilities race to meet skyrocketing demand from AI and cloud computing, they're building new infrastructure and raising rates, often without transparency or public input,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email. \"That means higher electricity bills for everyday households, while tech companies benefit from sweetheart deals behind closed doors.\"",
      "More data centers, more power",
      "Thousands of data centers now dot the country, with the\u00a0largest concentrations\u00a0in Virginia, California and Texas. The number of data centers in the U.S. nearly doubled between 2021 and 2024, according to a report from Environment America, a network of environmental groups.",
      "It's not just the number of data centers that are expected to rise, but the size. \"The trend has been bigger data centers,\" Dave Turk, the\u00a0former deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy, told CBS MoneyWatch.\u00a0\"They tend to be more energy efficient.\"",
      "Spurring that expansion is the rapid growth of \"generative\" AI companies that are consuming vast amounts of electricity to train so-called Large Language Models like ChatGPT and power. AI searches use 10 times more electricity than normal internet searches, according to a\u00a0study from the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization.",
      "\"AI is an increasing part of data centers and certainly responsible for increased electricity demand,\" Turk said.",
      "Data centers, which contain thousands of computer servers, networking gear and other infrastructure, also require power to cool their systems and keep them from overheating.",
      "Torsten Sl\u00f8k, chief economist at asset management firm Apollo Global Management, estimates that data centers will require an additional 18 gigawatts of power capacity by 2030. To put that into context, New York City power demand is about 6 gigawatts.",
      "About 4.4% of U.S. electricity went to power data centers in 2023, according to a Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory study. Not all of that demand is related to AI, but it represents a portion, Turk said.",
      "Other factors pushing up prices",
      "The spread of data centers isn't the only reason U.S. electricity prices are surging. The price of natural gas, inflation, ongoing electrification of buildings and vehicles, and other factors also play an important role. But utilities are factoring the high demand from data centers into their pricing models.",
      "For example, when Dominion Energy, one of the Virginia's largest utilities, in April\u00a0proposed\u00a0a price hike of $8.51 per month in 2026, the company also floated the idea of a \"new rate class for high energy users, including data centers.\"",
      "Electricity prices have risen 4.5% in the last year, according to recent\u00a0data\u00a0from the Labor Department, and are estimated to\u00a0surge this summer. Energy costs also drift higher if a Republican-backed budget package, dubbed the \"big beautiful bill,\" is passed and signed into law by President Trump. Analysts from Rhodium Group\u00a0predict\u00a0that the bill, which would repeal a slate of tax credits created under the Inflation Reduction Act, could increase a family's energy expenditures by nearly $400 a year.",
      "Beyond price increases, the heightened energy demand from data centers could also compromise the reliability of the grid, according to experts. In a recent\u00a0report, the North American Electric Reliability Corp said that facilities that service AI and cryptocurrency companies are being developed at a faster pace than the power plants and transmission lines to support them, \"resulting in lower system stability.",
      "PJM, a grid operator in 13 states plus Washington, D.C., cited data center demand as one of the factors that could lead to capacity shortages in its 2025 forecast.",

      "Stocks closed lower on Friday and oil prices climbed after a military strike by Israel on Iran stirred investor fears about the risk of war breaking out in the Middle East.",
      "The S&P 500 slid 68 points, or 1.1%, to end the day at 5,977, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 770 points, or 1.8%, to 42,198 points. The Nasdaq Composite shed 1.3%.",
      "The market slide comes after\u00a0Israel launched strikes\u00a0on Iran's nuclear sites and other targets early Friday, the start of what Israel said could be a days-long attack. Iran responded by launching over 100 drones, which Israel claimed it was able to mostly intercept.",
      "The strikes come as President Trump seeks to rein in Iran's nuclear capabilities. The U.S. and Iran are scheduled to meet Sunday in Oman, as part of a series on ongoing talks.",
      "\"The initial market response has been largely contained, but the risk of a broader military conflict certainly cannot be dismissed,\" said Jeff Buchbinder, chief equity strategist at LPL Financial. \"Iran has begun to retaliate and will continue to do so. This phase of the conflict will likely last several weeks at least.\"",
      "The oil market had an even stronger reaction on Friday, with U.S. benchmark crude oil increasing 7.3% to $72.98. Bent crude, the international standard, climbed 7% to $74.23 for a barrel. A deepening conflict could impact the flow of oil from Iran, a major producer of crude, according to analysts.",

      "President Trump on Friday cleared the way for Japan-based Nippon Steel to potentially acquire U.S. Steel, though details about the structure of the deal \u2014 including a possible \"golden share\" held by the federal government \u2014 remain unclear.",
      "The president signed an executive order that says Nippon can buy the iconic Pittsburgh-based steelmaker as long as both parties sign a \"national security agreement.\"",
      "The two companies announced in a joint statement\u00a0Friday that they agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement, which they said mandates $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "Nippon and U.S. Steel said they expect the deal \u2014 referred to as a partnership \u2014 to be \"finalized promptly.\" They thanked Mr. Trump, saying they \"look forward to putting our commitments into action to make American steelmaking and manufacturing great again.\"",
      "Some details about the Nippon-U.S. Steel partnership are not clear. Mr. Trump said earlier this week\u00a0that the government's golden share would give the United States \"51% ownership\" and \"total control\" over U.S. Steel, but Japanese news outlet Nikkei Asia quoted an unnamed Nippon executive who said the company needs \"management freedom\" over the combined company.",
      "Mr. Trump announced he would allow a \"partnership\" between Nippon and U.S. Steel last month.",
      "The deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel has faced tumult and uncertainty since a nearly $15 billion merger was first proposed in late 2023. Former President Joe Biden rejected the deal on national security grounds in the waning weeks of his time in office, but Mr. Trump ordered a new review of the deal and suggested Nippon could agree to \"invest heavily\" in U.S. Steel's facilities rather than fully acquiring the company.",
      "U.S. Steel has said the Nippon deal will allow for new investments in the company's aging facilities, including its Mon Valley Works in the Pittsburgh area. If the deal isn't approved, U.S. Steel has warned it may need to move its headquarters away from Pittsburgh and focus on cheaper ways of making steel than Mon Valley's blast furnaces, putting scores of jobs into jeopardy.",
      "But the United Steelworkers union is staunchly opposed to the deal, calling Nippon's promises to invest in steel mills \"public relations\" and accusing the company of job-costing unfair trade practices.",
      "Rival steelmaker Cleveland Cliffs \u2014 whose offer to buy U.S. Steel was rejected \u2014 has also blasted the deal, accusing Nippon of dumping cheap steel in American markets and saying U.S. Steel \"rejected an all-American solution and insisted on pursuing a doomed-to-fail cash out sale.\" In a lawsuit against the government in the waning days of the Biden administration, Nippon and U.S. Steel accused Cleveland Cliffs and the steel union of undermining their planned merger.",

      "Rare earth minerals, which are a set of 17 metallic elements, are integral to automobile production, and enable features like windshield wipers, seat belts and speakers to function. About 90% of the U.S.'s rare earth minerals come from China, the world's largest producer of rare earths, according to\u00a0data\u00a0from the Geological Survey.",

The controls require businesses to apply for a license to export rare earths, which U.S. automakers say they have been struggling to secure.",
      "Earlier this week, on June 11, following two days of discussions in London, U.S. and Chinese negotiators struck an agreement under which Beijing would resume regular exports of rare earths to the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "Miami\u00a0\u2014 Josefina Muralles works a part-time overnight shift as a receptionist at a Miami Beach condominium so that during the day she can care for her three kids, her aging mother, and her brother, who is paralyzed.",
      "She helps her mother feed, bathe, and give medicine to her adult brother, Rodrigo Muralles, who has epilepsy and became disabled after contracting COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "\"He lives because we feed him and take care of his personal needs,\" said Josefina Muralles, 41. \"He doesn't say, 'I need this or that.' He has forgotten everything.\"",
      "Though her husband works full time, the arrangement means their household income is just above the federal poverty line \u2014 too high to qualify for Florida's Medicaid program but low enough to make Muralles and her husband eligible for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, also known as Obamacare.",
      "Next year, Muralles said, she and her husband may not be able to afford that health insurance coverage, which has paid for her prescription blood thinners, cholesterol medication, and two surgeries, including one to treat a genetic disorder.",
      "Extra subsidies put in place during the pandemic \u2014 which reduced the premiums Muralles and her husband paid by more than half, to $30 a month \u2014 are in place only through Dec. 31. Without enhanced subsidies, Affordable Care Act insurance premiums would rise by more than 75% on average, with bills for people in some states more than doubling, according to estimates from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Florida and Texas would be hit especially hard, as they have more people enrolled in the marketplace than other states. Some of their congressional districts alone, especially in South Florida, have more people signed up for Obamacare than entire states.",
      "Like many of the more than 24 million Americans enrolled in the insurance marketplace this year, Muralles was unaware that the enhanced subsidies are slated to expire. She said she cannot afford a premium hike because inflation has already eaten into her household's budget.",
      "\"The rent is going up,\" she said. \"The water bill is going up.\"",
      "Low-income enrollees like the Muralles couple would see the biggest percentage increases in premiums if enhanced subsidies expire.",
      "Middle-income enrollees who earn more than four times the federal poverty line would no longer be eligible for subsidies at all. Those middle-income enrollees (who earn at least $62,600 for a single person in 2025) are disproportionately older, self-employed, and living in rural areas.",
      "Julio Fuentes, president of the Florida State Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said many of his organization's members are small business owners who rely on Obamacare for health coverage.",
      "\"It's either this or nothing,\" he said.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated that letting the enhanced subsidies expire would, by 2034, increase the number of people without health insurance by 4.2 million. In tandem with changes to Medicaid in the House of Representatives' reconciliation bill and the Trump administration's proposed rules for the marketplace, including toughening income verification and shortening enrollment periods, it would increase the number of uninsured people by 16 million over that time period.",
      "A study by the Urban Institute, a nonprofit think tank, found that Hispanic and Black people would see greater coverage losses than other groups if the extra subsidies lapse.",
      "Fuentes noted that about 5 million Hispanics are enrolled in the ACA marketplace, and that President Trump won the Hispanic vote in Florida in 2024. He hopes the president and congressional Republicans see extending the enhanced subsidies as a way to hold on to those voters.",
      "\"This is probably a good way, or a good start, to possibly grow that base even more,\" he said.",
      "Enrollment in the marketplace has grown faster since 2020 in the states won by Mr. Trump in 2024. A recent KFF survey found that 45% of Americans who buy their own health insurance identify as or lean Republican, including 3 in 10 who identify as Make America Great Again supporters. Smaller shares identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning independents (35%) or do not lean toward either party (20%).",
      "Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said the rules proposed by the Trump administration, combined with the provisions in the House-passed budget bill, would \"strengthen the ACA marketplace.\" He noted that the CBO projects the legislation would reduce premiums for some plans about 12% on average by 2034 \u2014 but out-of-pocket costs would rise or remain the same for most subsidized ACA consumers.",
      "\"Democrats know Americans broadly support ending waste, fraud, and abuse, as The One, Big, Beautiful Bill does, which is why they are desperately trying to change the conversation,\" Desai said.",
      "But Lauren Aronson, executive director of Keep Americans Covered, a group in Washington, D.C., representing health insurers, hospitals, physicians, and patient advocates, said it is critical to raise awareness about the likely impact of losing the enhanced subsidies, which are also known as advanced premium tax credits. She is encouraged that Democrats have proposed legislation to extend the enhanced tax credits, and that some Republican senators have voiced support.",
      "What worries Aronson most is that the Republican-controlled Congress is more focused on extending tax cuts than enhanced subsidies, she said. The current bill extending the 2017 tax cuts would increase the federal deficit by about $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to the CBO, while making the enhanced subsidies permanent would increase the deficit by $358 billion over roughly the same period.",
      "\"Congress is moving forward on a tax reconciliation package that purports to benefit working families,\" Aronson said. \"But if you don't take care of the tax credits, working families will be left holding the bag.\"",
      "Brian Blase, president of Paragon Health Institute, a conservative health policy think tank, said the enhanced subsidies were supposed to be a temporary measure during the COVID-19 pandemic to help people at risk of losing coverage.",
      "Instead, he said, the enhanced subsidies facilitated fraud because enrollees did not need to verify their income eligibility to receive zero-premium plans if they reported incomes at or near the federal poverty level.",
      "The enhanced subsidies also worsen health inflation, discourage employers from offering health insurance benefits, and crowd out alternative models, such as short-term insurance and Farm Bureau plans, Blase said.",
      "\"Permitting these subsidies to expire would just be going back to Obamacare as it was written,\" Blase said. \"That is a more efficient program than the program that we have now.\"",
      "New rules for the marketplace proposed by the Trump administration in March are already designed to address fraud, said Anna Howard, a policy expert with the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, which advocates for increased health insurance coverage. Howard said extending the enhanced tax credits would help ensure that people who are legitimately eligible for coverage can get it.",
      "\"We don't want to see over 5 million people be kicked off their health insurance coverage out of fears of fraud when the policies being proposed don't necessarily address fraud,\" she said.",
      "Without affordable premiums, many consumers will turn to short-term health plans, health care cost-sharing ministries, and other forms of coverage that do not have the benefits or protections of the health law, she said.",
      "\"These are plans that don't provide coverage for prescription drugs, or they have lifetime and annual limits,\" she said. \"For a cancer patient, those plans don't work.\"",
      "Though the enhanced subsidies do not expire until the end of the year, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association would prefer Congress to act by fall to avoid confusion during open enrollment, said David Merritt, a senior vice president. Insurers are preparing rates to meet state deadlines. By October, consumers will receive 60-day plan renewal notices with their 2026 premiums.",
      "Without enhanced subsidies, Merritt said, competition in the marketplace will wither, leading to fewer coverage options and higher prices, especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid eligibility and where Obamacare enrollment spiked during the past four years, like Florida and Texas. \"Voters and patients are really going to see the impact,\" he said.",
      "Republican and Democratic representatives for some of the Florida congressional districts with the highest numbers of people in the marketplace did not respond to repeated interview requests.",
      "Muralles, of North Miami, Florida, said she wants her representatives to work in the interest of constituents like herself, who need health insurance coverage to care for their families.",
      "\"Now is the time to prove to us that they are with us,\" Muralles said. \"When everybody's healthy, everybody goes to work, everybody can pay taxes, everybody can have a better life.\"",

      "The Air India plane crash on Thursday is putting a renewed spotlight on Boeing, the manufacturer of the 787-8 Dreamliner aircraft that crashed in the western Indian city of Ahmedabad with 242 passengers and crew on board.",
      "Boeing says the 787-8 is the aviation industry's \"best-selling passenger widebody of all time,\" carrying more than 1 billion passengers since it was first delivered to airlines in 2011.",
      "What caused the crash remains unclear, and the 787-8 Dreamliner has generally had a good safety record. U.S. safety officials said they are heading to India to assist in the investigation of the accident. A senior Indian police official told the country's national news agency, ANI, that one\u00a0person survived the crash.",
      "\"The NTSB will be leading a team of U.S. investigators travelling to India to assist the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau with its investigation into the crash of an Air India Boeing 787 in Ahmedabad, India, Thursday,\" the National Transportation Safety Board said in a social media post.",
      "In a statement, the Federal Aviation Administration said the local government leads an investigation when it occurs in that country. \"In the event assistance is requested, the NTSB is the official U.S. representative and the FAA provides technical support. We stand ready to launch a team immediately in coordination with the NTSB,\" the agency said.",
      "Boeing said it is in contact with Air India about the crash and stands \"ready to support them. Our thoughts are with the passengers, crew, first responders and all affected.\"",
      "Shares of Boeing fell $10.32, or 4.8%, to $203.59 in early trading.",
      "First crash of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner",
      "The Air India incident represents the first crash of a 787-8 Dreamliner, although the aircraft has been involved in previous investigations.",
      "The aircraft was designed by Boeing to handle longer nonstop routes, which the company says had opened up 425 new routes around the world since the aircraft was introduced.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration last year ordered inspections of the cockpit seats on the Dreamliners after one of the jets went into a dive when the captain's seat lurched forward without warning and disconnected the plane's autopilot system, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Last year, a whistleblower's allegations prompted the FAA to investigate his claims about assembly defects in the company's 787 Dreamliner.",
      "Sam Salehpour, a Boeing quality engineer, said \"he observed shortcuts taken by Boeing\" during assembly of the Dreamliner, \"resulting in drilling debris left in interfaces and deformation of composite material,\" CBS News reported. He also claimed to have witnessed issues with the 777 assembly process, according to a letter sent by Salehpour's lawyers to the FAA last year.",
      "For now, it is unclear if those reported issues are linked in any way to the Air India crash.",
      "The Dreamliner in the Air India crash",
      "The aircraft involved in the Air India crash was first delivered to the airline in January 2014. It was on its way from the western Indian city of Ahmedabad to London's Gatwick airport when it crashed shortly after its departure.",
      "The plane had logged more than 41,000 hours of flying time, with almost 8,000 takeoffs and landings, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. Air India operates 190 aircraft, with an average age of 8.4 years, Cirium said.",
      "There are more than 1,100 Dreamliners operating across the globe today, with the aircraft having been in operation for an average of 7.5 years, Cirium noted.",
      "Air India said there was a \"sole survivor\" of the crash who was being treated at a hospital.",
      "\"The aircraft crashed shortly after take-off. We regret to inform that, of the 242 aboard, there are 241 confirmed fatalities. The sole survivor is being treated in a hospital,\" the airline\u00a0said\u00a0in a statement Thursday on social media.",
      "Other Boeing safety issues",
      "The incident comes after a string of safety issues for Boeing, which has faced investigations and lawsuits for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people. A January incident in which a door plug fell off a 737 Max 9 jet operated by Alaska Airlines in January of 2024 fueled further concerns.",
      "Boeing posted a 2024 loss of $11.8 billion, bringing its total losses since 2019 to more than $35 billion.",
      "In May, the aircraft manufacturer\u00a0reached a $1.1 billion deal\u00a0with the Department of Justice that allows it to avoid prosecution for the crashes, which occurred in 2018 and 2019.",
      "An April 2025 analysis of commercial jet safety from Boeing shows that the airline industry has improved its overall safety record over the past several decades, although there was an increase in accidents in 2024. According to the report, there were 47 accidents last year across the airline industry, including 12 hull losses, and 187 fatalities.",
      "A hull loss can indicate an airplane is completely destroyed or damaged and not repaired, the report said. It can also indicate an airplane is missing and the wreckage hasn't been found.",

    "story": [
      "Americans often voice frustration\u00a0over the ubiquity of tipping these days, but that hasn't stopped them from giving generously to reward good service.",
      "Consumers spent an estimated $77.6 billion on tips for food purchased at restaurants, bars and other eateries in 2023, according to a new study by LendingTree. The analysis, which draws on the most recent government data available, gives readers a snapshot of how much Americans tip and in which states they tip the most.",
      "Perhaps not surprisingly, LendingTree found that tipping rates tend to be higher in states where people eat out more. LendingTree also looked at which Americans around the country drop the biggest tips.",
      "Where do people tip the most?",
      "New Hampshire residents are the No. 1 tippers in the country, according to the LendingTree study. On average, they leave a gratuity of 16.07% of spending on food away from home \u2014 falling within the standard range of 15% to 20% tips at restaurants. New Hampshire's average tipping rate is four times that of the nation's lowest tipping state, which is Utah at 4.09%.",
      "But that's not to say Utah residents are stingy. As LendingTree points out, average tipping rates hinge on how much people in each state spend on food outside the home \u2014 that includes full-service restaurants as well as fast-food place and even vending machines. In other words, not all food that's consumed outside the home is purchased at establishments where tipping is common.",
      "\"If people in one state tend to dine at full-service restaurants far more often than those in another state, it stands to reason their overall percentage spent on tips would be higher,\" LendingTree Chief Consumer Financial Analyst Matt Schulz wrote in the study.",
      "After New Hampshire, residents of Washington, D.C., are the nation's biggest tippers. People in the U.S. capital on average tip 12.65% when eating out.",

Illinois, on the other hand, saw the biggest increase in money spent on eating out, with dining expenditures climbing 13.5% from 2000 to 2023.",

      "If passed, \"No Tax on Tips\" could offer relief to the 4 million people in the U.S. who work in tipped occupations, about 2.5% of all U.S. workers, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",

      "Egg prices dropped to $4.55 in May, down 11% from $5.12 in April, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price drop for a dozen Grade A large eggs comes as the effects of a years-long, widespread avian flu outbreak recede and demand for eggs eases, as it usually does this time of year.",
      "\"There are two main drivers behind the drop in prices \u2014 abatement in the conversation about bird flu, and some seasonality in uses of eggs. Typically as we move into summer, demand for eggs soften as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors,\" Brett House, an economics professor at Columbia Business School, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"People aren't making heavy breakfasts, so we don't see demand for eggs being as strong as it typically is during the winter months.\"",
      "While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, down from $6.23 a dozen in March, they remain elevated compared with 12 months ago. In May 2024, a dozen eggs cost $2.70.",
      "David Ortega, a food economics professor at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch that containing avian flu explains most of the drop in egg prices.",
      "\"This is primarily due to a reduction in the number of commercial facilities that have been impacted by the bird flu,\" he said. \"A lot of bird flu activity in the beginning of the year led to a significant surge in egg prices, but those impacts have really lessened over the past couple of months.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices began to decrease in March, according to Ortega, and the price drops are now starting to show up at the retail level.",

      "To limit the number of people who can see your transactions, you can switch your privacy settings to \"Friends only\" or \"Private.\" The \"Friends only\" setting makes your payment transactions visible to Venmo friends only. The \"Private\" setting, the most restrictive of the three options, limits payment visibility to the two parties engaged in the transaction. Venmo also allows you to retroactively change your transactions to private mode which would hide your entire payment history, according to a company spokesperson.",
      "If you're paying or requesting money from someone who has different privacy setting than you, Venmo will default to whoever's setting is more restrictive.",

      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",

      "Earlier, the president\u00a0said on his Truth Social platform\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",

      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",

      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",

      "Fifty-five attorneys general around the country have now signed on to a $7.4 billion settlement with drugmaker Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family, over the opioid crisis, officials said.",
      "Fifteen states initially agreed to the settlement in January. Since then, an additional 34 states, five territories and Washington, D.C., joined the settlement, according to details released Monday by attorneys general involved in the case. Oklahoma reached a separate $270 million settlement in 2019.",
      "If the settlement is approved in court, it would end the Sacklers' control of Purdue, maker of the addictive painkiller OxyContin, and block the family from selling opioids in the U.S., officials said.",
      "\"For decades, the Sacklers put profits over people, and played a leading role in fueling the epidemic of opioid addictions and overdoses,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. \"While no amount of money can fully heal the destruction they caused, these funds will save lives and help our communities fight back against the opioid crisis.\"",
      "The money will be paid out over the course of 15 years, but officials said over half of the funds will be distributed during the first few years. The Sacklers will make an initial payment of $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay about $900 million. Then the Sacklers will pay $500 million after a year, an additional $500 million after two years and $400 million more after three years.",
      "Not all states will receive the same amount. California expected to receive as much as $440 million. Colorado estimated it would collect around $75 million. New Jersey estimated it would get up to $124.5 million. New York expected to receive up to $250 million.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Purdue said the settlement funds will be used to \"compensate victims, abate the opioid crisis, and deliver opioid use disorder and overdose rescue medicines that will save American lives.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the extraordinarily hard work of the state attorneys general and our other creditors in getting us to this point,\" the company said.",
      "The deal leaves Purdue in bankruptcy with oversight by a monitor and prevents the company from lobbying or marketing opioids. The states involved in the settlement will appoint a board of trustees to oversee the company and determine its future.",
      "The previous\u00a0Purdue bankruptcy settlement\u00a0was struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last year. In a 5-4 decision, the justices said that Sackler family members could not be shielded from liability for civil claims related to the opioid epidemic. The original settlement would have required the Sacklers and Purdue to pay over $4.5 billion.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is moving toward final passage on a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",
      "In early May, Democrats prevented the legislation from advancing, leading to weeks of bipartisan negotiations that resulted in changes that convinced enough Democrats to come back on board and help propel it through several procedural votes.",
      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",

      "\"To date, Congress' failure to act has left the digital asset space as a wild West, where American consumers are vulnerable to scams and businesses are desperate for the regulatory clarity they need to compete with foreign countries, foreign entities that do business in our markets, effectively.

      "A suspect in custody has been charged with murder following targeted shootings\u00a0that killed one Minnesota lawmaker and injured another. Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings \"politically motivated\" in a news briefing\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were fatally shot at their home in Brooklyn Park, Walz said. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife were wounded at their home in Champlin, a nearby suburb of Minneapolis. Investigators said the shooter was dressed as a police officer, and, according to the FBI, also\u00a0traveled to the residences of two other Minnesota state legislators on the night of the shootings but did not go inside. One of those legislators wasn't at home, and a police officer approached the suspect on the property of another, which prompted him to leave.",
      "The\u00a0suspect\u00a0in the Minnesota shootings, identified as\u00a057-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was taken into custody\u00a0Sunday night following a two-day manhunt. Officials said he was found hiding in the woods near his home in Green Isle, in Sibley County. He is facing first-degree murder charges for the killings of the Hortmans and attempted murder charges for the shootings of the Hoffmans.",
      "Boelter served on a state board with Hoffman for more than six years, records show, and authorities investigating the shootings have now said they're looking into whether the suspect knew Hoffman or Hortman personally.",
      "Here's what officials have said about the targeted attacks.",
      "What happened at the homes of Minnesota lawmakers?",
      "Police first responded to a call of a shooting at Hoffman's home in Champlin at around 2 a.m. local time Saturday, Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said in the briefing. Life-saving measures were provided to Hoffman and his wife and they were taken to an area hospital, where they underwent surgery to treat gunshot wounds, Evans said.",
      "Nine bullets hit Sen. Hoffman and eight struck his wife, Yvette, and they were both \"lucky to be alive,\" Yvette Hoffman told Sen. Amy Klobuchar in a text message on Sunday.",
      "\"Our family is so humbled by the love and outpouring we've received from everyone. John is enduring many surgeries right now and is closer every hour to being out of the woods,\" she wrote, in part. \"We are gutted and devastated by the loss of Melissa and Mark. We have no words. There is never a place for this kind of political hate.\"",
      "After authorities learned of the shooting at the Hoffman property, Brooklyn Park police went proactively to Hortman's home, Police Chief Mark Bruley said. The two homes are about five miles apart.",
      "Two Brooklyn Park police officers who went to Hortman's home saw what appeared to be a police vehicle parked in front of the house with its emergency lights on, and a man dressed as a police officer leaving the house, Bruley said. The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the man, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he did not survive. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask concealing his full head and face.",
      "A search of the man's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in the vehicle \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers referenced the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, all \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Suspect Vance L. Boelter in custody",
      "The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Boelter faces state and federal charges. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office in Minnesota filed charges Saturday for second-degree murder and attempted murder in order to obtain a nationwide search warrant, which were the highest charges the office could file at that time, said Mary Frances Moriarty, the county attorney. However, Moriarty told reporters at a news conference Monday that the office intends to seek first-degree murder charges, which would carry a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole if Boelter is convicted.",
      "Federal authorities have also brought charges against Boelter, including two counts each of stalking, murder and shooting the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Investigators had been searching the Sibley County area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",
      "He was armed at the time, but Boelter was taken into custody without any use of force, Geiger said.",
      "Police said it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "The face of evil. After relentless and determined police work, the killer is now in custody. Thanks to the dedication of...",
      "Earlier Sunday, an emergency alert sent to residents of Sibley County said authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is the home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "Suspect's work history",
      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",
      "In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said there was \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004.",
      "She and her husband, Mark, have two children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, who said they are \"devastated and heartbroken\" in a written statement released Monday night.",
      "\"They were the bright lights at the center of our lives, and we can't believe they are gone,\" the statement said. \"Their love for us was boundless. We miss them so much.\"",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Before Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, is a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter. The Hoffmans' nephew said Yvette Hoffman jumped on their daughter, Hope, to\u00a0shield her\u00a0from the gunfire.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting.\" He said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was due to \"what's going on in the Middle East.\"",
      "Mr. Trump landed at Joint Base Andrews shortly before 5 a.m.\u00a0Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived in Canada on Sunday for the annual G7 summit, and met with the leaders of Canada and the United Kingdom earlier Monday. But Leavitt said on X Monday night that the president would leave early, seeming to refer to the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "\"Much was accomplished, but because of what's going on in the Middle East, President Trump will be leaving tonight after dinner with Heads of State,\" Leavitt wrote.",
      "Asked on Monday why he's leaving the summit, Mr. Trump said, \"I have to be back early for obvious reasons.\"",
      "As Air Force 1 taxied before departing Canada, Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that his early return to the capital wasn't related to any Israel-Iran ceasefire talks. French President Emmanuel Macron had brought up the possibility of a ceasefire earlier, drawing criticism from Mr. Trump.",
      "\"He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio is also heading back to Washington, a State Department spokesperson told CBS News.",
      "The U.S. is not joining Israel's military offensive, U.S. officials told CBS News Monday evening. Despite reports that Mr. Trump asked the National Security Council and Situation Room to be readied upon his return to the White House, Cabinet members in the National Security Council are already on standby 24 hours a day \u2014 including since Israel's strikes on Iran began last week.",
      "A spokesperson for Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office told CBS News the country \"was informed of President Trump's departure through official channels prior to the White House's public announcement.\"",
      "The Middle East situation has been the focus of much of the summit already. During Mr. Trump's meeting with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the president said he had \"spoken to everybody\" regarding Israel and Iran.",
      "\"I've spoken to everybody. Israel is doing very well, as you probably noticed,\" the president said, adding, \"I think a deal will be signed or something will happen, but I think a deal will be signed. I think Iran is foolish not to sign one.\"",
      "After the Wall Street Journal reported\u00a0Monday that Iran had sent messages to intermediaries indicating they want to de-escalate the conflict, Mr. Trump affirmed to reporters during his meeting with the Canadian prime minister that he was aware of the messages.",
      "Asked by reporters what he'd heard from Iran, he replied, \"They'd like to talk. But they should have done that before. I had 60 days and they had 60 days. And on the 61st day, I said, we don't have a deal. They have to make a deal.\" He went on to say, \"It's painful for both parties, but I'd say Iran is not winning this war. And they should talk, and they should talk immediately before it's too late.\"",
      "The president's sudden return to Washington comes as Israel and Iran trade airstrikes and missile attacks in the two foes' most intense fighting in decades.",
      "Israel has carried out multiple rounds of airstrikes since late last week, saying it is targeting Iran's nuclear program, research scientists and top military officials. Iran has retaliated with missile and drone strikes on Israel.",
      "On Monday, Israel struck Iranian state television in the capital of Tehran, and urged hundreds of thousands of residents of central Tehran to evacuate. Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"Everyone should immediately evacuate Tehran!\"",
      "The president and other American officials have said publicly and privately that the U.S. is not involved in Israel's strikes on Iran, though Israel did tell the U.S. about the operation in advance, and the U.S. has helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles. CBS News has previously reported that Mr. Trump rejected a plan\u00a0raised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The Israeli leader was asked Monday in an interview with ABC News if he planned to target Khamenei.",
      "\"Look, we're doing what we need to do,\" he told\u00a0ABC News' Jonathan Karl. Karl, noting that Mr. Trump had rejected the idea, told Netanyahu that the president feared that assassinating Iran's supreme leader would escalate the conflict.",
      "\"It's not going to escalate the conflict,\" Netanyahu contended. \"It's going to end the conflict.\" He blamed Iran for \"bringing us to the brink of nuclear war,\" and said that \"in fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this, this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has urged Iran to sign a deal to limit the scope of its nuclear program, convening multiple rounds of talks that are now on hold. Iran has long denied any plans to build a nuclear weapon, though international watchdogs say it has increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium in recent years.

Tehran said at least 224 people have been killed in the assault since last Friday. At least 24 people in Israel have died in Iranian ballistic missile launches that have managed to make it through Israeli air defenses, Israel's military said.",

      "The department also warned Americans against traveling \"for any reason\" to the West Bank due to \"terrorism and civil unrest\" and to Gaza because of \"terrorism and armed conflict.\" It told those who decide to go to the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip to take certain precautions, including drafting a will and securing food, supplies and medicine for an \"extended or indefinite period\" because of closed border crossings with Israel and Egypt.",

    "summary": "The Senate Finance Committee's portion includes changes to Medicaid funding and tax reform.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Republicans on Monday released details on the most contentious elements of the sweeping legislation to enact President Trump's second-term agenda.",
      "The Senate Finance Committee unveiled its portion of Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" which makes changes to the tax and Medicaid provisions in the version that narrowly passed the House last month.",
      "Senate Republicans are aiming to make key progress this week in their effort to approve the legislation, but some of the key sticking points still appear unresolved, making it less certain they'll get the bill to Mr. Trump's desk by their self-imposed deadline of July 4.",
      "Medicaid and provider taxes",
      "GOP senators have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. The House bill seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes.",
      "Several Republicans have said\u00a0the bill could lose their support if the provider tax were to be frozen or decreased, pointing to the potential negative impact on rural hospitals. Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri expressed alarm over the changes, telling reporters that it's a \"major departure\" from the House bill.",
      "\"This is a whole new system that is going to defund rural hospitals effectively in order to what, pay for solar panels in China?\" Hawley said. \"This needs a lot of work. It's really concerning and I'm really surprised by it.\"",
      "SALT \u2014 the state and local tax deduction",
      "The Senate version proposes permanently extending the $10,000 state and local tax deduction, known as SALT. It's a considerable difference from the House measure, which increases the deduction from $10,000 to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "House Republicans from blue states threatened last month to withhold their support for the bill if the cap were not raised and quickly said Monday they'd vote against the package when it comes back to the House. House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has urged senators to make as few changes to the legislation as possible, noting that he can afford to lose just a few votes with his narrow majority.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, called the $10,000 cap a starting point.",
      "\"We understand that it's a negotiation,\" he told reporters Monday evening. \"Obviously, there had to be some marker in the bill to start with, but we're prepared to have discussions with our colleagues here in the Senate and figure out a landing spot.\"",
      "It was a similar sentiment shared by Sen. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who said the figure was a \"just a placeholder.\"",
      "\"Every single thing that's out there is being negotiated. There's not one thing that's not on the table. We're negotiating everything,\" including SALT, Mullin said.",
      "Debt ceiling increase",
      "Senate Republicans are also calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling \u2014 $1 trillion above the limit set by the House.",
      "Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said Monday night it's \"one of the changes I'm not fond of.\" He added that he opposes the bill and was doubtful that sufficient fixes could be made by July.",
      "Taxes on tips, auto loan interest",
      "The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent.",
      "Meanwhile, the Child Tax Credit would increase to $2,200 under the Senate bill, $300 less than the House-passed hike.",
      "Republican leaders have been pushing to get the legislation to the president's desk by early July. But with a short week this week, Senate Republicans need to move quickly in the coming days to put the legislation on a course for passage in the upper chamber before it returns to the House for sign-off on the changes.",
      "Thune said he plans to bring up the budget agenda for a vote next week, but he has threatened to keep senators in Washington, D.C., over the Fourth of July recess to pass it, since several Republicans have expressed doubt about the upper chamber's ability to finish its work on the bill before the self-imposed deadline.",
      "\"We need to get it done,\" Thune told Fox News on Sunday. \"We will roll into the Fourth of July recess if necessary, in order to get this on the president's desk.\"",
      "Cristina  Corujo, \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion and \n                                                  \n                      Grace  Kazarian\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Sunday night directed federal immigration officials to prioritize deportations from Democratic-run cities, a move that comes after large protests erupted in Los Angeles and other major metropolitan areas against the Trump administration's immigration policies.",
      "In a Truth Social post, the president called on U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials \"to do all in their power to achieve the very important goal of delivering the single largest Mass Deportation Program in History.\" He added that to reach the goal officials \"must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America's largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside.\"",
      "\"These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens,\" the president wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump's declaration comes after weeks of increased enforcement, and after Stephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff and main architect of the president's immigration policies, said ICE officers would target at least 3,000 arrests a day, up from about 650 a day during the first five months of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "At the same time, the Trump administration has directed ICE to halt arrests at farms, restaurants and hotels amid concerns that the president's\u00a0crackdown\u00a0on illegal immigration is hurting key industries, two sources familiar with the abrupt policy change told CBS News. The pause on worksite immigration enforcement operations applies to the\u00a0agricultural, hospitality and restaurant industries, which rely in large part on labor from immigrants, many of whom are in the U.S. unlawfully, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal actions.",
      "Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social site Thursday that he heard from hotel, agriculture and leisure industries that his \"very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them\" and promised that changes would be made.",
      "Opponents of the president's immigration policies took to the streets as part of the \"No Kings\" demonstrations Saturday that came as Mr. Trump held a massive parade in Washington for the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. The parade featured tanks, flyovers and fireworks.",
      "Mr. Trump made the call for stepped up enforcement in Democratic-controlled cities on social media as he was making his way to the Group of Seven economic summit in Alberta, Canada. The first thing on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was a bilateral meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. Mr. Trump met Carney at the White House last month. The rest of the day will consist of meetings with the G7 leaders, and the traditional \"family photo\" of those leaders and a cultural event.",

      "Senators are set to receive a security briefing from the Senate Sergeant at Arms and the U.S. Capitol Police on Tuesday. The briefing comes at the request of Senate Majority Leader John Thune and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer said Sunday that the bipartisan briefing would concern security for Senate members and the country more broadly.",
      "\"We have to reevaluate how we are protecting members of Congress and staffs in the face of rising threats, but we also have to look at protecting all American people as that happens,\" the New York Democrat said.",
      "Schumer said he also asked the Capitol Police to immediately increase security for senators following the attacks.",
      "He said the shootings are \"more than a regional tragedy.\"",

      "Members of the House, who are on recess this week, are set to be briefed virtually on Tuesday by the House Sergeant at Arms, multiple sources told CBS News. The briefing was organized by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, who said in a statement Saturday that he asked the Sergeant at Arms and Capitol Police to \"ensure the safety of our Minnesota delegation and Members of Congress across the country.\"",
      "The briefings come as the shootings raised concern about political violence and security concerns for elected officials. Former U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger, who retired from his post last month, told CBS News at the time that the threats facing members of Congress have accelerated over the past several years, and remain alarmingly high.",

    "summary": "Eric Coomer sued after Mike Lindell called him a traitor and accusations about him stealing the election were streamed on Lindell's online media platform.",
    "story": [
      "A federal jury in Colorado on Monday found that one of the nation's most prominent election conspiracy theorists, MyPillow founder\u00a0Mike Lindell, defamed a former employee of a leading voting equipment company after the 2020 presidential election.",
      "The employee, Eric Coomer, sued after Lindell called him a traitor and accusations about him stealing the election were streamed on Lindell's online media platform.",
      "Coomer was the security and product strategy director at Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems, whose voting machines became the target of elaborate conspiracy theories among allies of President Trump, who continues to falsely claim that his loss to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 was due to widespread fraud.",
      "Dominion won a $787 million settlement in a defamation lawsuit it filed against Fox News over its airing of false claims against the company and has another lawsuit against the conservative network Newsmax.",
      "Newsmax apologized to Coomer in 2021 for airing false allegations against him.",
      "Coomer said during the two-week Lindell trial that his career and life were destroyed by the statements. His lawyers said Lindell either knew the statements were lies, or conveyed them recklessly without knowing if they were true.",
      "Lindell's lawyers denied the claims and said his online platform, formerly known as Frankspeech, is not liable for statements made by others.",
      "Lindell said he went to trial to draw attention to the need to get rid of electronic voting machines that have been targeted in a web of conspiracy theories. He said he used to be worth about $60 million before he started speaking out about the 2020 election and is now $10 million in debt.",
      "Lindell recently used his defamation trial to boost sales of his pillows, linens and other products, as well as to raise money for his legal defense.",
      "On June 4, Lindell\u00a0wrote\u00a0on social media that \"My employee-owned company and I are in jury trial NOW and need your support!\" He included a link to a landing page on his company's website that includes the line, \"Use promo code JURY\" to receive a \"free Multi-Use MyPillow 2.0\" with any purchase. The website also includes a link to the \"Mike Lindell Legal Defense Fund,\" which asks for donations of between $10 to $1,000. The fundraising effort notes that Lindell has spent \"nearly all his resources ... to exposing corruption in our election systems.\"",
      "Reviews, recounts and audits in the battleground states where Mr. Trump contested his loss in 2020 all affirmed Democrat\u00a0Joe Biden's victory. Mr. Trump's\u00a0attorney general at the time said there was no evidence of widespread fraud, and Mr. Trump and his allies lost dozens of court cases\u00a0seeking to overturn the result.",
      "Lindell stuck by his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen during the trial, but did not call any experts to present evidence of his claims.",
      "Lindell said his beliefs that the 2020 election was tainted by fraud were influenced by watching the 2020 HBO documentary \"Kill Chain\" and by the views of Mr. Trump's former national security adviser,\u00a0Michael Flynn. In an interview for a documentary Lindell made in 2021, Flynn said foreign interference was going to happen in U.S. elections, and Lindell said he had no reason to doubt the claim since Flynn had worked for both political parties in intelligence.",
      "Lindell distanced himself from an account by a Colorado podcaster who claimed to have heard a conference call from the anti-fascist group Antifa before the 2020 election. The podcast claimed that on the call, someone named Eric from Dominion said he would make sure that Mr. Trump would not win, a story that was recounted on Frankspeech during a 2021 event. Lindell said he only learned about that during the trial.",
      "Lindell said he never accused Coomer of rigging the election, but he did say he was upset because he said Newsmax blocked him from being able to go on the air to talk about voting machines after it apologized to Coomer. Coomer denied there was any such deal to block Lindell under his agreement with the network.",
      "Coomer's lawyers tried to show how their client's life was devastated by the conspiracy theories spreading about him. Lindell was comparatively late to seize on Coomer, not mentioning him until February 2021, well after his name had been circulated by other Trump partisans.",
      "Coomer said the conspiracy theories cost him his job, his mental health and the life he'd built, and said Lindell's statements were the most distressing of all. He specifically pointed to a statement on May 9, 2021, when Lindell described what he believed Coomer had done as \"treason.\"",
      "Lindell's attorneys argued that Coomer's reputation was already in tatters by the time Lindell mentioned him. They said that was partly because of Coomer's own Facebook posts disparaging Mr. Trump, which the former Dominion employee acknowledged were \"hyperbolic\" and had been a mistake.",

In several cases, Stinson allegedly said he didn't have the skills to kill Mr. Trump himself, but said he's willing to \"serve in a support capacity\" or raise money for a \"contract hit.\"",

      "The American Bar Association sued the Trump administration Monday, arguing President Trump's wide-ranging push to punish law firms is unconstitutional. It joined\u00a0several targeted firms that have filed suit against the government.",
      "The lawsuit takes aim at a series of controversial orders signed by Mr. Trump that direct the government to cut off security clearances, contracts and even federal building access for some of the nation's largest law firms. The orders often fault the firms for taking on certain pro bono clients, associating with Mr. Trump's legal foes or engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion practices that the administration claims are discriminatory.",
      "The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., argues Mr. Trump has \"used the vast powers of the Executive Branch to coerce lawyers and law firms to abandon clients, causes, and policy positions the President does not like,\" in violation of the First Amendment.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields called the lawsuit \"clearly frivolous.\"",
      "\"The President has always had discretion over which contracts the government enters into and who receives security clearances. His exercise of these core executive functions cannot be dictated by the ABA, a private organization, or the courts. The Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue,\" Fields wrote in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The bar association's lawsuit cites the deals struck by several law firms, which promised hundreds of millions of dollars in pro bono work to causes favored by the administration in order to avoid future targeting by the government.",
      "It also argues the Trump administration's gambit has led to a \"chilling effect,\" intimidating some law firms into not taking pro bono cases that run counter to the Trump administration's agenda \u2014 especially in immigration-related matters.",
      "The American Bar Association said it has been a victim of this chilling effect. The organization, which counts hundreds of thousands of attorneys as members, wrote in the suit that it has had trouble finding law firms willing to represent it in pro bono cases.",
      "The group has tangled with the Trump administration in the past: The Justice Department has said it will not pay for its staff to attend ABA events and has taken aim at the ABA's diversity policies. The group sued the government earlier this year for cutting off some training grants, arguing it was being punished for protected speech, leading a judge to block the policy.",
      "The ABA alleged in Monday's suit that in a lawsuit over grant cutoffs, it \"was unable to obtain pro bono representation by any of the firms it contacted.\"",
      "The lawsuit asks a federal judge to declare that Mr. Trump's orders are unconstitutional and enjoin the administration from taking similar actions.",
      "\"Whoever wins the next election will be free to squelch dissent based on policy disagreements,\" the suit reads. \"There is no limiting principle: The next Administration might threaten adverse Executive Branch actions against any lawyer or law firm that dares to represent an oil company, or a gun manufacturer, or the Federalist Society or Fox News.\"",
      "Multiple law firms that were targeted by the Trump administration have sued over the orders, resulting in\u00a0 injunctions from federal judges\u00a0that sometimes lambasted\u00a0the administration. In one ruling that blocked the government from targeting Perkins Coie, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell said Mr. Trump's order sent the message that \"lawyers must stick to the party line, or else.\"",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",

    "summary": "President Trump is meeting with world leaders outside Calgary in Canada for the G7 summit.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 At an economic summit of world leaders in Canada Monday, President Trump weighed in on the Israel-Iran conflict, telling reporters Iran would \"like to talk, but they should have done that before.\"",
      "He told reporters as he met with Group of Seven summit host Prime Minister Mark Carney that Iran has \"to make a deal.\" The president confirmed that he's seen messages from Iran, through intermediaries indicating a wish to deescalate.",
      "\"They'd like to talk, but they should have done that before,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I had 60 days, and they had 60 days. On the 61st day, I said, 'we don't have a deal.' They have to make a deal, and it's painful for both parties. But I'd say Iran is not winning this war, and they should talk, and they should talk immediately, before it's too late.\"",
      "Asked what it would take for the U.S. military to get involved in the Iran situation, the president said, \"I don't want to talk about that.\"",
      "The summit, just outside of Calgary, comes as tensions between Israel and Iran boil over, now in their fourth day of open conflict. A draft G7 statement on Iran has been floated, but Mr. Trump does not plan to sign the statement, U.S. officials said. One U.S. official said Mr. Trump will continue to work toward ensuring Iran cannot obtain a nuclear weapon. The draft statement discusses monitoring Iran, calls for both sides to protect civilians, and re-ups commitments to peace, according to the officials.",
      "The meeting of world leaders is taking place as Mr. Trump's aides and top U.S. officials negotiate with these same allies over\u00a0tariffs he's imposed. First up on Mr. Trump's schedule Monday was the meeting with Carney, whom Mr. Trump met last month at the White House. The summit will continue into Tuesday.",
      "\"The G7 is nothing without U.S. leadership, and your personal leadership, the leadership of the United States,\" Carney told Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We've developed a very good relationship, and we're going to be talking about trade and many other things,\" Mr. Trump responded.",
      "\"I'm a tariff person. I've always been a tariff person,\" the president said alongside Carney.",
      "After meeting with U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Mr. Trump held up what he said was a trade agreement he said he and Starmer had just signed. Starmer said the document implements an agreement on car and aerospace tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump also held a private, one-on-one meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Monday, the White House said.",
      "Mr. Trump's attitude toward some U.S. allies as well as the\u00a0tariffs\u00a0he's launched throughout the world has made some of the U.S. relationships more tense and has been an undercurrent of the conversations Mr. Trump has on Monday. Mr. Trump's musings to\u00a0acquire Canada and Greenland\u00a0have also strained the United States' relationship with Canada.",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he'd consider allowing China to join the group of world leaders and brought up Russian President Vladimir Putin's ouster from the group in 2014 after he invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea.",
      "\"Putin speaks to me, he doesn't speak to anybody else,\" Mr. Trump said, as he stood next to Carney, who appeared to purse his lips and look away periodically as Mr. Trump spoke about Putin. \"He doesn't want to talk, because he was very insulted when he got thrown out of the G8. As I would be, as you would be, as anybody would be. It was very insulting.\"",
      "Carney told reporters his meeting with Mr. Trump was \"fantastic.\"",
      "\"We will have open, frank discussions over the course of two days,\" Carney said in the first session with all seven leaders present. \"We might not agree on absolutely every issue. But where we will cooperate, we will make an enormous difference for citizens and for the world, and bring the next era of prosperity, I hope, to the benefit of those we serve.\"",
      "When Mr. Trump met with Carney at the White House, the newly elected prime minister made it clear that Canada \u2014 contrary to Mr. Trump's public musings \u2014 is not for sale.",
      "\"As a real estate developer, you know, I'm a real estate developer at heart,\" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \"When you get rid of that artificially drawn line ... when you look at that beautiful formation when it's together, I'm a very artistic person.\"",
      "Carney interjected, using language he believed Mr. Trump as a real estate developer would understand.",
      "\"As you know from real estate, there are some places that are never for sale,\" Carney said. \"We're sitting in one right now, Buckingham Palace that you visited, as well. And having met with the owners of Canada over the course of the campaign the last several months, it's not for sale, it won't be for sale, ever. But the opportunity is in the partnership and what we can build together.\"",

    "story": [
      "Two leaders of some of the largest labor unions in the country say they are leaving the Democratic National Committee (DNC), citing disagreements with the committee's leadership over its future.",
      "Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, wrote in a June 5 resignation letter to DNC Chair Ken Martin that she felt \"out of step with the leadership you are forging.\"",
      "\"I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our communities,\" Weingarten wrote in the letter, obtained by CBS News.",
      "Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), declined his nomination as a member of the DNC weeks ago in a letter to Martin, his union confirmed. Saunders said his decision was about the future for working people and the party.",
      "\"These are new times. They demand new strategies, new thinking, and a renewed way of fighting for the values we hold dear. We must evolve to meet the urgency of this moment. This is not a time to close ranks or turn inward,\" Saunders said in a statement.",
      "Their two unions represent a combined membership of just over 3 million.",
      "Their departures come after a different internal controversy was settled on activist David Hogg, whose election as a party vice chair was voided by a committee vote in June. Hogg decided he would exit his role rather than run in a redo of the DNC vice chair elections.",
      "The vote to hold new vice chair elections came amid internal disagreements over Hogg's plans to back primary challenges against incumbent Democrats, though the challenge that led to the new contests was technically unrelated to Hogg's controversies.",
      "Weingarten had been a DNC member since 2002, and a member of the Rules and Bylaws committee since 2009, but Martin took both her and Saunders off that committee and offered to let them remain as at-large members of the party. Both declined their nominations.",
      "Both Saunders and Weingarten supported Wisconsin Democratic Party Chair Ben Wikler, and not Martin, in this year's election for a new DNC chair. News of Saunders' and Weingarten's departures was first reported by The New York Times.",
      "A source close to the DNC, who was granted anonymity to talk about an internal issue, said that ever since \"the horse [Weingarten] bet on in the Chairs race lost, she has always been on the other side of the fence as Ken\u2013 this is no surprise.\"",
      "In reaction to the departure of the two labor union leaders, DNC Labor Council Chair Stuart Applebaum defended Martin and said he understands \"that workers are the backbone of the Democratic party.\"",
      "\"Martin is bringing new people into our tent, reasserting the strength of the Democratic Party, and is already winning races to make us competitive in every part of the country,\" he said.",

    "published": "Wed, 11 Jun 2025 11:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Apex predators, like the Tyrannosaurus rex, eventually arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroid dinosaurs called Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, the study's researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "More than 85 million years ago, a smaller-bodied ancestor of the Tyrannosaurus rex roamed the plains of Mongolia. The dinosaur's identity was unknown \u2014 until now.",
      "In a study\u00a0published Wednesday in Nature, scientists describe the identification of a new tyrannosauroid named Khankhuuluu mongoliensis. Apex predators, including the T. rex, eventually arose from these smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids, the study's researchers said.",
      "\"This species, Khankhuuluu, is the missing link between smaller and earlier forms and the larger apex predatory tyrannosaurs,\" paleontologist Darla Zelenitsky, a professor at the University of Calgary and study co-author, told CBS News.",
      "The Khankhuuluu's skeleton was discovered in Mongolia in the Gobi Desert in 1972 or 1973, but wasn't studied scientifically until a few years later, Zelenitsky said. The remains were identified by Mongolian paleontologist Altangerel Perle as Alectrosaurus olsoni, another obscure species. After it was misidentified, the bones became part of a museum collection and were relatively untouched for almost 50 years.",
      "Referred to as mid-grade tyrannosauroids, these smaller-bodied predators were evolutionary intermediates, the study found. During the period when Khankhuuluu lived in Mongolia, the tyrannosaurs began growing larger and taking on the features of apex predators. Not much else is known about these elusive tyrannosauroids due to fragmentary fossil remains, but researchers said the dinosaurs weighed around 1,700 pounds. They were one of the larger predators in the ecosystem at the time.",
      "\"It's essentially the immediate ancestor of the tyrannosaur family,\" Zelenitsky said.",
      "A surprise discovery",
      "University of Calgary postdoctoral scholar and study co-author Jared Voris traveled to Mongolia a few years earlier to research the bones of various tyrannosaurs and, in the process, gained access to see the bones of what they would later determine are the Khankhuuluu.",
      "Voris thought the remains could be something important, as he often saw references to the specimens pop up, but after he started examining the bones, he knew it could be something special. While studying the individual characteristics of the bones, one of the things he noticed was that the Khankhuuluu's teeth couldn't crush bone, Voris said, a defining characteristic of the larger apex predatory Tyrannosaurus.",
      "\"This animal had features we had never seen before in more of our iconic tyrannosaurs,\" Voris said.",
      "He texted Zelenitsky from Mongolia that he \"thought it could be a new species.\" Zelenitsky said she responded, \"I said, great going, keep looking at this so we can be sure this is a new species.\"",
      "The two paleontologists aren't new to groundbreaking scientific discoveries \u2014 they've had several.\u00a0In 2023, Zelenitsky was part of a team that identified a Tyrannosaurus fossil with a meal in its stomach, and Voris discovered a new species of tyrannosaurid dinosaur, Thanatotheristes degrootorum \u2014 whose genus name translates to \"Reaper of Death.\"",
      "\"Rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs\"",
      "These Asian tyrannosauroids eventually crossed over into North America using a northern land bridge between Alaska and Siberia, Zelenitsky said. Dinosaurs used these land bridges, which appeared periodically over the past 100 million years, to travel between Asia and North America.",
      "And from it, these tyrannosauroids evolved and morphed into apex predators. T. rex is the\u00a0deadliest land predator\u00a0ever to live, and there has long been a fascination with the dinosaur that has been extinct for about 66 million years.",
      "The study co-authors said the new identification shows there are still big discoveries to be made in science. \"What really started just as a discovery of a new species ended up with us kind of rewriting a family history of tyrannosaurs,\" Zelenitsky said.",

      "NASA is evaluating apparently successful efforts by Russian cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station to seal up small-but-persistent air leaks in a vestibule leading to an aft docking port, the U.S. space agency said Saturday.",
      "Pending additional analysis to verify the initial results, NASA said in a blog post the delayed launch of the privately-funded Axiom-4 research mission to the station could come as early as Thursday.",
      "The agency did not provide any additional launch details, but based on the space station's orbit and rendezvous requirements, a Thursday takeoff would be targeted for 4:53 a.m. EDT.",
      "If that schedule holds up, commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu would aim for a docking at the space-facing port of the station's Harmony module around 10:30 a.m. on Friday.",
      "The flight originally was planned for last Tuesday but it was repeatedly delayed, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by troubleshooting to find an oxygen leak in the first stage of the crew's Falcon 9 rocket.",
      "While SpaceX worked to resolve the oxygen propellant leak, NASA managers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to stop or minimize air leaks in a Russian vestibule, known as the PrK, that serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019 and up to now, efforts to seal them off have been unsuccessful. But on Friday, Roscosmos, the Russian federal space agency, reported cosmonauts aboard the station had successfully eliminated the leaks in the PrK.",
      "\"Following the most recent repair, pressure in the transfer tunnel has been stable,\" NASA confirmed in a blog post Saturday. \"This could indicate the small leaks have been sealed.\"",
      "The leak rates seen earlier could be related to \"a small amount of air flowing into the transfer tunnel across the hatch seal from the main part of the station,\" NASA said.",

    "story": [
      "Concern about a small but persistent air leak in a Russian compartment of the International Space Station has prompted NASA and Axiom Space to indefinitely delay this week's launch of a commercial flight to the orbiting outpost, officials said Thursday.",
      "The privately-financed Axiom-4 crew \u2014 commander Peggy Whitson, Indian pilot Shubhanshu Shukla, Polish researcher S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu \u2014 originally planned to take off Tuesday.",
      "But the flight was delayed to the end of the week, first by high winds in the off-shore emergency splashdown zone and then by an oxygen leak in their Falcon 9 rocket's first stage. SpaceX tentatively targeted Thursday and then Friday for launch, with Saturday and Sunday available if needed.",
      "But during SpaceX troubleshooting to find and fix the rocket's propellant leak, NASA engineers decided they needed more time to assess recent efforts to plug an air leak aboard the International Space Station in a Russian vestibule known as the PrK. The PrK serves as a passageway between the station's Zvezda module and spacecraft docked at its aft port.",
      "\"Teams met today and we will not be launching Axiom-4 tomorrow,\" flight controllers in Houston radioed the ISS. \"We are assessing a new launch date. This is due to the ongoing PrK investigation. So I don't have a new launch date right now, but we will not be launching tomorrow and docking Saturday.\"",
      "In a blog post, NASA said cosmonauts aboard the station \"recently performed inspections of the pressurized module's interior surfaces, sealed some additional areas of interest, and measured the current leak rate. Following this effort, the segment now is holding pressure.\"",
      "The post went on to say  the Axiom-4 delay will provide \"additional time for NASA and (the Russian space agency) Roscosmos to evaluate the situation and determine whether any additional troubleshooting is necessary.\"",
      "Launched in July 2000 atop a Russian Proton rocket, Zvezda was the third module to join the growing space station, providing a command center for Russian cosmonauts, crew quarters, the aft docking port and two additional ports now occupied by airlock and research modules.",
      "The leakage was first noticed in 2019, and has been openly discussed ever since by NASA during periodic reviews and space station news briefings. The leak rate has varied, but has stayed in the neighborhood of around 1-to-2 pounds per day.",
      "\"The station is not young,\" astronaut Mike Barratt said last November during a post flight news conference. \"It's been up there for quite a while, and you expect some wear and tear, and we're seeing that in the form of some cracks that have formed.\"",
      "The Russians have made a variety of attempts to patch a suspect crack and other possible sources of leakage, but air has continued to escape into space.",
      "In November, Bob Cabana, a former astronaut and NASA manager who chaired the agency's ISS Advisory Committee, said U.S. and Russian engineers \"don't have a common understanding of what the likely root cause is, or the severity of the consequences of these leaks.\"",
      "\"The Russian position is that the most probable cause of the PrK cracks is high cyclic fatigue caused by micro vibrations,\" Cabana said. \"NASA believes the PrK cracks are likely multi-causal including pressure and mechanical stress, residual stress, material properties and environmental exposures.",
      "\"The Russians believe that continued operations are safe, but they can't prove to our satisfaction that they are, and the US believes that it's not safe, but we can't prove that to the Russian satisfaction that that's the case.\"",
      "As an interim step, the hatch leading to the PrK and the station's aft docking compartment is closed during daily operations and only opened when the Russians need to unload a visiting Progress cargo ship.",
      "And as an added precaution on NASA's part, whenever the hatch to the PrK and docking compartment is open, a hatch between the Russian and U.S. segments of the station is closed.",
      "\"We've taken a very conservative approach to close a hatch between the US side and the Russian side during those time periods,\" Barratt said. \"It's not a comfortable thing, but it is the best agreement between all the smart people on both sides. And it's something that we crew live with and enact.\"",
      "Cabana said last year that the Russians do not believe \"catastrophic disintegration of the PrK is realistic (but) NASA has expressed concerns about the structural integrity of the PrK and the possibility of a catastrophic failure.\"",

      "Kraft Heinz, the manufacturer of foods such as Jell-O, Capri Sun and Kool-Aid, said in an online statement that 10% of its products contain the dyes and that it has invested in removing the colors or replacing them with natural colors.",
      "Kraft Heinz replaced artificial dyes in its Kraft Mac & Cheese product in 2016, while some other products, including Heinz Tomato Ketchup, have never had dyes, the company said. Kraft Heinz's announcement comes amid a push from U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to root out artificial dyes from the nation's food supply and instead replace them with natural dyes.",
      "\"The vast majority of our products use natural or no colors, and we've been on a journey to reduce our use of FD&C (Food, Drug & Cosmetic) colors across the remainder of our portfolio,\" said Pedro Navio, North America president at Kraft Heinz in the company's statement.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve Bank is expected to hold its benchmark rate steady at its meeting on Wednesday, maintaining the same cautious posture it has assumed throughout the first half of 2025.",
      "That's according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool, which as of June 18, 2025, shows a likelihood of 99.9% that the Fed will keep the federal funds rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. CME Group is the parent company of the Chicago Board of Trade and other exchanges.",
      "The benchmark interest rate has been at its current range since December.",
      "The Fed has held off on cutting rates since President Trump took office, citing uncertainty around the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been publicly urging the Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, most recently this month, after a new employment report showed job creation slowed in May.",
      "Keeping the rate unchanged would signal ongoing caution from the Fed as it continues to monitor how Mr. Trump's economic policies will play out.",
      "\"Recent Fed commentary has reinforced a wait-and-see approach, with officials signaling little urgency to adjust policy amid increased uncertainty around the economic outlook,\" EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco said in a research note.",
      "While consumer sentiment has improved somewhat, the uncertainty brought on by the president's tariffs hasn't fully faded. The inflation rate also\u00a0ticked up slightly\u00a0in May to 2.4%, compared with 2.3% in April.",
      "Even though job growth is slowing, the labor market continues to hold up, with payroll gains\u00a0exceeding economists' expectations\u00a0last month.",
      "\"The current data do not support that theory that prices are rising or that the labor market is weakening quickly,\" said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Here's what to know about the Fed's next meeting.",
      "What date is the Fed's next meeting?",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee \u2014 the 12-member group that sets rate decisions \u2014 will meet on June 17-18. The FOMC's decision will be announced on Wednesday, the second day of the meeting.",
      "What time is the Fed rate announcement?",
      "The Fed will share the rate decision at 2 p.m. EST on June 18. Powell will then discuss the committee's decision at a press conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. that same day.",
      "The meeting will also include an economic forecast that touches on how interest rates are expected to change in coming years.",
      "One thing to watch will be whether the decision is unanimous, or if there is any dissent from voting members, said Mulberry. A divided decision would mark a shift from May's meeting, when\u00a0all 12 members\u00a0voted to hold the benchmark rate steady.",
      "\"Some members have been expressing concerns about slowing growth, although very slightly, and that should be debated heavily as a driver to cut rates sooner rather than continuing to pause,\" he said in an email.",
      "What are the odds of a Fed rate cut?",
      "Not likely. Echoing CME's data, economist polled by FactSet predict a 97.5% probability the Fed will maintain its benchmark rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.",
      "\"There is a tendency to romanticize the idea of interest rates coming down, but with the economy chugging along and a lot of uncertainty about what happens with inflation, there is nothing compelling the Fed to cut interest rates right now,\" said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate, in an email.",
      "The last time the Fed made a reduction was in December 2024, when it slashed rates by 0.25 percentage points.",
      "What does the Fed's decision mean for your money?",
      "While the Fed's decision to hold rates steady may be unwelcome news for the nation's borrowers, it would bode well for savers who benefit from higher interest rates. Schulz said now is to the time for people to shop for high-yield savings accounts or to lock in CD rates. \"Those returns aren't as high as they were a year ago, but they're still really strong,\" he said in an email.",
      "The moment could also be ripe for paying down high-cost credit card debt and padding your emergency savings, said McBride.",
      "If the Fed holds steady, Americans can expect credit card rates, auto loans and mortgages to remain high. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is currently hovering around 7% while credit card rates have skyrocketed to\u00a0over 20%.",
      "But that's not to say that a rate cute would necessarily bring down borrowing rates for homebuyers, said Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst for LendingTree, in a research note.",
      "\"Even a Fed rate cut isn't a guarantee that mortgage rates would fall, since the Fed doesn't impact mortgage rates as directly as it does credit cards,\" said Schulz. \"However, the Fed does impact rates indirectly, so a rate cut, whenever it eventually arrives, would likely be a hopeful signal for shoppers.\"",

      "The details of the golden share were disclosed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Saturday in a social media post, where he described the agreement as including \"powerful terms that directly benefit and protect America, Pennsylvania, the great steelworkers of U.S. Steel and U.S. manufacturers that will have massively expanded access to domestically produced steel.\"",
      "What is a golden share?",
      "A \"golden share\" refers to special rights held by a government over a corporate entity. They are typically granted in relation to newly privatized businesses over which the government wants to maintain some control,\u00a0according to legal research company Westlaw.",
      "Golden shares have been employed in countries ranging from the U.K. to China, although they are rare in the U.S. In the former case, the U.K. government held a golden share in the British Airports Authority, although it was ruled illegal by a court in 2003. In the latter, the Communist Party had taken a percentage ownership in private companies as well as control over government board seats and voting power, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported in 2023.",
      "While presidents can indirectly influence corporate decisions through agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission, which reviews mergers for antitrust concerns, it's unusual for a commander-in-chief to exercise the level of control outlined by Lutnick regarding U.S. Steel. According to his post, U.S. Steel \u2014 which would keep its name and headquarters after the merger \u2014 also wouldn't be allowed to change its name from U.S. Steel without President Trump's approval.",
      "The president has the authority to name one of the corporate board's independent three directors and can veto the other two choices, the Associated Press reported, citing a person familiar with the terms of the agreement who insisted on anonymity to discuss them. The details of the board structure were first reported by The New York Times.",
      "\"The Art of the Deal,\" Lutnick wrote of the agreement, referencing Mr. Trump's best-selling book about his business skills and negotiating techniques.",
      "Terms remain unclear",
      "Lutnick described the golden share in the U.S. Steel deal as \"perpetual.\" The Commerce Department didn't return a request for clarification on if the golden share would transfer to subsequent presidents after Mr. Trump leaves office.",
      "The full terms also remain somewhat unclear. The companies have not made public the full terms of Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel nor the national security agreement with the federal government.",
      "On Friday, the two companies\u00a0announced in a joint statement\u00a0that they had agreed to the terms of the government's national security agreement. They added the terms mandate $11 billion in new investments by 2028 and provides for \"a Golden Share to be issued to the U.S. Government.\"",
      "The U.S. Steelworkers union told CBS MoneyWatch that it can't comment on the golden shares without seeing more information about the agreement. But it pointed to a June 15 statement that expressed the union's disappointment with the president's decision to move forward with the merger.",
      "\"Details matter: Neither the government nor the companies have publicly identified what all the terms of the proposed transaction are,\" the union letter said. \"And, while there is a claimed 'golden share,' what can we expect from Nippon's leadership in Japan which continues to build up overcapacity in steel globally and has been charged again with dumping by the Department of Commerce just weeks ago?\"",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge struck down sweeping Trump administration orders that resulted in the cancellation of hundreds of National Institutes of Health research grants because they were linked to topics like diversity, gender identity and vaccine hesitancy.",
      "\"The ideologically motivated directives to terminate grants alleged to constitute DEI, 'gender ideology,' or other forbidden topics were, in fact, arbitrary and capricious, and have now been ruled unlawful,\" Dr. Peter Lurie, head of the Center for Science in the Public Interest said in a statement Tuesday. Lurie's group was among those that filed the lawsuit.",
      "Judge William Young of the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts capped a trial Monday for multiple lawsuits that were filed against the Trump administration: one by a coalition of public health groups and another by several Democratic state attorneys general.",
      "It is possible that the Trump administration could seek to block the ruling by Young, who was nominated to the court by President Reagan in 1985.",
      "\"HHS is exploring all legal options, including filing an appeal and moving to stay the order,\" Andrew Nixon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, said in a statement.",
      "Nixon said the department \"stands by its decision to end funding for research that prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people,\" saying the department wanted taxpayer dollars to support \"gold standard science\" and not \"divisive DEI mandates or gender ideology.\"",
      "The court has not yet published Young's order in the case, but notes from the clerk announced that the challenged directives have been vacated and that the Trump administration was ordered to \"promptly comply.\"",
      "Separate court cases are underway for other cuts to medical research funding sought by the Trump administration, like the terminations of funding to universities like Harvard and Columbia that have disrupted studies for cancer and diseases.",
      "Another federal judge in Massachusetts earlier this year blocked the NIH from implementing a policy change that would have cut funding for research overhead costs, which is now being appealed by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Today's court ruling halted the cancellation of millions of dollars that have already been awarded to address important public health needs and will allow funding for life-saving medical research to continue,\" the Massachusetts attorney general's office said Monday in a statement.",
      "They said that the judge had \"denounced these actions\" at the trial, saying he had \"never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable\" and would \"be blind not to call it out.\"",
      "Young's ruling came after opponents challenged the process used by the Trump administration to come up with and implement its steep cuts to grants, saying the law requires federal agencies changing their policies to \"supply a reasoned analysis for the change.\"",
      "Flaws cited by a trial brief brought by the groups included the lack of a definition for what qualified as banned \"DEI studies\" and NIH Acting Director Dr. Matthew Memoli having spent only minutes deciding which grants and funding opportunities to cut.",
      "\"Defendants do not explain how lightning speed implementation of the Directives could possibly reflect reasoned decisionmaking,\" they wrote.",

      "Virginia Democrats on Tuesday are voting for their nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general, rounding out the statewide ticket and setting the stage for a bellwether election later this year.",
      "Most of the nominees slated to be at the top of the November ticket have already been picked, and Republicans aren't having a statewide primary.",
      "In the race for governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger, whose candidacy thwarted prospective primary challengers, will go up against Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears \u2014 the only Republican who qualified for the ballot. Republicans have also solidified nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general.",

      "Analysts will be looking for clues in both states about voter sentiment with President Trump back in the Oval Office and Republicans controlling power in Washington.",
      "National Democrats' hold on Virginia has slipped in recent years, moving it close to swing-state status nationally. Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin beat former Gov. Terry McAuliffe in 2021. And although Democrats narrowly gained back complete control of the legislature in a 2023 election, then-Vice President Kamala Harris won Virginia last year by less than six points, compared to former President Joe Biden's 10-point lead in 2020.",
      "Still, Democrats have history on their side: The party of the sitting president typically suffers defeat in Virginia's statewide races. And considering Mr. Trump has never won the state, Democrats are probably better positioned to make gains once their ticket solidifies.",
      "The six Democrats vying to be Virginia's next lieutenant governor aren't all that different on the issues: They support rights to abortion, a living wage, affordable housing and accessible health care. They also share similar criticisms of the president.",

      "Jones, who once represented Norfolk in the House of Delegates, comes from a long line of Hampton Roads politicians. His father was also a delegate, and his grandfather was the first Black member of the Norfolk School Board. Jones previously ran for attorney general in 2021 but lost the primary to Democratic incumbent Mark Herring.",
      "Taylor has served more than a decade as the top prosecutor in the suburbs outside Richmond after flipping the open seat in 2011. Notable cases include when she was appointed special prosecutor in the case of the torch-carrying mob in the fatal 2017 Unite the Right white supremacist riot. She took one of the torch carriers to trial, records show, but the case was dismissed after a hung verdict.",
      "Only one Republican candidate in each statewide contest is advancing to the ballot.",

      "\"We almost immediately started getting 911 calls for rescue of people being trapped,\" Lou Vargo, Ohio County's emergency management director, said at a news conference Sunday. \"During this time, we had major infrastructure damage to roads, bridges, and highways, where we couldn't respond to a lot of incidents.

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate is moving toward final passage on a landmark piece of legislation to regulate crypto after a bumpy path through the upper chamber.",
      "The bill, known as the GENIUS Act, would establish a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar.",
      "It advanced out of the Senate Banking Committee in March with bipartisan backing, but bled Democratic support weeks later when it was revealed that an Abu Dhabi-backed firm would use $2 billion in stablecoin purchased from Trump family-linked crypto firm, World Liberty Financial, to invest in Binance.",
      "Concerns about President Trump and his family's business ventures involving cryptocurrency raised the sense of urgency for Democrats, who pushed for stronger provisions to safeguard against corruption while protecting consumers, the financial system and national security.",

      "The changes include requiring members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors and directing the Treasury to issue formal rules for monitoring suspicious transactions.",
      "Still, some Democrats say their concerns have not been addressed, and they've complained that they will not have the ability to amend the bill. Although Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, initially planned to allow an open amendment process, he reconsidered after at least one amendment from Republican Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas on credit card transaction fees threatened to sink the bill if adopted.",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, was among the bill's top detractors. She helped rally Democrats to sink the bill in the initial vote, arguing that \"this weak bill is worse than no bill at all.\" Before the bill advanced in another procedural vote last week, Warren unsuccessfully called on her colleagues to \"show a little spine and insist on amendments as the price for helping advance this bill.\"",
      "More than 100 amendments were offered from Democrats and Republicans on issues ranging from barring the president, vice president and other top government officials from profiting from stablecoin ventures while in office to prohibiting large online platforms from issuing the digital assets.",

Paul doesn't see a need for federal regulation of the industry, while Hawley has warned that it cedes too much power to tech giants.",
      "Democratic Sen. Kirstin Gillibrand of New York, who worked on the bill, defended the framework as long overdue.",

The vehicle \"looked exactly like an SUV squad car,\" equipped with emergency lights, Bruley said. The individual was wearing a vest with a Taser, badge and other equipment, Bruley said. Bruley said the individual appeared to have knocked on the door of the home.",
      "The Brooklyn Park officers confronted the man, who Burley said \"immediately\" fired and exchanged gunshots with officers, Bruley said. The individual then retreated into the home, Bruley said. The police officers then entered the home and saw that Hortman's husband had been shot. They attempted to render first aid, but he did not survive. A drone was then used to search the rest of the home and found Hortman dead inside.",
      "Bruley said the individual was \"clearly\" impersonating a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.\" Doorbell camera footage from the home of one of the victims showed the suspect appearing to be wearing a mask concealing his full head and face.",
      "A search of the man's vehicle found a document that named other lawmakers and officials, Bruley said. Evans said both Hoffman and Hortman were included on the list but he did not elaborate on any other names.",
      "Sources said there was an extensive list of possible targets among writings found in the vehicle \u2014 more than 50 individuals, some of them officials beyond Minnesota, including abortion rights advocates and abortion facilities.",
      "A stack of \"No Kings\" flyers was also found inside the vehicle, the Minnesota State Patrol said on social media. The flyers referenced the anti-Trump protests that took place\u00a0in cities nationwide on Saturday. After the shooting, all \"No Kings\" events planned for Minnesota were canceled. Law enforcement appeared concerned the suspect was planning to target the protests, and the Minnesota State Patrol asked that people planning to attend the events avoid them out of an abundance of caution.",
      "Suspect Vance L. Boelter in custody",
      "The suspect, 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, was arrested near his home in Green Isle, Sibley County, on Sunday night. Multiple local police and sheriff departments, along with state and federal agencies were involved in the nearly 43-hour-long manhunt.",
      "Boelter faces state and federal charges. The Hennepin County Attorney's Office in Minnesota filed charges Saturday for second-degree murder and attempted murder in order to obtain a nationwide search warrant, which were the highest charges the office could file at that time, said Mary Frances Moriarty, the county attorney. However, Moriarty told reporters at a news conference Monday that the office intends to seek first-degree murder charges, which would carry a penalty of life in prison without the possibility of parole if Boelter is convicted.",
      "Federal authorities have also brought charges against Boelter, including two counts each of stalking, murder and shooting the Hortmans and Hoffmans.",
      "Investigators had been searching the Sibley County area after a vehicle belonging to Boelter was found. Brooklyn Park Police Chief Bruley said that one officer thought he saw Boelter run into the woods and a large perimeter was set up. Investigators later got further information that Boelter had been seen in the woods, and multiple SWAT teams were called in. After authorities closed in on Boelter, he \"crawled to law enforcement teams,\" according to Minnesota State Patrol Lt. Col. Jeremy Geiger.",
      "He was armed at the time, but Boelter was taken into custody without any use of force, Geiger said.",
      "Police said it was the largest manhunt in Minnesota history.",
      "The face of evil. After relentless and determined police work, the killer is now in custody. Thanks to the dedication of...",
      "Earlier Sunday, an emergency alert sent to residents of Sibley County said authorities found a vehicle belonging to the suspect in Faxon Township, which is roughly 20 miles away, CBS Minnesota reported. Although Boelter's known address is the home in the Sibley County town of Green Isle, a law enforcement source told CBS Minnesota that the suspect had most recently been living at a home in north Minneapolis.",
      "Suspect's work history",
      "Boelter is\u00a0listed\u00a0as director of security patrols on the website of Praetorian Guard Security Services, where his wife is named president and CEO. However, Boelter's roommate told CBS News that, while it was the suspect's \"dream\" to have his own security company, he did not actually have one.",
      "\"It seems he bought the two cars for the security company, but he had no clients and he had no business,\" the roommate told CBS News. \"He had no employees and wasn't doing any security for anyone.\"",
      "In a\u00a0profile\u00a0on the website of Minnesota Africans United, which is no longer active, he is also described as the company's CEO.",
      "In a\u00a0LinkedIn\u00a0post last month, Boelter said he was \"looking to get back into the U.S. Food Industry\" after spending three years on projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a company where he has been listed as chief executive since 2021. In an undated video posted online, he\u00a0said\u00a0that while working to develop projects in Congo, he started working at Minnesota funeral homes \"to help pay the bills.\"",
      "Suspect served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman",
      "Boelter served on a Minnesota state board with Hoffman, records obtained by CBS News show.",
      "Boelter was first appointed to the Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Board in 2016 by then-Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton as a private-sector representative, with a term lasting through 2019, according to state records. Walz reappointed him that year as a business member, a position he held until January 2023.",
      "Records show that Hoffman served on the 60-member board during both of Boelter's terms. Of the board's members,\u00a041 are appointed by the governor, while legislative leaders name two state senators and two representatives.",
      "The board advises the governor and legislature on policies aimed at strengthening Minnesota's workforce and improving its competitiveness, according to its\u00a0website.",
      "Boelter's roommate, in response to rumors circulating online about the suspect's politics, told CBS News, \"He's not a Democrat. He would be offended if people called him a Democrat,\" adding that Boelter \"was a Trump supporter, voted for Trump,\" and was happy President Trump won the 2024 election.",
      "In a news conference Saturday, authorities said they were investigating whether Boelter knew Hoffman or Hortman.",
      "Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said there was \"certainly some overlap with some public meetings\" between Hoffman and Boelter, but that they had not determined \"the nature of the relationship or if they actually knew each other.\"",
      "In a post on LinkedIn on the day of the 2018 midterm elections, Boelter\u00a0posted about the importance of voting in elections.",
      "\"I am very big on just telling people to be a part of the process and vote your values and be part of this adventure we are all a part of living in the United States of America,\" he wrote.",
      "Who was Rep. Melissa Hortman?",
      "Hortman, 55, represented Minnesota House District 34B. She was the top House Democratic leader in the state Legislature and a former House speaker. A lawyer, Hortman was first elected to office in 2004.",
      "She and her husband, Mark, have two children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, who said they are \"devastated and heartbroken\" in a written statement released Monday night.",
      "\"They were the bright lights at the center of our lives, and we can't believe they are gone,\" the statement said. \"Their love for us was boundless. We miss them so much.\"",
      "Walz called the deaths of Hortman and her husband \"a political assassination.\" In a later statement, Walz said that Minnesota had lost a \"great leader\" and that he had \"lost a friend.\"",
      "\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place. She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness,\" Walz said.",
      "DNC Chair Ken Martin, who was the chair of the state Democratic Party in Minnesota for 14 years, said Hortman was a \"close friend\" whom he had known since the start of his political career.",
      "\"As I said many times when I introduced her at events, she is the very best Speaker of the House that Minnesota has ever had,\" Martin said.",
      "Before Hortman was killed, the Minnesota state House was evenly divided 67-67. In the state Senate, Democrats hold a one-seat majority.",
      "Who is State Sen. John Hoffman?",
      "Hoffman, 60, is a Democrat who represents Minnesota Senate District 34, which covers a swath of northwest Twin Cities suburbs. He was first elected in 2012 and has been reelected three times.",
      "He served as chair of the Human Services Committee, and also served on committees for energy, environment and health and human services, CBS Minnesota reported.",
      "He and his wife Yvette were each shot multiple times, Walz said. They are out of surgery and are receiving care, Walz said. He added that his \"prayers are with\" the couple.",
      "John Hoffman got out of his final surgery and was \"moving toward recovery\" Sunday night, Walz said.",
      "The Hoffmans have one daughter. The Hoffmans' nephew said Yvette Hoffman jumped on their daughter, Hope, to\u00a0shield her\u00a0from the gunfire.",
      "Officials denounce political violence",
      "Gov. Walz said Americans \"don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint,\" and emphasized that the shootings followed a special session where both sides compromised for the good of Minnesota.",
      "\"In the state of Minnesota, and as recently as last week, in the most closely divided state legislature in the country, we sat down, shook hands and compromised, and we served the state of Minnesota together,\" Walz said. \"It's possible in politically charged times to find compromise, democracy and civil discourse. I, Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence.\"",
      "Walz also thanked the responding officers, who he said showed \"bravery and swift action.\"",
      "\"We will spare no resource in bringing those responsible to justice. We will not let fear win,\" Walz said.",
      "President Trump said in a statement that he had been briefed on the \"terrible shooting.\" He said Attorney General Pam Bondi and the FBI are investigating the situation and would prosecute anyone involved \"to the fullest extent of the law.\"",
      "\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America,\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\"",
      "Sen. Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat, and Rep. Tom Emmer, a Minnesota Republican, responded to the shootings in a joint statement issued alongside all members of the Minnesota Congressional Delegation.",
      "\"Today we speak with one voice to express our outrage, grief, and condemnation of this horrible attack on public servants,\" the statement said. \"There is no place in our democracy for politically-motivated violence. We are praying for John and Yvette's recovery and we grieve the loss of Melissa and Mark with their family, colleagues, and Minnesotans across the state. We are grateful for law enforcement's swift response to the situation and continued efforts.\"",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he has asked Capitol Police to increase security for both Minnesota senators, Klobuchar and Tina Smith. Schumer also said he has asked Senate Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway and Senate Majority Leader John Thune to convene a full briefing as soon as senators return to Washington.",
      "\"As we continue to follow this terrifying situation, I urge everyone to stay safe, stay vigilant, and reject political violence in all its forms,\" Schumer said. \"But condemning violence while ignoring what fuels it is not enough. We must confront the toxic forces radicalizing individuals and we must do more to protect one another, our democracy, and the values that bind us as Americans.\"",
      "Former Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona, who was shot in the head in 2011 at a supermarket in Tucson, Arizona, in an assassination attempt by a lone gunman that killed six people and wounded 12 others, said in a statement Saturday that she was \"horrified and heartbroken\" by the shootings.",
      "\"My family and I know the horror of a targeted shooting all too well,\" said Giffords, who is married to Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"An attack against lawmakers is an attack on American democracy itself. Leaders must speak out and condemn the fomenting violent extremism that threatens everything this country stands for.\"",
      "U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said, \"Such horrific political violence has no place in our society, and every leader must unequivocally condemn it.\"",

He used to plow Boelter's driveway in the winter, and like his neighbors, he's left with more questions than answers.",
      "\"He never had any political views that we talked about. It was always about the weather, what's going on. How's your family,\" said Effertz. \"A guy, you shake your hand with him and everything else, and he does this, which is really strange.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump Organization announced it is starting a cellular phone service called T1 Phone by Trump Mobile that will charge $47.45 a month and include unlimited calls, text and data. It also plans to roll out a new $499 phone that will be built in the U.S.",
      "The new service was designed to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of President Trump's announcement of his first presidential run, the Trump Organization\u00a0said\u00a0in a Monday statement.",
      "The company said its mobile phone plan, which it dubbed the 47 Plan in a nod to Mr. Trump's current rank as the 47th U.S. president, won't require a contract or a credit check. In an interview on \"Mornings with Maria\" on Fox Business, Eric Trump \u2014 Mr. Trump's son and the executive vice president of the Trump Organization \u2014 said the new phone and service will align with his father's policy plans to boost American manufacturing and employment.",
      "\"We want to have customer service by Americans for Americans,\" Eric Trump said in the Monday interview. \"We want to have phones built by Americans, for Americans, and, you know, and we want to do it better than anybody. We're going to disrupt the space.\"",
      "The new mobile phone and service takes direct aim at phone manufacturers such as Apple, which has faced pressure from Mr. Trump to shift its manufacturing from China and India to the U.S. Last month, the president\u00a0threatened to impose a 25% tariff\u00a0on Apple products if the computer giant didn't reshore some of its manufacturing.",
      "If Apple were to build its iPhones in the U.S., they would cost about $3,500 each, more than triple their current retail price of about $1,000, because of the higher cost of manufacturing in the U.S., Wedbush analyst Dan Ives has said.",
      "Ethics issues raised",
      "The new Trump phone and cellular service raise a host of ethics issues, said Robert Weissman, the co-president of Public Citizen, a consumer rights advocacy group. Rival phone companies and manufacturers could face a dilemma if they have a cheaper phone or service, he noted.",

      "And if the phone is made with foreign-made parts, it raises issues about whether the company could get a break on the Trump administration's tariffs.",

      "The Trump Mobile plan will \"revolutionize cell phones, mobile calling,\" Eric Trump told Fox Business.",

    "summary": "Dr. Fiona Havers' resignation follows RFK Jr.'s orders to change the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official who led the agency's network to study hospitalization trends from infectious diseases like COVID-19 has resigned in protest following Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s orders to change the agency's vaccine recommendations and the committee that makes them.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers' last day at the CDC was Monday, according to an announcement sent by an agency official to her branch within the agency's Coronavirus and Other Respiratory Viruses Division. They received the notice shortly after Reuters first reported on the resignation.",
      "\"I no longer have confidence that these data will be used objectively or evaluated with appropriate scientific rigor to make evidence-based vaccine policy decisions,\" Havers wrote in an email sent to colleagues before the announcement.",
      "An infectious disease researcher who has worked with Havers, and received her email voicing concerns with how the data would be used, described the resignation as the latest in the \"dismantling\" of the agency's expertise.",
      "\"It's a big loss to the CDC,\" the researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told CBS News.",
      "CBS News sent a request for comment to the CDC about the concerns that Havers expressed, but did not hear back from the agency's spokesperson. Instead, a spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services responded.",
      "\"Under Secretary Kennedy's leadership, HHS is committed to following the gold standard of scientific integrity. Vaccine policy decisions will be based on objective data, transparent analysis, and evidence \u2013 not conflicts of interest or industry influence,\" Emily Hilliard, the department spokesperson, said in an email.",
      "Havers had led the CDC's Respiratory Virus Hospitalization Surveillance Network, or RESP-NET, that collects and studies trends in hospitalizations from COVID-19, RSV and influenza. Her presentations of RESP-NET's findings have figured prominently into past meetings of the agency's Advisory Committee of Immunization Practices as they weighed updates to the CDC's vaccine recommendations.",
      "\"Of all the work we have accomplished, I am most proud of how COVID-NET and RSV-NET hospitalization data, presented at nearly every public ACIP meeting since 2020, have been critical drivers of COVID-19 and RSV vaccine policy in recent years,\" Havers wrote in her email.",
      "The CDC's vaccine recommendations are closely watched by doctors and health authorities because they are tied to federal policies enabling access to vaccines, including liability protections and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "Usually, the ACIP deliberates and votes on updated recommendations, which are later adopted by the CDC director. In an unprecedented move this year, Kennedy bypassed the process to order his own changes.",
      "In late May, Kennedy first ordered narrowing the guidance to exclude children and pregnant women without other underlying health conditions, sidestepping an ACIP process that had been already underway to discuss changing the recommendations.",
      "He then fired the current roster of ACIP members in June \u2014 in what he described as a \"clean sweep\" of the panel \u2014 as well as removed the agency officials who oversee the panel's vetting and agenda.",
      "In a viewpoint published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, the 17 members of the panel fired by Kennedy denounced the health secretary for \"dismantling the process by which vaccines have been recommended.\"",
      "\"As former ACIP members, we are deeply concerned that these destabilizing decisions, made without clear rationale, may roll back the achievements of US immunization policy, impact people's access to lifesaving vaccines, and ultimately put US families at risk of dangerous and preventable illnesses,\" they wrote.",
      "Kennedy later replaced the panel with a list of picks that included several allies of the health secretary and opponents of recommendations for COVID-19 and some other vaccines.",
      "The committee's new membership is set to meet next week to vote on updated vaccine recommendations for COVID-19 and RSV, among other diseases.",

      "WhatsApp has announced a series of new features that will change the way people interact with brands on the Meta-owned messaging platform and give companies more chances to cash in on user engagement.",
      "The changes, to be rolled out over the next few months according to Meta, expand and monetize the functions of WhatsApp's \"Updates\" tab, which has historically been a place for users to follow news and updates from their favorite companies, news organizations and celebrities. A new subscription model on the tab will allow channel admins to offer users exclusive content for a monthly fee.",
      "\"This means channel owners will be able to share exclusive in-the-moment updates with their most engaged followers, and they'll be able to earn money while doing so,\" said Nikila Srinivasan, vice president for product management at Meta said on a call with reporters.",
      "Channels will remain free for WhatsApp users. However, channel admins will have an option to set a monthly fee within a range if they opt to utilize the subscription model, according to a Meta spokesperson.",
      "Channels will also have the ability to promote their content to get in front of users more easily by buying ads or boosting their channel through Ads Manager. \"Similar to how it works on Facebook and Instagram, businesses decide how much they want to spend based on their objectives,\" the spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Integrating ads",
      "WhatsApp is also planning on integrating ads into the \"Updates\" tab which will allow users to message brands directly if they see a product or service they want, or have a customer service question. Up until this point, users had to click on ads on Instagram or Facebook to open up a WhatsApp chat with a company.",
      "\"People really want to chat to businesses on their own terms, and they want to do it in a place where they already spend their time, which is on WhatsApp,\" said Srinivasan.",
      "Srinivasan said the new ad feature will allow businesses, such as Verizon, Wendy's and L'Or\u00e9al to attract more customers directly on the messaging platform.",
      "\"This is going to enable businesses like them to do even more,\" she said. WhatsApp will roll out the new features to a global audience over the next few months, according to Srinivasan.",
      "Meta introduced the \"Updates\" tab on WhatsApp a year ago. It's now visited by 1.5 billion people on a daily basis. WhatsApp's \"Chats\" tab, where users send and receive messages, will remain end-to-end encrypted and will not be used to show ads, Srinivasan said.",

    "summary": "Trump says he's not \"looking for a ceasefire\" in the Israel-Iran war, as he warns all of Tehran's residents to evacuate and says Iran should be \"giving up\" its nuclear program entirely.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said early Tuesday morning that he wants \"a real end\" to Iran's nuclear problem, with Tehran \"giving up entirely\" its enrichment activities. He said he was not just working toward a ceasefire to end the war between Iran and Israel, which has claimed at least two dozen lives in Israel and hundreds in Iran as it enters its fifth day.",
      "\"I didn't say I was looking for a ceasefire,\" Mr. Trump told reporters on Air Force One after\u00a0cutting short his time at the G7 summit in Canada.",
      "Earlier, the president\u00a0said on his Truth Social platform\u00a0that French President Emmanuel Macron had \"mistakenly said that I left the G7 Summit, in Canada, to go back to D.C. to work on a 'cease fire' between Israel and Iran. Wrong! He has no idea why I am now on my way to Washington, but it certainly has nothing to do with a Cease Fire. Much bigger than that.\"",
      "Mr. Trump predicted that Israel would not slow its assault on Iran, which has largely decapitated the Islamic republic's military command and inflicted significant damage to its controversial nuclear program.",
      "\"You're going to find out over the next two days. You're going to find out. Nobody's slowed up so far,\" he said, hours after issuing an ominous warning that all of Tehran's roughly 10 million inhabitants should \"immediately evacuate.\"",
      "Asked about that warning on Air Force One early Tuesday, Mr. Trump said he wanted \"people to be safe,\" without offering any further explanation. Israel on Monday warned about 300,000 residents in a central district of Tehran to evacuate, pending attacks in the area.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested the reason he didn't want to stay in Canada was because he couldn't confidentially monitor developments in the Middle East. He said he could be \"more well versed\" in the White House Situation Room and avoid cellphones. \"I don't believe in telephones \u2014 because people like you listen to them,\" he told reporters on the plane. \"Being on the scene is much better.\"",
      "A source with knowledge of the talks told CBS News on Monday that Tehran had indicated to negotiators in Qatar and Oman that it was prepared to discuss a new deal with the U.S. on its nuclear program, but not while it was still under Israeli attack.",
      "The president said it was possible he could send special envoy Steve Witkoff or Vice President JD Vance, or both, to meet with Iranian negotiators, but \"it depends what happens when I get back\" to Washington.",
      "\"I don't know,\" Mr. Trump added. \"I'm not too much in the mood to negotiate.\"",
      "Addressing any possible threat to U.S. interests in the region, Mr. Trump said Iran knew not to target U.S. forces, as the U.S. would \"come down so hard if they do anything to our people.\"",
      "The president declined to say whether Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Lt. Gen. Dan Caine and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had provided him with options in the event Iran does attack U.S. bases in the Middle East.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" he said.",
      "Asked if it would take U.S. involvement to destroy Iran's nuclear program, Mr. Trump said he hoped it would be \"wiped out long before that.\"",
      "Vance says Trump has \"shown remarkable restraint\" but \"may decide he needs to take further action\"",
      "Vance weighed in on the Iran situation and Mr. Trump's response in a lengthy social media post Tuesday morning. Vance said the president has \"shown remarkable restraint\" in how he uses the U.S. military and that people are \"right to be worried about foreign entanglement,\" but argued the president has \"earned some trust on this issue.\"",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump \"may decide he needs to take further action to end Iranian enrichment,\" a decision that \"ultimately belongs to the president.\"",
      "\"And having seen this up close and personal, I can assure you that he is only interested in using the American military to accomplish the American people's goals,\" Vance wrote. \"Whatever he does, that is his focus.\"",
      "Trump says Iran was \"very close\" to obtaining a nuclear weapon",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has framed the attack he ordered on Iran late last week as an \"existential\" battle for Israel's survival. He claimed intelligence \u2014 which Israel has not shared publicly \u2014 showed the country was \"racing\" toward the development of a nuclear weapon. Netanyahu, along with all recent U.S. presidents including Mr. Trump, have always said they could not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "Just several months ago, however, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard delivered an assessment to lawmakers that said U.S. agencies continued \"to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme leader Khomeini has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.\"",
      "Gabbard said the U.S. was continuing to \"monitor closely if Tehran decides to reauthorize its nuclear weapons program,\" and she noted that \"in the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing nuclear weapons in public likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision-making apparatus.\"",
      "Asked on Air Force One about that assessment from Gabbard, that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon, Mr. Trump told reporters: \"I don't care what she said. I think they were very close to having them.\"",
      "Israel expands assault on Iran",
      "Israel expanded its aerial assault on Iran Monday, hitting not only nuclear and military facilities and assassinating senior military leaders, but targeting the regime-controlled media. Iranian State TV's sprawling headquarters in Tehran came under attack as the network was broadcasting.",
      "CBS News' Seyed Bathaei in Tehran said the network remained on the air, but that one part of its compound was on fire Monday evening.",
      "Asked about the strike on Tuesday, Israel Defense Forces spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said the network \"was used to spread anti-Israeli propaganda and called for genocide for several decades. We attacked it just as we attack all components of the Iranian terrorist regime and the plan to destroy Israel.\"",
      "In a clear show of domination over its long-time archrival, Israel also said Tuesday that it had killed the Iranian military's chief of staff Ali Shadmani, just four days after his predecessor was killed in Israel's first round of strikes.",
      "\"Following precise intelligence received by the Intelligence Branch, we eliminated Ali Shadamnai, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime. He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation.\"",
      "The attacks have sent thousands of Iranians racing to try to evacuate major cities. A massive explosion in the city of Isfahan was caught on someone's dashcam over the weekend as the passengers tried to flee.",
      "\"We can't leave. What else can we do,\" the car's anxious occupants can be heard saying.",
      "The human cost of the war is escalating on both sides. Iranian officials haven't provided an update since Sunday, when they said at least 220 people had been killed. They did not give a breakdown but said many civilians were among the casualties",
      "In Israel, Netanyahu said Monday that at least 24 people had been killed by Iranian missiles that managed to evade the country's robust air defenses.",
      "The attacks continued Monday evening and into Tuesday morning, with Defrin saying Iran had launched 30 missiles, most of them intercepted, \"but several hits were identified.\"",
      "He did not report any new casualties, but warned Israelis: \"We must not be complacent, the Iranians still have intentions and the ability to strike.\"",
      "On Monday, an Iranian missile slammed into an apartment building in the central Israel city of Peta Tikva, killing four people.",
      "Israeli American Lihi Griner was there, with her husband and three children, hiding in their safe room.",
      "\"It was the biggest boom ever,\" she told CBS News. \"Even our safe room was shaking.\"",
      "When the family emerged, they found shattered glass strewn across their apartment.",
      "Given Mr. Trump's warnings and Netanyahu's stated determination to remove what he considers the multi-faceted threat posed by the Iranian regime, CBS News asked Griner if she was prepared for the war with Iran to get worse before it gets better.",
      "\"I'm not prepared,\" she said. \"I'm just gonna go and run in my little, you know, bomb shelter. I'm not prepared for everything. I wasn't prepared for this.\"",

    "summary": "Israel's defense chief has warned that Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei could meet the same fate as Saddam Hussein, but would killing him end the war?",
    "story": [
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not ruled out assassinating Iran's 86-year-old supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the figurehead of what he calls an \"existential\" threat to Israel. Netanyahu has made it clear that Israel would like to see, and even help to precipitate a change of regime in Iran, which has been ruled by a hardline theocratic government since the 1979 Islamic revolution.",
      "On Friday, after ordering the first attacks on Iran's nuclear sites, Netanyahu said: \"Israel's fight is not against the Iranian people. Our fight is against the murderous Islamic regime that oppresses and impoverishes you.\"",
      "He urged the people of Iran \"to unite around its flag and its historic legacy, by standing up for your freedom from the evil and oppressive regime,\" adding, \"This is your opportunity to stand up and let your voices be heard.\"",
      "Asked by ABC News in an interview that aired Monday if Israel would try to kill Khamenei, Netanyahu would only say that his country was \"doing what we need to do.\"",
      "He rejected suggestions that such a move would be escalatory, however, saying: \"It's not going to escalate the conflict, it's going to end the conflict.\"",
      "Israel's strikes hit Khamenei's inner circle",
      "\"I imagine the supreme leader is currently unable to sleep and worried about whether he'll be alive or not,\" Holly Dagres, a regional expert and senior fellow at the Washington Institute think tank in Washington, D.C., told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Israel's ongoing strikes have killed several of Iran's top generals and security advisers to the ayatollah, dealing a blow to his inner circle, which, according to the Reuters news agency, consists of only 15 to 20 trusted loyalists. The dead include the commander-in-chief of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Hossein Salami, the chief of Iran's ballistic missile program Amir Ali Hajizadeh, and spy chief Mohammad Kazemi.",
      "On Tuesday, Israel's military boasted about killing the man tapped to replace the Iranian military's chief of staff, just four days after it killed his predecessor in its first round of strikes.",
      "\"We eliminated Ali Shadmani, the Chief of Staff of the War, the most senior military commander of the Iranian regime,\" Israeli military spokesman Brigadier General Effie Defrin said Tuesday. \"He was eliminated at the Iranian regime's headquarters in the heart of Tehran. Shadmani was the Chief of Staff of the Iranian regime's armed forces and the man closest to Iran's leader Khamenei. He was appointed to replace the previous Chief of Staff, whom we also thwarted in the opening blow of the operation. He only managed to fill the position for 4 days.\"",
      "But even if Israel were to kill the ayatollah himself, Dagres said Iran's clerical regime has an established process in place to keep the government stable.",
      "Iran is not run by \"one man and some generals\"",
      "\"The thing with the Islamic Republic is this isn't just one man and some generals,\" Dagres told CBS News. \"This is a system or an apparatus that has been thought through very extensively. The Islamic Republic has something that's akin to the (Vatican's) College of Cardinals \u2014 the Assembly of Experts, and they actually determine who gets to be supreme leader.\"",
      "The top-level religious body, also known as Iran's Council of Experts, is composed of 88 senior Islamic clerics who are responsible for electing Iran's supreme leader, usually when the current one dies.",
      "\"From what we've been seeing so far, it doesn't sound like any of those people have been targeted\" by Israel, said Dagres. \"This is a replaceable regime in terms of leadership at the top, because they're prepared for the eventual death of a supreme leader.\"",
      "Even if Iran's entire theocratic system of government were to collapse, the upheaval would not necessarily guarantee a new government that is any friendlier to Iran's own repressed people, to Israel, or to the United States.",
      "\"There could be a scenario where the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps takes over, and they could go in different directions,\" said Dagres. \"They could be more authoritarian. They can be more Western-friendly. We don't know. I think one of the lessons of the Arab Spring, up until the fall of Assad, was that what happens isn't always better.\"",
      "Those Arab Spring pro-democracy uprisings across the Middle East in 2010 \u2014 in Egypt, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Tunisia \u2014 were initially met with hope in the democratic Western world, but in most of those countries, the bids for democracy either devolved into civil war, or were beaten back by new or returning authoritarian regimes or the rise of extremist groups.",
      "Could internal tension threaten Iran's regime?",
      "Echoing Netanyahu, Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned Iran's supreme leader on Tuesday he could suffer a fate similar to Iraq's former President Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi strongman's regime fell in 2003 after nearly a quarter century. He was found hiding in a bunker by U.S. forces and was then sentenced to death by a special Iraqi tribunal and hanged for crimes against humanity.",
      "\"I warn the Iranian dictator against continuing to commit war crimes and launch missiles toward Israeli civilians,\" Katz said on Tuesday. \"He should remember what happened to the dictator in the neighboring country to Iran who took the same path against Israel.\"",
      "Alon Pinkas, a former Israeli diplomat and commentator in Tel Aviv, told CBS News on Tuesday that the \"kinds of tensions that cause a regime to fall are usually internal, not external.\"",
      "\"A country of 10 million cannot precipitate a regime change in a country of 90 million,\" Pinkas noted, highlighting the vast discrepancy in size between Israel and the much larger Iran, which he noted was also 1,100 miles away.",
      "\"For that to happen, for a regime change to happen, you need basically a reenactment of the failed Iraq invasion [by the U.S.] of 2003,\" Pinkas said. \"And I don't think anyone wants that, certainly not the Americans.\"",
      "He views Netanyahu's call for Iranians to rise up against their own leadership as \"sheer arrogance.\"",
      "\"I doubt anyone living in Tehran and listening to Netanyahu would say, 'Oh, wow, you know, this is a call for action, I should get out and fight the regime because Mr. Netanyahu, a thousand miles away, told me to do so.'\"",
      "The last time mass anti-government street protests erupted in Iran was in 2022 with the so-called \"Woman, Life, Freedom\" movement. That outrage was sparked by the death of 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran's religious police, reportedly after being detained for an improper head covering.",
      "Netanyahu has repeated the three-word protest refrain in messages aimed directly at Iranians since his country launched its attacks late last week.",
      "But those protests in Iran were quashed quickly \u2014 and aggressively \u2014 by Iranian authorities and had died down by the spring of 2023.",
      "Since Israel started bombing Iran last week, no one has taken to the streets in Iranian cities. The country's residents appear to be focusing on the immediate threat, scrambling for shelter and to evacuate major cities as Israeli bombs fall.",
      "\"Why would you be on the streets if Israeli jets are bombarding those very streets or bombarding military targets not far from you,\" noted Pinkas. \"They're driving away, as far away as possible from Tehran\u2026 but I think that when the dust settles \u2014 and that could be in two, three days, it could also be in three weeks, I honestly cannot predict that \u2014 I think a lot of that anger will be taken out on the regime.\"",
      "In other words, even if Israel's actions don't prompt an immediate toppling of Iran's Islamic rulers, it could fuel Iranians' determination to stand up to their clerical leaders. If that happens, it could come at one of the ayatollah's weakest moments in almost half a century.",

      "Russia fired more than 440 drones and 32 missiles, Ukrainian President Volodymyr\u00a0Zelenskyy said on X, calling the Kyiv assault \"one of the most horrific attacks\" and \"pure terrorism.\" At least 14 people were killed as explosions echoed across Kyiv for almost nine hours, Kyiv City Military Administration head Tymur Tkachenko said, destroying dozens of apartments.",

      "Asked on Monday why he's leaving the summit, Mr. Trump said, \"I have to be back early for obvious reasons.\"",
      "As Air Force 1 taxied before departing Canada, Mr. Trump posted on his Truth Social platform that his early return to the capital wasn't related to any Israel-Iran ceasefire talks. French President Emmanuel Macron had brought up the possibility of a ceasefire earlier, drawing criticism from Mr. Trump.",

      "\"It's not going to escalate the conflict,\" Netanyahu contended. \"It's going to end the conflict.\" He blamed Iran for \"bringing us to the brink of nuclear war,\" and said that \"in fact, what Israel is doing is preventing this, bringing an end to this, this aggression, and we can only do so by standing up to the forces of evil.\"",
      "The Trump administration has also warned Iran against striking U.S. military bases in the region.",

      "A mayday call was sent by the flight captain, Sumeet Sabharwal, seconds after the London-bound plane left the runway in Ahmedabad.",
      "Rescue workers and investigators recovered the other black box, the flight data recorder, on Friday. That recorder logs reams of data from the various systems on modern passenger jets, everything from altitude and speed to engine performance. Black boxes are designed to survive crashes and are considered vital to air accident investigators in determining the cause of disasters.",

    "story": [
      "Residents in Spain and several other popular destinations in Europe protested against mass tourism Sunday, saying a flood of summer visitors is driving up housing costs in their cities and pushing out locals.",
      "Some of the protesters in Barcelona and on the Spanish island of Mallorca sprayed tourists with water guns.",
      "The protests were part of the first coordinated effort by activists concerned with the ills of overtourism across southern Europe's top destinations. While several thousands rallied in Mallorca in the biggest gathering of the day, hundreds more gathered in other Spanish cities, as well as in Venice, Italy, and Portugal's capital, Lisbon.",
      "\"The squirt guns are to bother the tourists a bit,\" Andreu Mart\u00ednez said in Barcelona with a chuckle after spritzing a couple seated at an outdoor caf\u00e9. \"Barcelona has been handed to the tourists. This is a fight to give Barcelona back to its residents.\"",
      "Mart\u00ednez, a 42-year-old administrative assistant, is one of a growing number of residents who are convinced that tourism has gone too far in the city of 1.7 million people. Barcelona hosted 15.5 million visitors last year eager to see Antoni Gaud\u00ed's La Sagrada Familia basilica and the Las Ramblas promenade.",
      "Mart\u00ednez says his rent has risen over 30% as more apartments in his neighborhood are rented to tourists for short-term stays. He said there is a knock-on effect of traditional stores being replaced by businesses catering to tourists, like souvenir shops, burger joints and \"bubble tea\" spots.",
      "\"Our lives, as lifelong residents of Barcelona, are coming to an end,\" he said. \"We are being pushed out systematically.\"",
      "Around 5,000 people gathered in Palma, the capital of Mallorca, with some toting water guns as well and chanting \"Everywhere you look, all you see are tourists.\" The tourists who were targeted by water blasts laughed it off. The Balearic island is a favorite for British and German sun-seekers. Housing costs have skyrocketed as homes are diverted to the short-term rental market.",
      "Hundreds more marched in Granada, in southern Spain, and in the northern city of San Sebasti\u00e1n, as well as the island of Ibiza.",
      "In Venice, a couple of dozen protesters unfurled a banner calling for a halt to new hotel beds in the lagoon city in front of two recently completed structures, one in the popular tourist destination's historic center where activists say the last resident, an elderly woman, was kicked out last year.",
      "Protesters in Barcelona blew whistles and held up homemade signs saying \"One more tourist, one less resident.\" They stuck stickers saying \"Citizen Self-Defense,\" in Catalan, and \"Tourist Go Home,\" in English, with a drawing of a water gun on the doors of hotels and hostels.",
      "There was tension when the march stopped in front of a large hostel, where a group emptied their water guns at two workers positioned in the entrance. They also set off firecrackers next to the hostel and opened a can of pink smoke. One worker spat at the protesters as he slammed the hostel's doors.",
      "American tourists Wanda and Bill Dorozenski were walking along Barcelona's main luxury shopping boulevard where the protest started. They received a squirt or two, but Wanda said it was actually refreshing given the 83 degree Fahrenheit weather.",
      "\"That's lovely, thank you sweetheart,\" she said to the squirter. \"I am not going to complain. These people are feeling something to them that is very personal, and is perhaps destroying some areas (of the city).\"",
      "There were also many marchers with water guns who didn't fire at bystanders and instead solely used them to spray themselves to keep cool.",
      "Cities across the world are struggling with how to cope with mass tourism and a boom in short-term rental platforms, like Airbnb, but perhaps nowhere has surging discontent been so evident as in Spain, where protesters in Barcelona first took to firing squirt guns at tourists during a protest last summer.",
      "There has also been a confluence of the pro-housing and anti-tourism struggles in Spain, whose 48 million residents welcomed a record 94 million international visitors in 2024. When thousands marched through the streets of Spain's capital in April, some held homemade signs saying \"Get Airbnb out of our neighborhoods.\"",
      "Spanish authorities are striving to show they hear the public outcry while not hurting an industry that contributes 12% of gross domestic product.",
      "Last month, Spain's government ordered Airbnb to remove almost 66,000 holiday rentals from the platform that it said had violated local rules.",
      "Spain's Consumer Rights Minister Pablo Bustinduy told The Associated Press shortly after the crackdown on Airbnb that the tourism sector \"cannot jeopardize the constitutional rights of the Spanish people,\" which enshrines their right to housing and well-being. Carlos Cuerpo, the economy minister, said in a separate interview that the government is aware it must tackle the unwanted side effects of mass tourism.",
      "The boldest move was made by Barcelona's town hall, which stunned Airbnb and other services who help rent properties to tourists by announcing last year the elimination of all 10,000 short-term rental licenses in the city by 2028.",
      "That sentiment was back in force on Sunday, where people held up signs saying \"Your Airbnb was my home.\"",
      "The short-term rental industry, for its part, believes it is being treated unfairly.",
      "\"I think a lot of our politicians have found an easy scapegoat to blame for the inefficiencies of their policies in terms of housing and tourism over the last 10, 15, 20 years,\" Airbnb's general director for Spain and Portugal, Jaime Rodr\u00edguez de Santiago, recently told the AP.",
      "That argument either hasn't trickled down to the ordinary residents of Barcelona, or isn't resonating.",
      "Txema Escorsa, a teacher in Barcelona, doesn't just oppose Airbnb in his home city, he has ceased to use it even when traveling elsewhere, out of principle.",
      "\"In the end, you realize that this is taking away housing from people,\" he said.",
      "In another strategy, last year, Barcelona's leaders launched a program to replace outdated infrastructure in public schools to address rising temperatures, paid for by a tax on tourists.",
      "\"The possibility of using these revenues, the tourism tax, for such a project is very important so that we can accept tourism in our city and the role that tourism has,\" Barcelona's Deputy Mayor Laia Bonet told CBS News at the time.",
      "But some residents say the program misses the point.",
      "\"The government should be doing this without depending on tourism \u2026 it's public health,\" activist Agnes Rodriguez said. \"If you're coming to Barcelona tonight, to Chicago or to New York, and you're staying in a tourist apartment where a family should be living, you are part of this city changing. You're affecting the life of people living there.\"",

      "Black walls were installed around the stands of five Israeli defense firms at the trade fair in Le Bourget, an airfield on the outskirts of Paris.",

      "French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou defended the decision during a Monday press conference at the air show.",
      "\"The French government's position was very simple: no offensive weapons at the arms exposition,\" he said. \"Defensive weapons were perfectly acceptable.\"",
      "Bayrou cited the ongoing conflict in Gaza as the rationale behind the ban.",
      "\"Given France's diplomatic choices, in particular the concern, or in any case, very great worries about Gaza, we could not not show that there was a certain distance, which meant that we did not think it acceptable that offensive weapons were in a show like that,\" said Bayrou. \"And as these offensive weapons were not withdrawn [by the Israeli companies], we have temporarily, I hope, closed the stands.\"",
      "At the last Paris Air Show in 2023, Israeli companies - including at least one that was subject to the closure of its stall on Monday - appear to have displayed offensive weapons, including laser-guided bombs and rockets and attack drones.",
      "Aviation news outlet Flight Global reported from the show on Monday that, despite Bayrou's description of a ban on displays of offensive weapons, \"manufacturers from other countries are freely displaying a range of combat aircraft and munitions,\" which it included a display by the French-owned company Dassault Aviation featuring a \"French air force Rafale fighter surrounded by a range of strike munitions.\"",

      "The presence of Israeli firms at Le Bourget, though smaller than in the past, was already a source of tension before the start of the Paris Air Show, because of the conflict in Gaza.",
      "A French court last week rejected a bid by NGOs to ban Israeli companies from Le Bourget over concerns about \"international crimes.\"",
      "Local lawmakers from the Seine-Saint-Denis department hosting the event were absent during Bayrou's visit to the opening of the air show in protest over the Israeli presence.",

    "summary": "A spontaneous strike at the Louvre erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts.",
    "story": [
      "The Louvre, the world's most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, was shuttered on Monday \u2014 not by war, not by terror, but by its own exhausted staff, who say the institution is crumbling from within.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization's greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "The spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \"untenable\" working conditions.",
      "It's a rare thing for the Louvre to close its doors to the public. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it felt quite like this: tourists lining the plaza, tickets in hand, with no clear explanation for why the museum had, without warning, simply stopped.",
      "\"It's the Mona Lisa moan out here,\" said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee, one of thousands of confused visitors corralled into unmoving lines beneath I.M. Pei's glass pyramid. \"Thousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\"",
      "The moment felt bigger than a labor protest. The Louvre has become a bellwether of global overtourism \u2014 a gilded palace overwhelmed by its own popularity. As tourism magnets from Venice to the Acropolis scramble to cap crowds, the world's most iconic museum is reaching a reckoning of its own.",
      "The disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decadelong plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle. But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\"We can't wait six years for help,\" said Sarah Sefian of the CGT-Culture union. \"Our teams are under pressure now. It's not just about the art \u2014 it's about the people protecting it.\"",
      "She said that what began as a scheduled monthly information session \"turned into a mass expression of exasperation.\" Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon. As of the early afternoon, the museum remained closed.",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid's greenhouse effect.",
      "At the center of it all, as always, is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience. Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum's largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci's enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\"You don't see a painting,\" said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \"You see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you're pushed out.\"",
      "Macron's renovation blueprint, dubbed the \"Louvre New Renaissance,\" promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \"no longer watertight,\" that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \"a physical ordeal.\"",
      "\"We have problems with the building,\" des Cars acknowledged to CBS News earlier this year. She said the issues are partly due to age, as the palace that houses the museum was initially constructed in the early 13th century.",
      "\"It's nine centuries of history, at the heart of Paris and at the heart of the history of France,\" said des Cars.",
      "She also said one of the objectives of the renovation is to improve visitor flow, so that people can find the collections they most want to see more easily \"and also discover the wonders of the Louvre.\"",
      "The full renovation plan \u2014 with a projected cost of 700 million to 800 million euros (around $810 million to $930 million) \u2014 is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds and licensing fees from the Louvre's Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",

The toll was the deadliest yet in the near-daily shootings that have taken place as thousands of Palestinians move through Israeli military-controlled areas to try to reach the food \"hubs\" run by the private contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation.",
      "Two witnesses said Israeli troops opened fire early Monday in an attempt to control the crowds. There was no immediate comment by the Israeli military. It has said after numerous previous instances that troops had fired warning shots at what it called suspect individuals approaching their positions.",
      "Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry said 33 Palestinians were killed trying to reach the GHF center near the southern city of Rafah on Monday while another was fatally shot trying to reach a GHF hub in central Gaza. It said four other people were killed elsewhere in the war-torn enclave.",
      "Two Palestinians trying to get food at the Rafah site, Heba Jouda and Mohammed Abed, told The Associated Press that Israeli forces fired on the crowds at around 4 a.m. at the Flag Roundabout. The traffic circle, hundreds of yards from the GHF center, has repeatedly been the scene of shootings. The military has designated specific routes to access the food centers, and GHF has warned aid-seekers that leaving the roads is dangerous, but many do in an attempt to get to the food first.",
      "Israel and the United States say the new GHF system is needed to prevent Hamas from siphoning off aid. GHF says there has been no violence in or around the sites themselves. The funding for and management of GHF have remained unclear since it began operations in mid-May, but it is staffed by private, well-armed American security contractors.",

They deny there is widespread theft of aid by Hamas.",
      "Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinians, UNRWA, slammed GHF in a statement on Monday as a \"lethal distribution system\" and lamented that \"tragedies go on unabated\" in Gaza \"while attention shifts elsewhere,\" in an apparent reference to the new outbreak of significant fighting between Israel and Iran.",

      "Iran said Israel struck its oil refineries, killed the intelligence chief of its paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and hit population centers in intensive aerial attacks that raised the death toll in the country since Israel launched its major campaign Friday to 224 people. Health authorities also reported that 1,277 were wounded, without distinguishing between military officials and civilians.",
      "Israel \u2014 widely believed to be the only nuclear-armed state in the Middle East \u2014 has aimed its missiles at Iran's rapidly advancing nuclear program and military leadership.

      "Above-ground section of Natanz facility destroyed",
      "Among the key sites Israel attacked was Iran's main nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz, where black smoke could be seen rising into the air. It also appeared to strike a second, smaller nuclear enrichment facility in Fordo, about 60 miles southeast of Tehran, according to an Iranian news outlet close to the government that reported hearing explosions nearby.",
      "Israel said it also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan, and said it destroyed dozens of radar installations and surface-to-air missile launchers in western Iran. Iran confirmed the strike at Isfahan.",
      "U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi told the Security Council that the above-ground section of the Natanz facility was destroyed. The main centrifuge facility underground did not appear to have been hit, but the loss of power could have damaged the infrastructure there, he said.",
      "Israel also struck a nuclear research facility in Isfahan. The International Atomic Energy Agency said four \"critical buildings\" were damaged, including its uranium conversion facility. It said there was no sign of increased radiation at Natanz or Isfahan.",
      "An Israeli military official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with official procedures, said that according to the army's initial assessment, \"it will take much more than a few weeks\" for Iran to repair the damage to the Natanz and Isfahan nuclear sites. The official said the army had \"concrete intelligence that production in Isfahan was for military purposes.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation,\" Cotton said Iran is \"close to having enough pure weapons-grade uranium for several weapons,\" and that's why both Mr. Trump and Netanyahu thought \"things were coming to a head\" with Thursday night's launch.",
      "\"A second reason is Iran is rapidly producing ballistic missiles, both medium range to target Israel, and short range to target our troops, and they add substantially to those stockpiles every single month,\" Cotton added. \"And at a time when Iran is both continuing its work on its nuclear program and trying to rebuild its offensive missile capacity, that the window to actually stop Iran from entering that zone of immunity was rapidly closing.\"",

      "The strikes \u2014 which the Israel Defense Forces said included dropping \"over 330 different munitions\" on more than 100 targets in Iran \u2014 prompted Iran to launch about 100 missiles at Israel in a retaliatory attack later Friday. The IDF said its Iron Dome missile defense system intercepted most of the missiles, and U.S. officials confirmed that the United States helped Israel intercept Iranian missiles.",
      "IDF spokesman Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin claimed intelligence showed \"the Iranian regime has made significant progress in achieving nuclear capability and its ability to act against us,\" calling it an emerging and existential threat to Israel. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. was not involved in Israel's airstrikes on Iran.",
      "The attacks came one day after the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board of Governors censured Iran for the first time in 20 years for not working with its inspectors. Iran immediately announced it would establish a third enrichment site in the country and swap out some centrifuges for more advanced ones.",
      "The IAEA is the United Nations' Vienna-based nuclear watchdog. It said in a confidential report last month that Iran has further increased its stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels, and called on Tehran to urgently change course and comply with the agency's probe.",

The president has previously said Iran cannot be allowed to enrich uranium, a term Iran has not been willing to accept. Steve Witkoff, the president's Middle East envoy, was set to hold a sixth round of talks with Iran in the Gulf state of Oman on Sunday.",
      "Here's a look at some major Iranian sites and their importance in Tehran's program.",
      "Natanz enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Natanz, located some 135 miles southeast of Tehran, is the country's main enrichment site.",
      "Part of the facility on Iran's Central Plateau is underground to defend against potential airstrikes. It operates multiple cascades, or groups of centrifuges working together to more quickly enrich uranium.",
      "Iran also is burrowing into the K\u016bh-e Kolang Gaz L\u0101, or Pickax Mountain, which is just beyond Natanz's southern fencing. Natanz has been targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, believed to be an Israeli and American creation, which destroyed Iranian centrifuges. Two separate sabotage attacks, attributed to Israel, also have struck the facility.",
      "In\u00a0testimony Friday before the U.N.\u00a0about Israel's strikes, IAEA Director-General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Iran confirmed that its Natanz Fuel Enrichment Plant had been attacked. He said the above-ground portion of the plant where Iran was producing uranium enriched up to 60% had \"been destroyed\" and centrifuges may have been damaged. He said Iranian authorities also reported attacks on the Fordow Fuel Enrichment Plant and Esfahan site.",
      "Fordo enrichment facility",
      "Iran's nuclear facility at Fordo is located some 60 miles southwest of Tehran. It also hosts centrifuge cascades, but isn't as big a facility as Natanz.",
      "Buried under a mountain and protected by anti-aircraft batteries,\u00a0Fordo appears designed to withstand airstrikes.",
      "Its construction began at least in 2007, according to the IAEA, although Iran only informed the U.N. nuclear watchdog about the facility in 2009 after the U.S. and allied Western intelligence agencies became aware of its existence.",
      "Bushehr nuclear power plant",
      "Iran's only commercial nuclear power plant is in Bushehr\u00a0on the Persian Gulf, some 465 miles south of Tehran. Construction on the plant began under Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in the mid-1970s. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the plant was repeatedly targeted in the Iran-Iraq war. Russia later completed construction of the facility.",
      "Iran is building two other reactors like it at the site. Bushehr is fueled by uranium produced in Russia, not Iran, and is monitored by the IAEA.",
      "Arak heavy water reactor",

      "Willie had been hesitant to believe Si in his Bigfoot sighting but admitted that finding the creature would be lucrative, so he gave hunting him down a fair shot.",
      "Elsewhere in the Robertson family, Willie's daughter, Bella, was doing some hunting of her own.",
      "Over at Duck Commander, there was a \"snack thief\" that she was adamant about catching. Bella set up a trap in the break room to find the thief, but was unlucky until her father ratted himself out. She laid out a bunch of beef jerky bags in the break room and Willie was seen later in the episode snacking on them.",

      "At the end of the episode, Willie planned a camping trip with his sons, John Luke and Will. One of his grandsons also made an appearance. Willie shared that he learned how to lure in Bigfoot. The group needed a campfire, flute music, a child for \"bait\" and singing. So, the group did just that.",
      "\"There's always a lot to fear with the unknown, whether that's a monster in the woods, a snack thief or even a new phase in life, but having\u00a0a close-knit family to face all the unknowns of life makes everything a little less scary.\"",
      "Goodwin of Duck Commander dressed up in a Bigfoot suit and ran near the group's campfire to spook Willie, and it worked. At the end of the episode, he admitted that he didn't think the group was going to find Bigfoot, so a lucrative documentary that Si pitched was out the window.",
      "But now that he's \"officially semi-retired,\" he tossed around the idea that he may create a fictional Bigfoot movie.",

      "The report adds that \"Memorial Hermann publicly claims not to offer gender-transition services to individuals under 18\" but, according to Do No Harm, \"has reportedly performed 15 sex-change surgeries on minors and prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy to three children.\"",

      "\"The Johns Hopkins All Children\u2019s website formerly included a page about children\u2019s gender and sexual development,\" the report says. \" It referred to the \u2018emotional and physical foundation for sexuality\"\u2019 among \u2018infants, toddlers, preschoolers, and young school-aged kids.\u2019\"",

      "A spokesperson for Memorial Hermann told Fox News Digital the report \"reflects information that is outdated, factually inaccurate and intentionally misleading.\"",
      "\"As one example of factually inaccurate information, Memorial Hermann does not provide and has never provided any form of pediatric gender transitioning treatment to patients younger than 18 years of age at any of our facilities. Secondly, we are compliant with all state and federal price transparency regulations.

We do not discriminate based on race, gender or any other characteristics, and we abide by ethical and legal standards of care. We are equally committed to ensuring our policies comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations.\"",
      "One of the top concerns outlined in the report is what Consumers\u2019 Research describes as \"insult to injury\" when it comes to federal tax dollars propping up these hospitals that are pushing \"woke\" ideologies and shelling out millions in salaries for top leadership.",
      "\"Nonprofit hospitals highlighted in this report and across the U.S. receive millions of dollars in federal funding, government-mandated savings programs, and tax exemptions,\" the report states.",
      "Memorial Hermann Health System in Texas was also highlighted by the report as an organization rife with examples of DEI. (Getty Images)",
      "\"This means taxpayers are often left footing the bill for hospitals\u2019 political activism. Hospitals receive nonprofit, tax-exempt status on the basis that they provide a broader benefit to the community. These health systems are able to couple their billions of dollars in tax savings with significant federal funding sources and government-mandated savings programs. These avenues for federal funding include Medicare payments, Medicaid payments, and federal grant funding.\"",
      "The report alleges that these hospitals often \"leverage their position\" to receive \"multiple special designations through Medicare and Medicaid that allow them access to more taxpayer dollars while arguing against federal cuts to current revenue streams.\"",
      "\"As outlined in this report, hospitals are taking advantage of their billions of dollars in tax breaks, federal funding, and mandated discount programs to fund frivolous projects outside the scope of patient care,\" the report alleges. \"Instead of passing benefits along to patients and lowering costs \u2013 as these programs intended \u2013 hospitals use these programs to fund political priorities outside of their core mission of providing high-quality care and benefiting their communities.\"",
      "In addition to the report, Consumers\u2019 Research has sent letters to President Trump, Senate and House leadership, and governors of the states where the hospitals are located calling for an investigation into the federal dollar funding streams to the organizations that could be violating anti-DEI rules and running counter to state values.",

      "Additionally, Consumers\u2019 Research is running a mobile billboard in Washington, D.C., and launching the website\u00a0BadMedicine.Org to highlight their warning to consumers.",
      "\"Consumers need to be aware that hospitals in their own backyards have found ways to use taxpayer dollars to advance a woke agenda, which takes away vital resources that should be going to patient care,\" Consumers' Research Executive Director Will Hild said in a statement to Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Our Consumer Warning spotlights five nonprofit hospitals that are prioritizing radical causes like DEI, child sex-change procedures, and climate activism, all while receiving millions in taxpayer dollars. Every hospital CEO should read this Consumer Warning and promptly end woke policies in their organizations and refocus on their core mission, which is providing the best quality patient care at affordable prices. Until every hospital in America stops pushing discriminatory DEI policies, mutilating kids' bodies, and promoting climate politics, their federal funding streams and other government benefits like tax-exemptions should be investigated to ensure taxpayers are not supporting any hospital's reckless ideological activism. It is time to stop funding woke hospitals.\"",

      "The committee, chaired by Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, walked a tightrope with the legislation, given the push and pull surrounding divisive cuts to Medicaid, an increase to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap and other provisions in the House\u2019s version of the bill.",
      "Crapo lauded the bill in a statement and noted that it made the president's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanent, slashed \"Green New Deal\" spending and targeted \"waste, fraud and abuse in spending programs while preserving and protecting them for the most vulnerable.\"",

      "But Republicans from New York and California have already come out in force against the proposed change and contended that lowering the cap at all was non-negotiable.",
      "\"Instead of undermining the deal already in place and putting the entire bill at risk, the Senate should work with us to keep our promise of historic tax relief and deliver on our Republican agenda,\" SALT Caucus co-chairs Reps.

      "Another stark departure in the Senate\u2019s healthcare language is Medicaid. Despite a cohort of Republicans warning to avoid deeper cuts that could lead to people being booted from their healthcare or negative effects on rural hospitals, lawmakers on the panel appear to have further dug in on slashes to the program.",
      "For example, the Senate\u2019s bill proposed halting an increase to the provider tax rate, or the amount that state Medicaid programs pay to healthcare providers on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries, for non-Affordable Care Act expansion states, and lowering the rate in expansion states annually until it hits 3.5 percent. The House version just paused the increase.",
      "The Senate\u2019s offering also lowered the House\u2019s proposed maximum Child Tax Credit from $2,500 to $2,200 while making the credit permanent. The House\u2019s bill offered the increased credit until 2029, at which point it would revert to $2,000.",
      "And on green energy tax credits, including those for electric vehicles, green energy upgrades to homes and others, the Senate offered more flexibility with their rollback timelines of Biden-era green energy subsidies ushered in by the Inflation Reduction Act.",
      "The House version moved up the expiration date for many credits to the end of this year, while the Senate's version tweaked the language in some places to allow for 90- and 180-day windows after the bill\u2019s enactment. In some cases, the credits were given an entire year before they were slated to expire.",

      "Notably, the committee\u2019s legislation would also increase the debt limit to $5 trillion, a $1 trillion hike over the House\u2019s offering. The inclusion of a debt limit hike has been a sore subject for Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., who has argued that he would prefer to vote on the debt limit separately.",
      "Part of the impetus to advance the Senate\u2019s version of the \"big, beautiful bill,\" however, is to beat the debt guillotine hanging over lawmakers\u2019 heads. The Treasury Department has forecast that Congress has until August to increase the debt limit.",

The account looked legitimate, but the funds never reached the organization.",
      "A similar scam is targeting Miles Perret Cancer Services, a nonprofit based in Louisiana.

      "1) Always access the payment app from the official app or website, and not from any third-party platforms or services.",
      "2) Look at the security settings that the payment app offers and make sure they\u2019re all set to the highest and most protective settings.",
      "3) Consider using a personal data removal service to protect your privacy and reduce your risk of scams.\u00a0Scammers who target payment apps like Venmo, Zelle, Cash App, and PayPal often rely on information found on data broker and people-search sites to craft convincing impersonations or phishing attempts. These sites can list your name, address, phone number, and even connections to organizations you support, making it easier for fraudsters to trick you or others into sending money to fake accounts.",
      "Personal data removal services work by automatically removing your information from hundreds of data broker sites, making it much harder for scammers to find and misuse your details. By scrubbing your data from these sources, you lower your risk of being targeted in payment app scams and reduce the likelihood that someone could impersonate you or a nonprofit you care about.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "4) Create a strong, unique and complex password for each of your mobile payment apps and change it often. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication, which means that you need to enter a code or use your fingerprint or face to unlock your account to prevent unauthorized access. This way, even if someone knows your password, they can\u2019t log in without your device or confirmation.",
      "6) Lock your device and log out of your apps. You should always lock your phone with a password, PIN, pattern, fingerprint, or face. Never share your password, PIN, or security code with anyone. You should also log out of your mobile payment apps after each use and turn off the auto-login feature. This way, even if someone takes or borrows your device, they can\u2019t access your mobile payment apps without your approval.",
      "7) Verify the identity and legitimacy of the sender or receiver. You should always check the name, photo, username, and contact information of the person or organization you are sending money to or receiving money from before accepting or sending any payment requests. You should also confirm the reason and amount of the transaction before you agree to it. If you are not sure or have any doubts, you should contact the person or organization directly through another way, such as a phone call, text message, or email, but only if you know for sure that those forms of communication are legitimate. You should never send money or give your account details to anyone you don\u2019t know or trust, or anyone who asks you to do so out of the blue.",
      "8) Link your Venmo to a credit card as opposed to a debit card, so you can dispute a charge from scammers more easily. However, keep in mind, linking a credit card to your payment app can provide additional protection in the event of fraud, but this can come with extra costs in terms of transaction fees.",
      "9) Try not to keep a balance in your money-transferring apps.\u00a0You have a much better chance of being helped by your bank or credit card company when it comes to fraud than you do from a money-transferring app.",
      "10) Use strong antivirus software and never click on links from unknown sources,\u00a0especially when an email or text appears to have come from the payment App. Protect yourself from accidentally clicking on malicious links by running antivirus software on your device.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "11) Monitor your account activity and report any suspicious or unauthorized transactions.\u00a0You should set up notifications from your payment app and your bank via text or email, and check your account activity regularly. Look for any signs of fraud, such as payments you didn\u2019t make or receive, or changes to your account settings or information.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Unlike traditional banks, which are bound by federal consumer protection laws and fraud resolution timelines, peer-to-peer payment apps operate in a much looser regulatory environment. Services like Venmo often state in their user agreements that they are not responsible for mistaken or unauthorized payments unless there is clear evidence of account compromise or technical malfunction. Venmo\u2019s only suggestion here was to respond to a support ticket and wait. There was no emergency fraud hotline, no dedicated contact for nonprofits, and no indication that urgent action would be taken. Payment apps that allow donations to flow as quickly as a text message must also bear the responsibility of keeping those transactions safe. When a nonprofit has to beg for support just to protect its own identity, something is broken.",

I thought it was Microsoft so I called the number. The guy was good. He gave me a name and employee number and we went through some things on my computer which brought up a screen that said 'scammers were listening' and my IP was being used on the Porn Hub. I thought, how could that be? But still, I was obtuse.",
      "\"The screen listed what he said were all my credit cards that had been compromised, but only the beginning numbers: 3xxx, 4xxx, 5xxx, etc. He said in order to make a report to the FTC I needed to tell him all of the numbers. I told him I was not going to do that even though he insisted I had to for the 'report.' Then he said he would transfer me to the FTC and gave me a number in case we were disconnected. A different guy answered, gave me his name and said he was Andrew Ferguson, head of the FTC.",
      "\"I've been in politics and business for over 50 years. I looked him up while still on the phone and realized the head of the FTC wouldn't be answering a support line. When I refused to give him my information, he yelled that my IP was being used on porn sites and didn't want to stop it. I hung up.",
      "\"I have great virus software on all my devices and use two-step authentication for almost everything - but I still almost fell for it. I'm sharing this story to help others.\"",
      "Pamela was fortunate. Her security measures and quick thinking saved her, but these tactics are becoming more common and more aggressive. Here's what you can do to stay safe.",
      "Beware of pop-up scams that impersonate Microsoft or the FTC",
      "Scammers often use alarming pop-up messages or automated voices claiming your device is compromised, urging you to call a number for help. As described in Pamela's experience, a pop-up claimed her computer was locked and played a voice message directing her to call what appeared to be a Microsoft support number. The scammer then impersonated both a Microsoft employee and a government official, using fake names and employee numbers, and tried to pressure her into revealing sensitive information.",
      "If you ever receive a pop-up or voice message claiming your device is at risk, do not call the number provided or share any personal information. Instead, contact the organization directly using official contact details from their website. Legitimate companies and government agencies will never ask you to provide sensitive information or credit card numbers over the phone in response to unsolicited pop-ups or calls.",
      "Protect your online accounts with strong, unique passwords",
      "Make sure each of your online accounts has a unique password. This prevents scammers from accessing multiple accounts if one gets compromised. While password generators provide secure passwords, you can also easily create one that's hard to crack by looking at three random things in the room and using them to form a password.\u00a0Consider using a\u00a0password manager for strong, unique passwords. A password manager helps you generate and securely store complex, unique passwords for each of your accounts. This prevents you from reusing passwords and makes it much harder for scammers to access multiple accounts if one is compromised.

It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Report online scams to these official authorities",
      "If you encounter a scam, reporting it to the proper authorities can help you recover lost funds and prevent others from falling victim to the same scam. By reporting scams, you contribute to a database that allows law enforcement to track patterns and catch criminals. Places you can report to include the\u00a0FTC, your local FBI office, the\u00a0IC3 and your state's consumer protection office.",

The database was publicly accessible online, unprotected by passwords or authentication protocols. Anyone with basic knowledge of database scanning tools could have accessed it.",

      "Medical identity theft allows attackers to impersonate patients and access services under a false identity. Victims often remain unaware until significant damage is done, ranging from incorrect medical records to unpaid bills in their names. The leak also opens the door to insurance fraud, with actors using institutional references and chart data to submit false claims.",
      "This type of breach raises questions about compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which mandates strong security protections for entities handling patient data.

      "If your information was part of the healthcare breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the healthcare data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs. Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The healthcare data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.",
      "One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "3. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Hackers have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "5. Be wary of mailbox communications: Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If nothing else, this latest leak shows just how poorly patient data is being handled today. More and more, non-medical vendors are getting access to sensitive information without facing the same rules or oversight as hospitals and clinics. These third-party services are now a regular part of how patients book appointments, pay bills or fill out forms. But when something goes wrong, the fallout is just as serious. Even though the database was taken offline, the bigger problem hasn't gone away. Your data is only as safe as the least careful company that gets access to it.",

    "story": [
      "The technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline.",
      "Recently, Aircela, a fuel company headquartered in New York, publicly demonstrated a machine in Manhattan that produces gasoline directly from air.",
      "The event attracted city and state officials, investors and energy professionals who witnessed the launch of this compact, refrigerator-sized unit.",
      "Aircela's technology combines direct air capture with on-site fuel synthesis, providing fossil-free gasoline that is fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure.",

      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Understanding the science behind Aircela's technology",
      "Led by co-founder and CEO Eric Dahlgren (pictured on the right below), Aircela has\u00a0developed a machine that produces real, engine-ready gasoline from just air and water, powered by renewable electricity and advanced chemical processes.\u00a0The technology is based on direct air capture research, notably the work of physicist Klaus Lackner (shown on the left below), and is designed for easy installation in residential, commercial and industrial settings.",
      "The process begins by drawing in ambient air and using a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide to efficiently capture carbon dioxide. As air flows through a specially designed chamber, the liquid sorbent absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, which is then regenerated for repeated use. Next, the system uses renewable electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through electrolysis. The hydrogen is retained for the fuel synthesis process, while the oxygen is safely released into the environment.",
      "FLYING CAR WITH 620-MILE RANGE SCHEDULED FOR UPCOMING LAUNCH",
      "The captured carbon dioxide and generated hydrogen are then combined to create methanol, which is subsequently converted into gasoline using established chemical processes. The resulting gasoline contains no sulfur, ethanol or heavy metals, making it fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Each Aircela unit can produce approximately one gallon of gasoline per day from around 22 pounds of captured carbon dioxide with a storage capacity of up to 17 gallons. This innovative machine enables users to generate fossil-free gasoline on site using only air, water and renewable electricity.",
      "Physicist Klaus Lackner, at left, and Eric Dahlgren, co-founder and CEO of Aircela, at right\u00a0\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Distributed production sets Aircela apart",
      "Unlike traditional synthetic fuel projects that rely on large, centralized plants, Aircela's approach is modular and distributed. Each unit can produce gasoline on site, making it suitable for off-grid locations, ports, islands or emergency situations. This design allows users to access cleaner fuel without the need to alter their vehicles or fueling routines.",

      "Aircela has secured funding from notable investors, including Chris Larsen, founder of Ripple Labs' Jeff Ubben, a board member at ExxonMobil; and Maersk Growth, the venture capital arm of A.P. Moller-Maersk. During the demonstration, Morten Bo Christiansen, Maersk's head of energy transition, emphasized the machine's potential to support global efforts to reduce carbon emissions, particularly in the shipping and logistics industries.",
      "Aircela's air-to-gasoline machine\u00a0 (Aircela)",
      "Environmental and practical advantages",
      "The process developed by Aircela is intended to be carbon neutral, as the carbon dioxide released when the gasoline is burned is balanced by the amount captured during production. The gasoline works with current engines and fueling systems, so there is no need for costly upgrades. Distributed production reduces reliance on centralized refineries and long supply chains. In addition, the fuel's purity, free from sulfur and additives, helps lower harmful emissions beyond just carbon dioxide.",

The company's goal is to increase production, reduce costs and make the technology widely available. While the current output is modest, Aircela aims to provide a practical, climate-aligned alternative to fossil fuels that does not require people to change their vehicles or daily habits.",

      "Aircela's gasoline-from-air machine shows that sometimes the best solutions are the ones that fit right into our daily routines. Instead of requiring new cars or major changes, this technology lets people keep using what they already have, just with cleaner fuel. Watching carbon pulled from the air and turned into gasoline on the spot feels like a practical step toward a more sustainable future.",

      "I recommend a few ways to\u00a0delete your private information, including your home address, from such websites.",
      "1. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0Data brokers can sell your home address and other personal data to multiple businesses and individuals, so the key is to act fast.

They aren\u2019t cheap \u2014 and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web",
      "2. Opt out manually : Use a free scanner provided by a data removal service to check which people search sites that list your address. Then, visit each of these websites and look for an opt-out procedure or form: keywords like \"opt out,\" \"delete my information,\" etc., point the way.",
      "Follow each site\u2019s opt-out process carefully, and confirm they\u2019ve removed all your personal info, otherwise, it may get relisted.",
      "3. Monitor your digital footprint:\u00a0I recommend regularly searching online for your name to see if your location is publicly available. If only your social media profile pops up, there\u2019s no need to worry. However, people finder sites tend to relist your private information, including your home address, after some time.",
      "4. Limit sharing your address online:\u00a0Be careful about sharing your home address on social media, online forms and apps. Review privacy settings regularly, and only provide your address when absolutely necessary. Also, adjust your phone settings so that apps don\u2019t track your location.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your home address is more vulnerable than you think. People finder sites aggregate data from public records and private sources to display your address online, often without your knowledge or consent. This can lead to serious privacy and safety risks. Taking proactive steps to protect your home address is essential. Do it manually or use a data removal tool for an easier process. By understanding how your location is collected and taking measures to remove your address from online sites, you can reclaim control over your personal data.",

      "1. Don\u2019t overshare: Even with AI tools like ChatGPT",
      "AI chatbots like ChatGPT are useful, but they're not private journals. The platform owners may have privacy policies and use the latest security measures, but that doesn't mean you should let your guard down. When using these tools, refrain from sharing any personal information, such as your name, address, birthdate, passwords, financial details or sensitive conversations. Remember that AI systems store and process your inputs, and despite security promises, data breaches can occur.",
      "SCAMMERS CAN EXPLOIT YOUR DATA FROM JUST 1 CHATGPT SEARCH",
      "Tip: Treat all online forms of AI interaction like public forums. Keep your examples generic and use caution with anything that could identify you.",

      "CLEAN UP YOUR PHONE: SPEED, STORAGE AND PRIVACY BOOST IN MINUTES",
      "2. Use alias email addresses",
      "Your email is often the key to your online identity and a common target for spam. By creating disposable email aliases that forward messages to your main inbox, you can keep your real address hidden from websites and services. These unique aliases act as shields, so if one starts getting spammed or is involved in a data breach, you can simply deactivate it without affecting your main email account.",
      "My top recommendation to avoid being inundated with spam emails is\u00a0to use an alias email address. An alias email address is an additional email address that can be used to receive emails in the same mailbox as the primary email address. It acts as a forwarding address, directing emails to the primary email address.",
      "In addition to creating throwaway email accounts for online sign-ups and other circumstances where you would not want to disclose your primary email address, alias email addresses are helpful for handling and organizing incoming communications.",
      "Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about getting tons of spam mail or having your information taken in a data breach. An alias email address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address.\u00a0See my review of the best secure and private email services here.",

Use Facebook's\u00a0Privacy Checkup tool to review and adjust crucial settings, including post visibility, app permissions, search visibility and friend-request settings.

You bought a low-cost Android-based device from an unknown or no-name brand:\u00a0Devices sold online through third-party sellers or unknown brands, especially if advertised as \"unlocked,\" \"jailbroken\" or offering free streaming, are at higher risk. Models like the T95 box or other generic Android TV boxes are known carriers. Specifically, the following devices have been identified as impacted by BadBox malware:",
      "Device model: TV98, X96Q_Max_P, Q96L2, X96Q2, X96mini, S168, ums512_1h10_Natv, X96_S400, X96mini_RP, TX3mini, HY-001, MX10PRO, X96mini_Plus1, LongTV_GN7501E, Xtv77, NETBOX_B68, X96Q_PR01, AV-M9, ADT-3, OCBN, X96MATE_PLUS, KM1, X96Q_PRO, Projector_T6P, X96QPRO-TM, sp7731e_1h10_native, M8SPROW, TV008, X96Mini_5G, Q96MAX, Orbsmart_TR43, Z6, TVBOX, Smart, KM9PRO, A15, Transpeed, KM7, iSinbox, I96, SMART_TV, Fujicom-SmartTV, MXQ9PRO, MBOX, X96Q, isinbox, Mbox, R11, GameBox, KM6, X96Max_Plus2, TV007, Q9 Stick, SP7731E, H6, X88, X98K, TXCZ",
      "2. Your device is not Google-certified:\u00a0If your Android device doesn't support\u00a0Google Play Protect or doesn't show the\u00a0Play Protect certification in the Play Store settings, it's likely running on an uncertified version of Android. That's a major red flag. To check:",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.Tap your profile icon >\u00a0Settings >\u00a0About.Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",
      "Open the\u00a0Google Play Store.",

      "Look for\u00a0Play Protect certification. If it says\u00a0\"Device is not certified,\" that's a problem.",
      "3. Suspicious behavior or strange apps:\u00a0Look for unfamiliar apps you didn't install, apps labeled with foreign characters or alternative app stores on your device. BadBox-infected devices often come with shady apps preloaded.",
      "4. Google Play Protect is disabled:\u00a0If Play Protect has been turned off without your knowledge or is missing altogether, your device may be vulnerable to compromise.",
      "5. Your home internet is acting strange:\u00a0If your network is unusually slow or your router shows unknown devices connected, one of your smart devices may be hijacked and rerouting traffic as part of a residential proxy network.",
      "6. The device came with outdated or unofficial firmware:\u00a0If your device doesn't receive software updates or has a strange update process, that's another potential sign it's not legit or may be compromised.",

      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Protecting your devices starts with powerful antivirus protection.

A trusted antivirus app can help detect hidden threats, block malicious traffic and warn you about suspicious behavior that might otherwise go unnoticed. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Only buy certified and trusted devices:\u00a0Stick to devices certified by Google or other recognized platforms. Avoid generic or off-brand Android boxes, tablets and projectors, especially if they are advertised as unlocked or include free streaming. Cheap, uncertified devices are more likely to come with malware preinstalled.",
      "3. Avoid sideloading apps from unofficial sources:\u00a0Do not install apps from third-party app stores or download APK files from unknown websites. These files can contain hidden malware. Use only official app stores like the Google Play Store that scan apps for threats.",
      "4. Check your device settings for tampering:\u00a0Look for signs like Google Play Protect being turned off, the presence of unfamiliar app stores or suspicious apps running in the background. These are possible signs your device is compromised.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "5. Monitor your network for unusual activity:\u00a0If your internet slows down suddenly, or you notice unknown devices on your Wi-Fi, investigate. Use your router's settings or a network monitoring app to track strange behavior or unauthorized connections.",
      "6. Disconnect and replace suspicious hardware:\u00a0If a device is behaving oddly or was purchased from an untrusted source, unplug it from your network. Consider replacing it with a product from a reputable brand and a verified seller.",
      "7. Keep your devices and apps updated:\u00a0Install system and app updates regularly. Even though cheap devices may not always offer updates,\u00a0keeping your software current reduces your risk. Choose brands that are known for providing reliable security patches.",
      "8. Secure your router and home network:\u00a0Your devices are only as safe as the network they're connected to. Set a strong, unique password for your Wi-Fi router and update its firmware regularly. Disable remote access unless absolutely necessary and use WPA3 encryption if available. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",

      "It's alarming how something as simple as a budget streaming box or projector could be quietly working for cybercriminals.

      "One of the most noticeable changes this year is Apple\u2019s decision to unify the naming across all its platforms. Instead of traditional version numbers, Apple is now using the year after release as the version name. So the new names are iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26.

      "Atom Bodies' flagship product, Atom Touch, is setting a new standard in prosthetic arms. Unlike traditional prosthetics, which often offer only basic movement and can be uncomfortable to wear, Atom Touch uses EMG (electromyography) sensors placed on the user's skin to detect muscle activity. These signals are then interpreted by machine-learning algorithms, allowing users to control individual fingers, the wrist and the elbow with remarkable precision just by thinking about the movement they want to make.",

It is the first prosthetic arm to offer true individual finger movement, which means users can perform tasks like typing, gripping and delicate manipulation with much greater ease. The device uses the Atom A1 AI neural interface, which learns from the user's muscle signals to provide seamless, natural movement. Dozens of sensors in the hand generate haptic feedback, so users can better gauge grip strength and control. With more than 10 motors in the hand alone, Atom Touch offers a near-human range of motion and dexterity. The load-balanced harness system also makes the arm lighter than a human arm and comfortable enough for extended wear, addressing a challenge that many current prosthetics have yet to solve.",

      "\"Importantly, peaceful protesters who exercise their First Amendment rights without violence are not subject to terrorism investigations or charges. The term is only applied when criminal acts cross the line into ideologically driven violence,\" Pack said.",

The following day, at least 25 people were killed and more than 600 were wounded when walkie-talkies were detonated in the region.",

    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 07:00:37 -0400",
    "summary": "Security experts suggest private contractors could break Hamas&apos; control over Gaza by managing aid distribution and training local Palestinian security forces.",
    "story": [
      "A group of foreign policy and security experts have compiled a report looking at a solution for a \"day after\" plan in Gaza, and believe private security contractors, which have heavy experience in the Mideast could be a solution to replace Hamas.",
      "The question of a \"day after\" plan in the Gaza Strip has plagued negotiations between Israel, the U.S., Arab nations and Hamas for months and has ultimately led to the terrorist network\u2019s refusal to release the 55 hostages still held there.",
      "However, foreign policy leaders and security experts based in Washington may have the key that could provide a solution to help rebuild the war-torn Gaza Strip where others cannot: private security contractors (PSC).",
      "PSCs, which have heavy experience in the Middle East and decades of lessons learned to draw from, could be used as non-state actors to provide stability and a path forward for the Palestinians, but they would have to start with humanitarian aid, John Hannah, former national security advisor to Dick Cheney and current Randi & Charles Wax senior fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), told Fox News Digital.",
      "Palestinians continue their daily lives under harsh conditions amid the rubble of destroyed buildings in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza following the enforcement of a ceasefire agreement on Feb. 10, 2025. (Mahmoud ssa/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "ISRAEL OBJECTS TO FOREIGN NATIONS SANCTIONING ITS OFFICIALS",
      "In a plan hatched out following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent outbreak of war in the Gaza Strip, a group of eight members with JINSA and the Vandenberg Coalition comprised a report that detailed how the handling of humanitarian aid could completely change security in the region.",
      "The plan, in part, initially looked similar to the mechanism known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which is backed by the U.S. and Israel, and which launched last month to distribute aid to Palestinians.",
      "However, the plan comprised by Hannah and the team took it a step further and argued that these aid actors should also be involved in rebuilding Gaza.",
      "\"We thought humanitarian issues was the best way [forward],\" Hannah said.\u00a0\"It was the common denominator that would allow all of the major stakeholders that want to get to a better \u2018day after\u2019 \u2013 Israel, the United States, the key pragmatic Arab states \u2013 they all could agree that we can't agree on a political vision for Palestine 10 years from now, and the issue of a Palestinian state, but we can all agree on this apple pie and motherhood issue that we don't want to see starving, suffering Palestinians.\"",
      "Hamas terrorists emerge in a show of strength, escorting Red Cross vehicles carrying three Israeli hostages to be released as part of the ceasefire deal. (TPS-IL)",
      "The Israel Defense Forces had already detailed the need to eliminate Hamas following the deadliest-ever attack on Israel, but the group of eight experts also identified that aid, long used by Hamas to maintain power by using it to incentivize support and recruitment, and to punish opposition, needed to be the key to cementing actual change.",
      "\"We needed a solution on humanitarian aid,\" Hannah said. \"And when we looked around the world, who could do this, take over the humanitarian aid? We were left with one option.\"",

      "\"We didn't think it should be the Israel Defense Forces. Israel lacks legitimacy with the Palestinian population, and frankly, it had its hands full doing the military job of defeating Hamas,\" he added. \u00a0\"American forces weren't going to do it. We didn't think Arab forces would step up and do this. And the U.N. system as it existed under UNRWA was illegitimate in the eyes of Israel.\"",
      "The group not only briefed the Biden and Netanyahu administrations on the proposal, but held numerous discussions with Israeli officials in 2024 on how such a plan could work.",
      "Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Michael Barbero \u2013 who served as deputy chief of staff, Strategic Operations for Multinational Forces-Iraq for 2007-2008 and who was tasked by Gen. David Petraeus to create a system of accountability over PSCs in Iraq following the Blackwater incident in September 2007 known as the Nisour Square massacre \u2013 also briefed Israeli officials on how a PSC mechanism could work in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Progress on the proposal appeared to stall by summer last year as then-President Joe Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu were at increasing loggerheads over humanitarian concerns and mounting civilian Palestinian death tolls.",
      "However, Hannah questioned whether the seed had been planted with Israel by the time the Trump administration re-entered office, enabling the GHF to come in and start distributing aid.",
      "The GHF, though it has distributed over 16 million meals since it began operations in late May, saw a chaotic start with starving Palestinians rushing certain sites and reports of violence unfolding.",

      "THERE'S A WAY TO AID GAZA. I KNOW, MY FOUNDATION JUST HELPED DELIVER 7 MILLION MEALS... WITHOUT INCIDENT",
      "Though the reports of the level of chaos have reportedly been exaggerated by Hamas \u2013 which ultimately would benefit from the GHF\u2019s failure as experts have explained \u2013 the group initially drew some criticism over transparency concerns, though the group has been looking to remedy this with regal updates.",
      "The group, which saw its third leadership in as many weeks earlier this month, told Fox News Digital that despite some frustration among world leaders and aid groups, its goal is to work with major organizations like the United Nations and others to better distribute aid across Gaza where those programs are still flagging.",

      "Palestinians in Gaza get aid from the U.S. and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation)",
      "Though while Washington backs the effort, State Department spokeperson Tammy Bruce has repeatedly made clear that the GHF is \"an independent organization\" that \"does not receive U.S. government funding.\"",
      "However, she has also refused to confirm whether any U.S. officials are working for the program.",
      "PSCs have a storied history in the Middle East, and not only the U.S. war on terror. They have been used by nations like Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which could lend them a level of acceptance that would not be attainable by another force.",
      "The proposal issued by Hannah and his colleagues took the use of PSCs one step beyond humanitarian aid and argued they could make a positive impact in the actual reconstruction of the Gaza Strip \u2013 an idea that was also presented to the Trump administration this year.",
      "Displaced Palestinians wait to receive a free meal from a charity food distribution center in Gaza City, northern Gaza, on Tuesday, May 27, 2025. (Photographer: Ahmad Salem/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "\"It's not at all foreign to these Arab parties that you might employ PSCs for certain critical missions,\" Hannah said. \"Our idea was, let's scale it up. Let's unify the effort. Let's have America and the Arabs lead it.",
      "\"The Arabs would put in most of the humanitarian aid workers, a lot of the financing, and then they would hire some of these international PSCs with a lot of experience to come in and protect those operations,\" he explained. \"You'd have the Arabs engaged, which we thought was absolutely critical.\"",
      "The plan also included bringing in other international aid organizations that would work with these PSCs to expand developments like housing projects, community development and infrastructure repair to restore electricity and water.",
      "\"And eventually, hopefully, begin to identify new leadership, local leadership in Gaza, who would be prepared to cooperate with the operations of this nonprofit entity,\" Hannah said. \"Local Gazans of goodwill, who wanted to be rid of Hamas, who this entity could provide some support to, some protection to so they can, could begin rebuilding Gaza civil administration.\"",

      "The plan also addressed the perpetual question of how to deter the next generation of Hamas terrroirsts, particularly amid Israeli military operations.",
      "Hannah argued this issue could be addressed by simultaneously training a \"non-Hamas new Palestinian, local Palestinian security force\" that would not only have the trust of the local population but could also gain the trust of Israel.",
      "Hannah said he still believes this plan could be a tenable next step to securing the Gaza Strip but urged the Trump administration to take a more direct diplomatic role by leaning on Arab, European and Israeli partners to make it happen.",

      "Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus, former IDF Spokesperson, Senior Fellow at FDD and Co-Founder of \"BottomLine Media\" spoke with Fox News Digital after Israel launched its historic Operation Rising Lion.",
      "Israel\u2019s preemptive attack on Iran not only marked a major milestone for the 77-year-old nation, but also a turning point for the Middle East. According to a former IDF spokesperson, as Jerusalem grapples with the ongoing war in Gaza, it\u2019s clear Israel has its eyes set on one major goal: ensuring that Tehran never obtains a nuclear weapon.",
      "Lt. Col. (Ret.) Jonathan Conricus, former IDF Spokesperson, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) and co-founder of \"BottomLine Media,\" told Fox News Digital that Israel is working to eradicate what it sees as an existential threat.",
      "In the early hours of Friday morning local time, Israel carried out a series of airstrikes and covert operations to take out Iranian infrastructure and senior leadership. The IDF on Saturday said it had killed more than 20 Iranian commanders, including the head of the country\u2019s Intelligence Directorate and the commander of Iran\u2019s surface-to-surface missile array.",

      "\"To be frank, a nuclear program like that means it's personnel before it is infrastructure. And if we're serious about it \u2014 to have a meaningful lasting impact on the Iranian nuclear weapons program means that Israel has to work quite long and quite hard and it means a lot of knowledge has to be deleted,\" Conricus said.",
      "While Iran\u2019s infrastructure and leadership have taken major hits in Israel\u2019s Operation Rising Lion, Tehran\u2019s influence over the Middle East, including its proxies, has been damaged. Conricus told Fox News Digital that the crumbling of what he calls \"Iran\u2019s ring of fire around Israel\" began with Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7 massacres.",

      "\"It's not totally done yet, but Hamas and Hezbollah are very weak compared to what they were on October the 7th, and Iran itself is, I think, the weakest that I've ever seen it, militarily and politically,\" Conricus said.",
      "\"So, I think that with the benefit of hindsight, Iranian strategic planners, when they were thinking about this multi-front assault on Israel from Gaza, from Lebanon, from Syria, maybe from other places, and they had these pipe dreams that that would somehow eradicate the State of Israel \u2014 with the benefits of hindsight \u2014 may not have been such a brilliant idea.\"",

Following Israel\u2019s attacks, several countries, including France and the U.K., reaffirmed their opposition to Tehran gaining a nuclear weapon, even while criticizing Jerusalem for its operation.",
      "\"Many countries behind the scenes are very positive and cheering on Israel and even sending messages of support and wishing us the best of luck against the Iranians because it would suit their strategic goals, and they're happy that someone is standing up to the regional bully, which is Iran,\" Conricus said.",

      "\"Before you know, 48 hours ago, I think if the Iranians threatened people then the level of fear and deterrence would have been reasonably high. Today, after the very humiliating defeats that the Iranians have suffered at the hands of Mossad and Israeli Air Force and special forces, I'm quite confident that Iranian deterrence has taken quite a significant hit and that the countries who perhaps before were very much deterred by the Iranians probably are less so today,\" Conricus told Fox News Digital.",
      "However, he noted that those countries still have an opportunity to assert themselves.",
      "Conricus also believes that while \"it\u2019s too early in the game\" to predict what this could mean for Iran domestically, there is a chance that the Iranian regime could be at stake. The country was already dealing with internal unrest prior to Israel\u2019s attack as the population revolted against the regime\u2019s quashing of basic rights and freedoms.",

Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, and wounding another state legislator and his wife had \u201cstalked his victims like prey\u201d before opening fire at their homes, elaborately disguised as a law enforcement officer, prosecutors said Monday.",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, was allegedly wearing a \u201chyper realistic\u201d silicone face mask, a tactical vest and body armor when he arrived at the Champlin home of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, early Saturday, according to Joseph Thompson, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Minnesota.",
      "Wielding a flashlight and a handgun, Boelter allegedly knocked on the Hoffmans\u2019 door around 2 a.m. and shouted, \u201cThis is the police! Open the door!\u201d",
      "His black SUV had emergency lights and a license plate that read \u201cpolice,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "The couple answered the door together, the prosecutor said at a news conference. He said Boelter shined his flashlight in their faces, said there had been a shooting reported in the house and asked them if they had weapons.",
      "When Boelter lowered his flashlight, the couple shouted that he was not a police officer. Prosecutors said Boelter then announced \u201cthis is a robbery\u201d and tried to force himself into their home.",
      "Hoffman tried to push Boelter out of his home, but the suspect shot him and his wife repeatedly before fleeing to his next target's  home, Thompson said.",
      "The Hoffmans\u2019 daughter called 911. The couple were severely injured and remained hospitalized.",
      "Meanwhile, Boelter continued on his alleged rampage, which he appeared to have plotted for \u201cquite some time,\u201d though it\u2019s still unclear why, officials said.",
      "Authorities said there were more than 45 names of state and federal elected officials in multiple notebooks found in the suspect\u2019s SUV and home.",
      "\u201cBoelter planned his attack carefully,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cHe researched his victims and their families. He used the internet and other tools to find their addresses and names, the names of the family members. He conducted surveillance of their homes and took notes of the location of their homes.\u201d",
      "In a statement shared Monday evening, the Hortmans\u2019 adult children, Sophie and Colin Hortman, said they were safe, with loved ones and grateful for the support and privacy they\u2019ve received.",

      "Boelter rushed into their home through the front door and repeatedly opened fire, killing the couple, Thompson said. The suspect fled out the back door, dropping his mask and body armor on the way, Thompson said.",
      "He called the alleged crimes \u201cthe stuff of nightmares.\u201d",
      "After the attacks, Boelter allegedly texted his family: \u201cDad went to war last night\u2026 I don\u2019t wanna implicate anybody,\u201d according to an affidavit.",
      "In a message to his wife, Boelter apologized and appeared to warn her about an incoming police presence, the affidavit said. \u201cWords are not gonna explain how sorry I am for the situation,\u201d the text read. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger-happy and I don\u2019t want you guys around.\u201d",
      "Police searched his wife\u2019s car and recovered two guns, $10,000 in cash and passports for her two children, who were in the car at the time of the search, according to court records.",
      "After a two-day manhunt, which was the state's biggest, the suspect was found crawling in a field Sunday night, authorities said.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The targeted shootings of two Minnesota state lawmakers has renewed an urgent debate on Capitol Hill as members of Congress raise alarm bells about their safety amid escalating political rhetoric and violent threats.",
      "Law enforcement officials have begun holding a series of security briefings with groups of congressional lawmakers that will continue into Tuesday. Lawmakers have been told that they can spend money from their office budgets on home security systems and campaign cash on private security. Only a handful of congressional leaders get 24-hour protection from Capitol Police security details, though members can request extra protection, which is assigned based on whether Capitol Police determine there is an active threat.",
      "But so far, those assurances have done little to calm nervous lawmakers, who have been harboring such concerns amid a string of violent attacks on American politicians over the past 15 years \u2014 a period that has included assassination attempts on a presidential candidate and members of Congress and a riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s scary as sh--,\u201d a senior House lawmaker said, describing how members of Congress feel after the Minnesota shootings. \u201cWe have had new safety and security procedures in place since Jan. 6, 2021. They include coordinating my district travel with local law enforcement. We will review those in light of the assassination in Minnesota.\u201d",
      "Authorities said Monday that the suspect, Vance Boelter, visited the homes of four elected officials early Saturday impersonating a police officer. Authorities say he shot and killed state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, shortly after he seriously wounded state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife in a separate shooting at their home. He was arrested Sunday night.",
      "A lengthy list of names of Democratic officials found in Boelter\u2019s vehicle included those of several members of Congress, such as Sens. Tina Smith of Minnesota and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Reps. Angie Craig of Minnesota, Debbie Dingell of Michigan and Greg Landsman of Ohio.",
      "\u201cBoth with the president and his administration and with members of Congress ... we need to bring the temperature down,\u201d Baldwin told reporters in the Capitol on Monday night. \u201cThere\u2019s no place for political violence ever. Words matter.\u201d",
      "Rep. Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., said Monday that she was canceling a town hall Monday evening after she learned her name was also on the suspect\u2019s list.",
      "\u201cOpen, honest dialogue with West Michigan is at the heart of my service\u2013and I will not be deterred from standing up for this community,\u201d Scholten said in a statement. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and to not divert additional law enforcement resources away from protecting the broader public at this time, this is the responsible choice.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers press congressional leaders about security",
      "After the Minnesota shootings, House Democratic leaders pressed their Republican counterparts Monday to do more to protect members of Congress.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and Rep. Joe Morelle, D.N.Y., the ranking member of the House Administration Committee, asked Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., to boost House members\u2019 official budgets \u201cto support additional safety and security measures in every single office.\u201d",
      "Some members of Congress have complained that there isn\u2019t enough money in the office budgets to go around and that spending it on security can take away from other critical needs. To raise the budget for offices, Congress would need to approve an increase in the annual legislative branch appropriations bill.",
      "\u201cWhile we differ in many areas related to policy and our vision for America\u2019s future, Member safety must be an area of common ground,\u201d Jeffries and Morelle wrote in a letter. \u201cRepresentatives from both sides of the aisle have endured assassination attempts that changed their lives and careers forever. Too many other patriotic public servants have left Congress because they no longer felt safe carrying out their duty as elected officials.\u201d",
      "In response to the attempt to assassinate U.S. District Judge Esther Salas of New Jersey in 2020, Congress passed a bill in 2022 to protect judges\u2019 personally identifiable information and allow them to redact personal information in certain cases online.",
      "In the wake of the Minnesota shootings, lawmakers have renewed discussions about passing a bill that would give themselves the same protections, according to a source with knowledge of the talks.",
      "\u201cI have long advocated for data privacy for everyone, including the residences of lawmakers, and I have encountered resistance in the past,\u201d Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said in a statement. \u201cMaybe these horrific murders will change the sentiment within Congress.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, House Republicans held an hourlong virtual call with House Sergeant at Arms William McFarland and Capitol Police leaders to discuss security concerns.",
      "The call got tense, according to two members who were on it. Ten to 15 lawmakers spoke up, expressing concerns about their safety, particularly when they go home to their districts.",
      "A Republican lawmaker told NBC News the call was \u201cterrible,\u201d adding that leaders have detail protection but that \u201cnothing has changed\u201d for other members, despite concerns about security before the Minnesota shootings.",
      "Another source said the call, which happened to take place on the eighth anniversary of the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in 2017, was almost entirely about lawmakers\u2019 needing police protection at their homes and concerns that their personal information is so readily available.",
      "McFarland walked through some of the security options that are allowed for members. And leadership assured members that further avenues will be explored to see whether more can be done to protect lawmakers at home.",
      "House Democrats are expected to hold a similar virtual briefing on security Tuesday. Senators will have an in-person briefing Tuesday, as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been worried about lawmaker security for quite a while. People are just getting more and more brazen all the time,\u201d said Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., who said his first cousin lives \u201ctwo doors down\u201d from the shooting in Champlin, Minnesota. \u201cIt\u2019s too close to home. It\u2019s so sad.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverybody in my family, you end up putting your head on a swivel, and you hate to live that way,\u201d he added.",
      "Elected officials face growing threats",
      "Threats to lawmakers have been steadily rising in recent years. Last year, the Capitol Police Threat Assessment Section investigated 9,474 concerning statements and direct threats against the members of Congress, their families or their staff members, an 18% increase from the previous year. The only year when more threats were recorded was 2021, in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, when police investigated 9,625 threats.",
      "On Monday, a 25-year-old Georgia man was arraigned on federal charges of making violent threats against Sens. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Deb Fischer, R-Neb., the Justice Department said.",
      "But providing around-the-clock protection for all 535 members of Congress would be financially and logistically impractical. And Capitol Police have struggled to recruit and retain officers, even before the Jan. 6 attack, though in recent years the department has launched an aggressive recruitment effort.",
      "Instead, officials have pointed to security resources already available to lawmakers. After the Jan. 6 riot, the House sergeant at arms created a program allowing each member to use up to $10,000 to install and maintain security systems at their homes.",
      "And given threats on the campaign trail, the Federal Election Commission recently began allowing House and Senate candidates to spend campaign funds on security, including private security guards, cybersecurity and home security systems.",
      "During the 2024 election cycle, House and Senate candidates spent $8.5 million on security-related expenses, according to an NBC News review of FEC statements. That\u2019s an increase from the more than $7.5 million congressional campaigns spent in the 2022 cycle. Former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., led all senators, spending more than $1.2 million on such security expenses, while Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., led House members by spending $432,241.",
      "There have been several high-profile examples of political leaders who have been targeted for attack in recent years.",
      "In January 2011, Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., was shot in the head while she was meeting with constituents at a Tucson grocery store. Giffords survived, but six of the 18 other people wounded in the shooting died.",
      "In June 2017, a gunman opened fire on Republicans as they practiced in Alexandria, Virginia, for the annual congressional baseball charity game. Four people were shot, including Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., then the House majority whip, who nearly died.",
      "Members of the House and the Senate, along with Vice President Mike Pence, were targeted by pro-Donald Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in a bid to overturn the results of the 2020 election.",
      "In October 2022, a man broke into the San Francisco home of Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then the House speaker, and attacked her husband with a hammer. The man was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",
      "And last July, just months before the presidential election, Trump narrowly survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally after a gunman fired multiple rounds and struck his ear. Trump survived another attempt on his life in September while he was golfing in Florida.",
      "\"It clearly looks like a political assassination, and there's just no room for that in this country,\" GOP Sen. Eric Schmitt, the former attorney general of Missouri, said of the Minnesota shooting. \"I think it's a moment for the country to take a step back and everybody to condemn it.\""

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has reopened arrests of  immigrant workers at hotels, restaurants and agricultural businesses, backtracking on the brief reprieve they got after President Donald Trump stated they were necessary, good, longtime workers whose jobs were almost \"impossible\" to replace.",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary in the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement Tuesday \"there will be no safe spaces for industries who harbor violent criminals or purposely try to undermine ICE's efforts.\"",
      "Worksite enforcement \"remains a cornerstone\" of its immigration enforcement efforts, which McLaughlin said \"target illegal employment networks that undermine American workers, destabilize labor markets and expose critical infrastructure to exploitation.\u201d",
      "The announcement backpedals on Trump's statement last week on social media that \"changes are coming\" after farmers and hotel and leisure business employers had complained that \"our very aggressive policy on immigration is taking very good, long time workers away from them, with those jobs being almost impossible to replace.\"",
      "Just six days ago, Immigration and Customs Enforcement paused arrests at worksites in agriculture industries, including fisheries and meatpacking plants, restaurants and hotels, according to an internal policy memo obtained by NBC News last Thursday.",
      "\u201cEffective today, hold on all worksite enforcement investigations/ operations on agriculture (including aquaculture and meat packing plants), restaurants, and operating hotels,\u201d said the memo from Tatum King, Homeland Security Investigations special agent in charge of the San Francisco field office.",
      "But by Tuesday morning, the White house was contradicting that position, saying \"anyone present in the United States illegally is at risk of deportation.\"",
      "The field memo that announced the pause had noted that it would be difficult for ICE to maintain a monthly arrest quota of 3,000 that the administration had directed field offices to achieve.",
      "\u201cWe acknowledge that by taking this off the table, that we are eliminating a significant # of potential targets,\u201d King wrote.",
      "Asked about the change during a gaggle with reporters aboard Air Force One on his return from the G7 summit, Trump said: \"We're going to look everywhere. But I think the biggest problem is the inner cities.\" He repeated campaign rhetoric, blaming former President Joe Biden and saying he let prisoners, gang members, drug dealers and the \"mentally insane\" into the country.",
      "Trump said cities are where \"the really bad ones are, the murderers.\"",
      "\"We're going to get them out,\" Trump said. \"There are for more in the inner cities, Democrat-run cities, sadly, and I'm just giving you, there's far more in there than you have on a farm or someplace.\""

      "\"Why would I call him? I could call and say, \u2018Hi, how you doing?\u2019 The guy doesn\u2019t have a clue,\" Trump said, referring to Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., who was the vice presidential contender facing off against Trump's ticket in 2024. \"He\u2019s a mess. So I could be nice and call, but why waste time?\"",
      "Presidents have historically called state and local politicians on both sides of the aisle to lend their support in the aftermath of violent tragedies like natural disasters or high-profile shootings.",

He criticized Walz for his response to the 2020 protests after the murder of George Floyd \u2014 claiming on social media that Walz \"let rioters and looters burn down Minneapolis\" \u2014  though NBC News has previously reported that he has privately praised the governor\u2019s response.",

On his first day in office, Trump pardoned about 1,500 people charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. The pardon did not make an exception for people who assaulted law enforcement officers.",

      "Only this time, Thunder forward Jalen Williams stood in the way.",
      "After the Pacers cut the score to 95-93, the Thunder went on a 16-4 run over the next two minutes and 55 seconds, pushing its lead to 14 before winning 120-109. And during that decisive stretch, Williams scored eight of his team-leading 11 fourth-quarter points, keeping Indiana at bay and leading the Thunder to within one win of a championship.",
      "\u201cGreat force,\u201d Oklahoma City coach Mark Daigneault said when asked to describe what he saw from Williams in Game 5. \u201cThat was an unbelievable performance by him, just throughout the whole game. He really was on the gas the entire night. Applied a ton of pressure.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe was, like, really gutsy tonight,\u201d said Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the regular-season MVP. \u201cHe stepped into big plays. Felt like every time we needed a shot, he made it. He wasn\u2019t afraid. He was fearless tonight.\u201d",
      "Williams finished with a playoff career-high 40 points, along with six rebounds and four assists. He shot 14-of-25 from the field, including 3-of-5 from deep. Only 24 years old, Williams became the fifth-youngest player to score at least 40 points in an NBA Finals game, and it couldn\u2019t have come at a more crucial moment for the Thunder.",
      "\u201cA lot of the things that [Williams] got in the game tonight are things we talked about earlier in the season,\u201d Daigneault said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t having games like this in November, December. His focus on the improvement led him to being the player he is right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn order to get better and being good in these moments \u2014 and by no means am I perfect in these moments \u2014 you\u2019re able to generate good habits when you have the right way of going about it and you have a process,\u201d Williams said. \u201cI\u2019m extremely fortunate that I have a coach and a staff and teammates that allow me to have those ugly plays during the year and figure out my game.\u201d",
      "Oklahoma City needed Williams to improve not only from earlier in the season, but from earlier in the playoffs as well. While on the whole his postseason has impressed, Williams has had some struggles in big moments.",
      "In a Game 1 loss to the Denver Nuggets in the second round, Williams scored only 16 points on 5-of-20 shooting. Later that series, in a Game 6 defeat, he shot 3-of-16 for only 6 points.",
      "Through the first two games of the finals, Williams was averaging only 18 points on 33.3% shooting \u2014 but he finally broke out with 26 in Game 3. Since then, his improvement seems to have crystallized.",
      "Over the last two games, Williams has been asked to handle the ball more in the wake of full-court pressure on Gilgeous-Alexander, and he\u2019s responded with his two best scoring games of the championship round, dropping 27 last Friday before his 40-piece on Monday.",
      "The Game 5 performance, especially, is not one Williams expected so soon in his career.",
      "\u201cTo understand the opportunity that we have I just try to play as hard as I can,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever happens after that is where the chips fall.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019d be lying if I said I could imagine doing what I did tonight. I definitely could have seen myself here a long time ago, I just didn\u2019t think it would happen this fast and I didn\u2019t think it would be with a group of guys that I truly am grateful to be around.\u201d",

Kraft Heinz brands that sell products with these dyes include Crystal Light, Kool-Aid, MiO, Jell-O and Jet-Puffed, according to a Kraft Heinz spokesperson.",

It is unclear how removing the dyes will affect the company\u2019s business, as consumers could perceive the products as healthier but also may be less drawn to duller colors.",

      "A spokesperson for Kraft Heinz said on Tuesday that the company looks forward to partnering with the administration \u201cto provide quality, affordable, and wholesome food for all.\u201d",
      "Momentum against food dyes had been building for years. In January, before President Donald Trump and Kennedy took office, the FDA announced a ban on the use of Red No. 3 dye in food and ingested drugs. The dye gives many candies and cereals their bright red color, but is also known to cause cancer in laboratory animals. The FDA allowed Red No. 3 to be used by food manufacturers for years, though the state of California had already banned the dye in 2023.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in the release Tuesday that it has made more than 1,000 recipe changes over the past five years to improve product nutrition.",

      "Former Sen. Bob Menendez turned himself in Tuesday at a federal prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving an 11-year sentence on bribery charges.",
      "An attorney for Menendez, 71, has called the punishment a \"life and death sentence\" given his age, and the senator has tried unsuccessfully to get a pardon or commutation from then-President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump.",
      "The Democrat, once the senior senator from New Jersey and the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was found guilty in July of taking part in a bribery scheme that rewarded him and his wife Nadine Menendez with hundreds of thousands of dollars in gold bars and stacks of cash.",
      "Prosecutors alleged Menendez took the payoffs from some New Jersey businessmen in exchange for the senator's taking actions to benefit them and the governments of Egypt and Qatar.",
      "The bribes included gold bars, a Mercedes-Benz given to Nadine Menendez and more than $480,000 in cash, which the FBI found stuffed into closets, jackets bearing Menendez\u2019s name and other clothing when it searched his New Jersey home in 2022.",
      "He was convicted of extortion, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and acting as a foreign agent.",
      "Nadine Menendez was convicted in a separate trial and is scheduled to be sentenced in September. Her trial had been pushed back to allow her time to undergo cancer treatments. Her husband had been allowed to delay the date he had to surrender to prison in order to support her during her trial.",
      "Menendez had also asked an appeals court to let him remain free while he appeals his conviction, a request that was rejected by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last week.",
      "Allies of Menendez have made multiple overtures to Trump to secure a pardon or a commutation of his sentence, NBC News has previously reported, but to no avail so far. Trump has granted a number of pardons in public corruption cases since taking office in January, but they have gone to people who have supported him.",
      "Menendez was an outspoken critic of Trump during the president's first term, and voted against him in both of his impeachment trials.",
      "In the months since his conviction, Menendez has adopted some of the language Trump used when he was being prosecuted by the Justice Department, saying he's the victim of a political \"witch hunt\" and \"weaponization\" at the DOJ.",
      "He will serve his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution, Schuylkill. The facility is a medium-security prison with an adjacent minimum-security camp."

      "\u201cTurned the United Center into Cafe Disco,\u201d the official Northwestern University Instagram also captioned their post. \u201cThank you to Steve Carell for his #NU2025 Commencement address\u2014complete with a mid-speech dance break!\u201d",
      "Carell, according to Northwestern, centered his speech on kindness.",
      "\u201cKindness isn\u2019t a weakness. It is a very potent strength,\u201d he said, later adding, \u201cI embody a base line human decency, which, I believe, should not be celebrated, but expected. Everyone should be at very least, \u2018pretty nice.\u2019\u201d",
      "Carell received an honorary degree of Doctor of Arts from Northwestern. While he did not go to Northwestern himself, he touched on learning improv from the school's summer high school theater program.",
      "\u201cI was a \u2018Cherub\u2019 in the Northwestern Summer High School Institute for Theatre, and it was there that I was first introduced to improvisation, when several Northwestern students gave us a master class. That inspired me to later move to Chicago and to pursue a career at The Second City,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cAn improv scene goes nowhere unless everyone listens to one another. The best way to see and understand another human being is to listen to them. To listen is to show respect.\u201d",

    "summary": "Sabrina Carpenter's new album cover for her next project, \"Man's Best Friend\" is causing a lot of confusion amongst fans.",
    "story": [
      "What message is the cover art for Sabrina Carpenter's upcoming album, \"Man's Best Friend,\" sending, both artistically and for her brand?",
      "The singer's fans have been asking themselves just that since the art was released June 11, sparking conversation and controversy.",
      "Carpenter even replied to a person who questioned her personality and cover art choices.",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is the first follow-up to Carpenter's 2024 album \"Short 'n' Sweet\" that launched her to new heights of fame with songs like \"Espresso\" and \"Please Please Please.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "What is the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "The cover art is immediately provocative. In the photo, Carpenter kneels on all fours wearing a tight black dress. Her hand rests on a man's leg. His hand, meanwhile, holds a chunk of her blond hair. Carpenter stares at the camera with an open-mouthed expression.",
      "On Instagram, Carpenter shared another image: A closeup of a dog wearing a collar with the words \"Man's Best Friend.\"",
      "She captioned the post, \"My new album, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend' \ud83d\udc3e is out on August 29, 2025. I can\u2019t wait for it to be yours x Pre-order now.\"",
      "What are fans saying about the art?",
      "The art has gotten mixed reactions from fans, as evidenced by the comments on the original post and multiple Reddit threads.",
      "In the comments of Carpenter's post, people used words like \"disgusting\" and \"disturbing\" to describe the imagery, saying it was \"not a very empowering image for women.\" Another told her to \"please please please stand UP.\"",
      "Others tried to read into the image's connection to the album's title and found a deeper meaning.",
      "\"Man\u2019s best friend double meaning for dogs and female dogs are b---hes so it\u2019s a play on the ideology of men being so dependent on women,\" one commenter said. \"Her cover shows her being in a submissive role but in reality she\u2019s the one who has actual control.\"",
      "Commenters debated back-and-forth. One said they were getting \"secondhand embarrassment\" by looking at the picture. Another responded, \"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s to embarrass women but rather to show how women are regarded by certain men.\"",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Carpenter's reps for comment and has not heard back at the time of publication.",
      "What is Sabrina Carpenter trying to say? A PR expert breaks it down",
      "Beth Booker, public perception expert and creator of \"The Uncensored Publicist,\" says the artwork should be situated within Carpenter's own brand and the way female pop stars are often marketed.",
      "The image is a familiar one at first: A \u201cfemale pop star posed and packaged perfectly for the male gaze,\" Booker says, comparing it to Britney Spears in the early 2000s or Madonna's \"Like a Virgin\" era.",
      "However, Booker sees this as Carpenter \"flipping the script\" on a familiar format. Since humor is such a \"huge part of her brand,\" she says this should be interpreted with a wink.",
      "\"The cover is hypersexualized, yes, but intentionally exaggerated to feel almost absurd,\" she says. \"She\u2019s sexy, but she\u2019s also funny, self-aware, and in complete control of how she\u2019s being seen.\"",
      "Booker says that Carpenter's submissive posture in the photo is not an indication she's like that in real life.",
      "\"She\u2019s not performing desire for someone else\u2019s approval, she\u2019s expressing it for herself and her audience. The title, 'Man\u2019s Best Friend,' directly nods to how women have been labeled 'b-----s' for decades and she\u2019s essentially saying: fine, I\u2019ll take the word, flip it, and turn it into part of my brand,\" Booker says.",
      "Fans are debating Carpenter's intentions, which Booker says may have been Carpenter's intention.",
      "\"That confusion is the point. Great pop culture lives in that gray area where people aren\u2019t quite sure how they\u2019re supposed to feel. Is it satire? Is it sexy? The answer is yes. She knows exactly how this image would land and she\u2019s allowing people to sit in that tension because that\u2019s what keeps the conversation going. She\u2019s not being provocative accidentally, she\u2019s doing it on her own terms,\" she says.",
      "\u201cThe fact that some people, even some of her own fans, are uncomfortable with it actually reinforces the point. Brand evolution doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable in real time, and that\u2019s part of what makes this moment important for her career.\u201d",
      "\"Man's Best Friend\" is Carpenter's seventh studio album and it'll follow the release of \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet,\u201d her sixth studio album, which won pop album of the year at the 2025 Grammys.",
      "What did Sabrina Carpenter say about the cover art for 'Man's Best Friend'?",
      "Days after Carpenter unveiled the cover art for \"Man's Best Friend,\" her upcoming album, she replied to someone questioning the photo.",
      "A X user commented, \u201cDoes she have a personality outside of sex?\u201d reposting the cover art.",
      "On June 16, Carpenter commented, \u201cgirl yes and it is goooooood.\u201d"

      "Wilson explains that while she herself would \u201coften eat a lot of junk food,\u201d parents would \u201cnever deliberately feed your child rubbish.\u201d And avoiding feeding her child \"rubbish\" is a good way to keep her own health goals on track.",

      "Case in point? Braeden greets me at the door of his dressing room by pretending to peek outside the door and hide for a second. Then he gives me a big hug.",
      "After talking about my flight to California, Braeden and I chat for a few moments before diving into the matter at hand: a conversation about his 45th anniversary on \"Y&R.\"",
      "When I ask how he celebrated such a colossal milestone back in February, the 84-year-old has a simple response.",
      "\"I personally don\u2019t celebrate much. You just sit back and you allow yourself to say, 'Whoa, that\u2019s a long time.' I'm not someone who rests on laurels. I don\u2019t do that,\" he explains. \"I\u2019m always future oriented. I'm always (asking), 'What's next? Let's go.'\"",
      "It's a mentality that has served Braeden well throughout his decades-long career in Hollywood and one that helped him cope with the loss of his house amid the California wildfires earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t allow myself to think about that too much because I have known people who then get dragged down by it,\" he says.",
      "Braeden and his wife of nearly 60 years, Dale Russell Gudegast, have found a \"semi-permanent place\" to live as they sort out plans to rebuild their home.",
      "For Braeden, having something to look forward to helps keep him motivated.",
      "\"The solution lies in action, in doing,\" he says.",
      "Braeden, who was born Hans J\u00f6rg Gudegast and grew up in Germany, is certainly a doer. At the age of 18, he moved from Germany to the U.S. and worked a variety of jobs before stumbling into the entertainment industry.",
      "Now, his acting credits run the gamut of film, theater and TV, including roles in \"Titanic,\" \"The Rat Patrol,\" \"Colossus: The Forbin Project\" and countless others.",
      "While building his career, Braeden once visited the set of a soap opera but didn't give the medium much thought again until he later got the opportunity to take on the role of Victor Newman in 1980.",
      "Ironically, the actor was never supposed to stay at \u201cY&R\u201d very long. But as he settled into the temporary role, fans grew to love Victor, and Braeden was offered a long-term contract.",
      "The only problem? Braeden wasn't sold on the character. So he spoke to his wife, who encouraged him to look at the role as a challenge. Then, he sat down with Bill Bell, the co-creator of \"Y&R.\"",
      "\"I said, 'Bill, I\u2019m tired of playing only bad guys. I\u2019ve done that for so many years, on nighttime television, films.' I said, 'Can we attribute a background to this character that explains why he is who he is?' Because we all are formed by it. And he came up with the storyline where I tell Nikki (Newman) that I grew up in an orphanage. I then knew I would stay,\" he recalls.",
      "Braeden's character has been at the center of a plethora of captivating storylines over the years, but he's particularly fond of one that featured Dorothy McGuire and George Kennedy playing his on-screen mother and father.",
      "\"All of that creates the bedrock for what Victor Newman became, and that was the brilliance of Bill Bell, who came up with that storyline,\" Braeden says. \"Those are by far, hands down, the most seminal scenes I\u2019ve done in the show explaining who Victor Newman is.\"",
      "Victor has had many romantic interests over the course of 45 years, but none compare to his epic love story with Nikki Newman (Melody Thomas Scott).",
      "\"The reason Mel and I have been doing it so long is because she gets me. Mel knows how to deal with me. ... And I with her,\" he says while complimenting his \"clever\" and talented co-star.",
      "As the head of Newman Enterprises, Victor is known as a master manipulator in the world of business. But in real life, Braeden says he doesn't possess the same penchant for corporate subterfuge.",
      "\u201cObviously, I don\u2019t do anything that Victor does. I\u2019m not a business guy,\u201d he says, noting that he does have a few things in common with his character.",
      "For instance, Victor never shies away from a fight, and Braeden shares the same signature tenacity.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to confrontation, I don\u2019t back down. I don\u2019t give a f--- who it is. I don\u2019t back down. And that has been the case with me since I was a young boy,\u201d he says.",
      "Victor is known for meddling in his family\u2019s affairs, especially their romantic escapades. But Braeden takes a more even-keeled approach.",
      "\"I love my family and would never dictate to my family,\" he says.",
      "Speaking of family, Braeden lights up when I bring up his son, Christian Gudegast, whom he refers to as his \u201cgreatest accomplishment\u201d in his book, \u201cI\u2019ll Be Damned.\u201d",
      "In a way, Gudegast has followed in his father's footsteps, pursuing a career as a writer and director.",
      "\"I always sort of wanted him to become an actor. And only about half a year ago, he told me why he didn\u2019t want it. Because he saw me at certain times in my life very upset about not getting this or that role,\u201d he explains.",
      "Braeden sent his son to acting school to give him a solid foundation as a director and has supported his dreams ever since.",
      "Braeden's passion for his craft is evident as he recounts his iconic career. Although he had many notable acting credits to his name before joining the cast of \"Y&R,\" he tells me that the soap opera taught him something invaluable about the significance of an actor's work.",
      "\u201cOne of the most profound meanings is to entertain people. I learned that here in this medium and I\u2019m very grateful,\" he says. \"I\u2019m very grateful to fans for that reason because they taught me what this is about \u2014 entertainment,\" he says.",
      "While talking about the volume of work he and his colleagues produce on a weekly basis, the soap opera veteran's pride is evident.",
      "\"I think it\u2019s the toughest medium there is in Hollywood. I\u2019ve done it all,\" he says. \"For writers, this is the hardest job in all of Hollywood, writing for a soap. As an actor, it is equally much the hardest job there is.\"",
      "Braeden goes on to describe just how much work goes into filming a soap opera.",
      "\"In film, we do two or three pages a day,\" he explains.",
      "On the opposite end of the spectrum, Braeden says soap operas typically shoot 100 pages of dialogue a day. As a main star of the show, he's certainly in demand and has a record of shooting 62 pages of dialogue in one day.",
      "I get to witness Braeden in action filming scenes for an upcoming episode, and it's easy to see why he's so respected by his colleagues.",
      "The industry veteran handles his lines with ease and also imbues a sense of fun into his work, chatting animatedly with his co-stars and the crew.",
      "While reading Braeden's autobiography, I was intrigued by a passage where he discusses a quote from playwright and screenwriter Tennessee Williams, who defined happiness as \"insensitivity.\"",
      "After losing his father at the age of 12 and navigating poverty at a young age, I'm curious to know if Braeden's worldview was shaped by these formative experiences and how he himself defines happiness.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no such thing in and of itself. It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s b-------.  (Happiness is) in the doing, and it\u2019s in the few moments after the doing that you feel, \u2018Well, I accomplished something. Great.\u2019 That\u2019s it. A few minutes afterwards, then you\u2019ve got to plan another thing to do. There\u2019s no permanent happiness state,\u201d he explains.",
      "The answer is consistent with the way Braeden has progressed in his career: constantly on the move, consistently challenging himself.",
      "The actor shows no signs of slowing down, and I can't help but selfishly wonder if he will ever leave \"Y&R\" to enjoy a proper retirement. Luckily for me and countless other fans, he has no plans of stepping away from his career anytime soon.",
      "\u201cI love doing what I\u2019m doing. I love doing it. I don\u2019t know why, but I do,\u201d he says."

      "Shannon, whose previous marriage to David Beador played out over the years on \u201cRHOC,\u201d says the No. 1 thing that attracted her to Earl was his \u201ckind eyes\u201d and the eye contact he maintained. \u201cHe was engaged in a conversation,\u201d she tells TODAY.com. \u201cI need to be a priority. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve been a priority in any of the relationships that I\u2019ve been in, and so, that\u2019s my hope.\u201d",
      "Earl was previously married twice and lost one of his wives to leukemia, which is one of the first things he told Shannon when they met. While Shannon and Earl had many sweet moments together, they also had their share of disagreements.",
      "Shannon initially got upset when Earl didn\u2019t comfort her on a particularly emotional night for her: the one-year anniversary of her DUI arrest. A few episodes later, Earl was not happy with Shannon for choosing to go out with her \u201cLove Hotel\u201d castmates, Luann de Lesseps, Ashley Darby and Gizelle Bryant, instead of being there for him as he stressed over the path of a hurricane headed toward his Florida and Georgia homes.",
      "\u201cI did have a few hiccups with Earl,\u201d Shannon says, \u201cbut there\u2019s something about him that when we were together and things were good, it was really good.\u201d",
      "Despite her ups and downs with Earl in Mexico, she says she was \u201ceasily sucked back in\u201d after filming for the show ended.",
      "\u201cAfter the show, we did \u2014 we talked every day,\u201d she says. \u201cI went and stayed with him in Georgia. He came out to Orange County, but in the end, it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have very different personalities, in the long run,\u201d she explains. \u201cAnd we were in a bubble there, but I wish it would\u2019ve been different. But it is what it is.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sad for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, it\u2019s hard to watch the show right now because I remember that I cared about him, and so it\u2019s hard.\u201d",
      "Shannon says she has no interest in dating at this time because she does not want to get hurt again.",
      "\u201cI know that when I watch a show, and I\u2019m invested in certain people, I want them to stay together,\u201d she says. \u201cSo it was important for me to try my hardest to make it work.\u201d",
      "As for what she\u2019s looking for in a partner, Shannon, who also describes herself as \u201ca relationship girl,\u201d says she, most importantly, wants someone with \u201ca kind heart,\u201d adding that looks are \u201cnot that important.\u201d",
      "\u201cI want someone that\u2019s intelligent and that has a sense of humor, because I like to learn from people,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t think that I would be OK on my own, but now that I have been, I kind of like it,\u201d Shannon, who says she does not use dating apps, explains. After her marriage ended, she began dating John Janssen in 2019, and the two very publicly broke up in 2022. Janssen has since moved on with \u201cRHOC\u201d alum Alexis Bellino.",
      "\u201cIn my perfect world, I would meet someone who is confident, successful and thinks it\u2019s really cute that I\u2019m on this silly show and doesn\u2019t want to be a part of it. Because that\u2019s a really hard thing when you\u2019ve been doing it for as long as we have, that, you know, does someone want to be famous or not?\u201d Shannon says.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what happened in my last relationship,\u201d she adds. \u201cHe wanted to be, and I didn\u2019t think he did.\u201d"

      "The 73-year-old actor, who portrayed the iconic Luke Skywalker in six \"Star Wars\" films, expanded upon recent comments that his time with the legendary sci-fi franchise is done.",
      "\"I don't want to make a big PR pronouncement like 'This is my decision,'\" Hamill said. \"I\u2019m just saying that it really felt like a conclusion. My character was given complete closure. I died, ironically by overdosing on the Force, I might point out.\"",

I said that, and then I saw headlines, you know 'Mark Hamill Quit Star Wars.' Well, let me say: they haven\u2019t asked me. It\u2019s not like they said, 'Please come back.'\"",

Their marriage in 1999 made them Britain's most famous couple and near-permanent fixtures in tabloid newspapers and magazines, an obsession that has lasted into the age of social media.",
      "\u201cIt will take a little while for the news to sink in but I\u2019m immensely proud and it\u2019s such an emotional moment for me to share with my family,\" Beckham said.",
      "Beckham, 50, rose from an unremarkable east London upbringing to reach sporting glory with his beloved Manchester United before going on to star for several of Europe's elite teams. He played more than 100 games for the English national team, many as captain, and scored at three World Cups.",
      "He was part of the famous \"Class of \u201992,\" a supremely talented group of young players who signed professional deals in 1992 and went on to form the basis of United's imperial phase of dominance in the 1990s and early 2000s. That culminated in the club's winning an unprecedented \"treble\" of titles in 1999: the Premier League, the European Champions League and the English FA Cup, under manager Alex Ferguson.",
      "Beckham won 19 major trophies in his career and became the first English player to win major titles in four countries.",
      "\u201cTo have played for and captained my country was the greatest privilege of my career and literally a boyhood dream come true,\u201d he said in his statement.",
      "Beckham was an elegant player, and his intelligence made up for his lack of pace and trickery. He was famous for his long passes that opened up defenses and for devastating free kicks, which, according to former teammates, he spent countless hours perfecting.",
      "His career took him to the United States in 2007, where he played for the Los Angeles Galaxy and helped to build soccer's profile in the country.",
      "Beckham has been an ambassador for UNICEF, the United Nations' children's fund, since 2005. Ten years later, the organization launched a fund in his name.",
      "\u201cOff the pitch I have been fortunate to have the opportunity to represent Britain around the world and work with incredible organisations that are supporting communities in need and inspiring the next generation,\" his statement said. \"I\u2019m so lucky to be able to do the work that I do and I\u2019m grateful to be recognised for work that gives me so much fulfilment.\"",
      "Beckham's post-playing career was shaped in part by media entrepreneur Simon Fuller, formerly manager of the Spice Girls. Fuller was instrumental in putting a clause in his contract that would give him a stake in an MLS franchise for $25 million when he finished playing.",
      "As a result, he is now president and co-owner of the Inter Miami MLS franchise, home to Argentine legend Lionel Messi, who is regarded as one of the greatest players in the sport's history.",
      "Beckham has maintained a higher profile than any footballer of his generation. From waiting for hours in the miles-long line to see Queen Elizabeth's coffin (apparently without asking for special access) in 2022 to a four-part Emmy-winning docuseries on Netflix last year, his star profile remains huge.",
      "In 2017, it looked like a knighthood was a long way off when leaked emails allegedly written by Beckham were highly critical of the honors system. A spokesperson for the Beckhams said at the time that the stolen emails were \"hacked and doctored.\"",
      "While they are awarded by the king, or at least a senior royal, honors are actually decided by committees of politicians, civil servants and leading business figures. The overall process is managed by 10 Downing Street, the private office and residence of Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who received a knighthood in 2014."

      "PARIS \u2014 The Louvre, the world\u2019s most-visited museum and a global symbol of art, beauty and endurance, has withstood war, terror, and pandemic \u2014 but on Monday, it was brought to a halt by its own striking staff, who say the institution is crumbling under the weight of mass tourism.",
      "It was an almost unthinkable sight: the home to works by Leonardo da Vinci and millennia of civilization\u2019s greatest treasures \u2014 paralyzed by the very people tasked with welcoming the world to its galleries.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the Mona Lisa moan out here,\u201d said Kevin Ward, 62, from Milwaukee. \u201cThousands of people waiting, no communication, no explanation. I guess even she needs a day off.\u201d",
      "The Louvre has become a symbol of tourism pushed to its limits. As hotspots from Venice to the Acropolis race to curb crowds, the world\u2019s most iconic museum, visited by millions, is hitting a breaking point of its own.",
      "Just a day earlier, coordinated anti-tourism protests swept across southern Europe. Thousands rallied in Mallorca, Venice, Lisbon and beyond, denouncing an economic model they say displaces locals and erodes city life. In Barcelona, activists sprayed tourists with water pistols \u2014 a theatrical bid to \u201ccool down\u201d runaway tourism.",
      "The Louvre\u2019s spontaneous strike erupted during a routine internal meeting, as gallery attendants, ticket agents and security personnel refused to take up their posts in protest over unmanageable crowds, chronic understaffing and what one union called \u201cuntenable\u201d working conditions.",
      "It\u2019s rare for the Louvre to close its doors. It has happened during war, during the pandemic, and in a handful of strikes \u2014 including spontaneous walkouts over overcrowding in 2019 and safety fears in 2013. But seldom has it happened so suddenly, without warning, and in full view of the crowds.",
      "What\u2019s more, the disruption comes just months after President Emmanuel Macron unveiled a sweeping decade-long plan to rescue the Louvre from precisely the problems now boiling over \u2014 water leaks, dangerous temperature swings, outdated infrastructure, and foot traffic far beyond what the museum can handle.",
      "But for workers on the ground, that promised future feels distant.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t wait six years for help,\u201d said Sarah Sefian, a front-of-house gallery attendant and visitor services agent. \u201cOur teams are under pressure now. It\u2019s not just about the art \u2014 it\u2019s about the people protecting it.\u201d",
      "The Mona Lisa\u2019s daily mob",
      "At the center of it all is the Mona Lisa \u2014 a 16th-century portrait that draws modern-day crowds more akin to a celebrity meet-and-greet than an art experience.",
      "Roughly 20,000 people a day squeeze into the Salle des \u00c9tats, the museum\u2019s largest room, just to snap a selfie with Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s enigmatic woman behind protective glass. The scene is often noisy, jostling, and so dense that many barely glance at the masterpieces flanking her \u2014 works by Titian and Veronese that go largely ignored.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see a painting,\u201d said Ji-Hyun Park, 28, who flew from Seoul to Paris. \u201cYou see phones. You see elbows. You feel heat. And then, you\u2019re pushed out.\u201d",
      "Macron\u2019s renovation blueprint, dubbed the \u201cLouvre New Renaissance,\u201d promises a remedy. The Mona Lisa will finally get her own dedicated room, accessible through a timed-entry ticket. A new entrance near the Seine River is also planned by 2031 to relieve pressure from the overwhelmed pyramid hub.",
      "\u201cConditions of display, explanation and presentation will be up to what the Mona Lisa deserves,\u201d Macron said in January.",
      "But Louvre workers call Macron hypocritical and say the 700 million to 800 million-euro ($730 million to $834 million) renovation plan masks a deeper crisis. While Macron is investing in new entrances and exhibition space, the Louvre\u2019s annual operating subsidies from the French state have shrunk by more than 20% over the past decade \u2014 even as visitor numbers soared.",
      "\u201cWe take it very badly that Monsieur Le President makes his speeches here in our museum,\u201d Sefian said, \u201cbut when you scratch the surface, the financial investment of the state is getting worse with each passing year.\u201d",
      "While many striking staff planned to remain off duty all day, Sefian said some workers may return temporarily to open a limited \u201cmasterpiece route\u201d for a couple of hours, allowing access to select highlights including the Mona Lisa and the Venus de Milo. The full museum might reopen as normal on Wednesday, and some tourists with time-sensitive tickets for Monday may be allowed to reuse them then. On Tuesday the Louvre is closed.",
      "A museum in limbo",
      "The Louvre welcomed 8.7 million visitors last year \u2014 more than double what its infrastructure was designed to accommodate. Even with a daily cap of 30,000, staff say the experience has become a daily test of endurance, with too few rest areas, limited bathrooms, and summer heat magnified by the pyramid\u2019s greenhouse effect.",
      "In a leaked memo, Louvre President Laurence des Cars warned that parts of the building are \u201cno longer watertight,\u201d that temperature fluctuations endanger priceless art, and that even basic visitor needs \u2014 food, restrooms, signage \u2014 fall far below international standards. She described the experience simply as \u201ca physical ordeal.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat began as a scheduled monthly information session turned into a mass expression of exasperation,\u201d Sefian said. Talks between workers and management began at 10:30 a.m. and continued into the afternoon.",
      "The full renovation plan is expected to be financed through ticket revenue, private donations, state funds, and licensing fees from the Louvre\u2019s Abu Dhabi branch. Ticket prices for non-EU tourists are expected to rise later this year.",
      "But workers say their needs are more urgent than any 10-year plan.",
      "Unlike other major sites in Paris, such as Notre Dame cathedral or the Centre Pompidou museum, both of which are undergoing government-backed restorations, the Louvre remains stuck in limbo \u2014 neither fully funded nor fully functional.",
      "President Macron, who delivered his 2017 election victory speech at the Louvre and showcased it during the 2024 Paris Olympics, has promised a safer, more modern museum by the end of the decade.",
      "Until then, France\u2019s greatest cultural treasure \u2014 and the millions who flock to see it \u2014 remain caught between the cracks."

      "The Americans have won their group in 16 of 17 Gold Cups, along with a second-place finish behind Panama in 2011, and improved their group stage record to 41 wins, one loss and five draws. They play invited guest Saudi Arabia on Thursday at Austin, Texas, then close group play on June 22 against Haiti at Arlington, Texas.",

      "Metreweli takes over at MI6 as the agency faces growing challenges from states including China and Russia, whose use of cyber tools, espionage and influence operations threatens global stability and British interests, even as it remains on alert against terrorist threats.",
      "Metreweli is the first woman to get the top job, known as C \u2014 rather than M, the fictional MI6 chief of the 007 thrillers. M was played onscreen by Judi Dench in seven Bond movies starting in the 1990s.",
      "She will take up her post in the fall, replacing Richard Moore, who has held the job for five years.",
      "Britain\u2019s two other main intelligence agencies have already shattered the spy world\u2019s glass ceiling. MI5, the domestic security service, was led by Stella Rimington from 1992 to 1996 and Eliza Manningham-Buller from 2002 to 2007. Anne Keast-Butler became head of electronic and cyber-intelligence agency GCHQ in 2023.",
      "Moore, an Oxford-educated former diplomat, fit the 007 mold like a Savile Row suit. But in recent years MI6 has worked to increase diversity, broadening its recruitment process from the traditional \u201ctap on the shoulder\u201d at an elite university.

      "Like many things about MI6, also known as the Secret Intelligence Service, the process of choosing a new chief took place out of public view.

The job was open to applicants from other intelligence agencies, the civil service, the diplomatic service, the armed forces or the police.",
      "In the end, MI6 opted for an internal candidate with a 25-year career in espionage, a degree in anthropology from Cambridge University \u2014 where she was on the women\u2019s rowing team \u2014 and expertise in cutting-edge technology.",
      "\u201cAt a time of global instability and emerging security threats, where technology is power and our adversaries are working ever closer together, Blaise will ensure the U.K. can tackle these challenges head on to keep Britain safe and secure at home and abroad,\u201d said Foreign Secretary David Lammy, who oversees MI6."

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/trump-went-opposing-israels-strikes-iran-reluctant-support-rcna213091",
    "published": "Mon, 16 Jun 2025 09:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "President Trump had opposed Israeli action against Iran, but came to believe Israel had reason to act and that the U.S. would have to lend some support.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump had opposed Israeli military action against Iran, favoring negotiations over bombing. But in the days before the strikes began, he became convinced that Israel\u2019s heightened anxiety over Iran\u2019s nuclear enrichment capabilities was warranted.",
      "After a pivotal briefing from the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, on Israel\u2019s plans and U.S. options for supporting its operation, he gave tacit approval to Israel to have at it and decided to provide limited U.S. backing.",
      "When Caine briefed him on June 8, Trump was increasingly frustrated with Iran for not responding to the latest proposal for a nuclear deal. He still remained hopeful that his Middle East peace negotiator, Steve Witkoff, who had been scheduled to conduct another round of peace talks in the region Sunday, could soon get an agreement over the line.",
      "Trump was also facing private pressure from longtime allies who advocate more isolationist policies and wanted him to stop Israel from taking military action or at least withhold U.S. support for any such operation.",
      "This account of Trump\u2019s thinking leading up to the Israeli operation is based on interviews with five current U.S. officials and two Middle Eastern officials, as well as two people with knowledge of the deliberations, two former U.S officials familiar with the deliberations and a Trump ally. The White House didn\u2019t immediately comment, and the Defense Department didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "In recent weeks, Israel grew more convinced that the threat posed by Tehran was getting increasingly serious and urgent. And while he had already decided not to stand in Israel\u2019s way, on Thursday, only hours before the strikes began, Trump remained at least publicly hopeful that diplomacy would win the day.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t want them going in, because I think it would blow it \u2014 might help it actually, but it also could blow it, but we\u2019ve had very good discussions with Iran,\u201d Trump told reporters at a bill signing ceremony. \u201cI prefer the more friendly path.\u201d",
      "Behind the scenes, the Israelis had already laid much of the groundwork for Trump\u2019s measured change. Trump had hoped Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu could be persuaded not to mount an attack. But over the past week, he came to accept that Israel was determined to neutralize Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities and that the United States would have to lend some military support for defensive purposes, as well as some intelligence support.",
      "After the strikes began Thursday evening, the administration took pains to say it had provided no military assistance to Israel, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is also the national security adviser, pointedly omitted any mention of U.S. support for Israel\u2019s operations in a statement. But the administration\u2019s public statements the next day did leave the door open to the United States\u2019 having provided some of the kind of intelligence Israel needed to mount an attack.",
      "Israel was able to conduct its initial strikes mostly with its own intelligence and capabilities \u2014 killing three military leaders and nine top scientists working on nuclear enrichment and destroying several nuclear enrichment sites, Israeli officials have said \u2014 but it also leaned heavily on American intelligence, bunker-buster bombs that were provided this year and air defense systems, some of which were scrambled into the region quickly in recent days.",
      "But Trump still wouldn\u2019t sign off on everything Israel wanted. After the start of their military campaign, the Israelis collected intelligence that could have allowed them to target and kill Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Netanyahu presented the operation to Trump, who opposed the plan altogether and wouldn\u2019t allow the United States to participate, according to two U.S. officials. No Americans had been killed in the conflict, so Trump didn\u2019t believe it would be appropriate to remove Khamenei, the political leader, and recommended against the Israelis\u2019 conducting the operation, the officials said.",
      "On Sunday, he appeared to advocate again for talks over strikes, saying on his social media platform, Truth Social: \u201cIran and Israel should make a deal, and will make a deal, just like I got India and Pakistan to make. ... Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that\u2019s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s approach to Israel\u2019s military campaign started to take form last Sunday at Camp David, the presidential retreat in rural Maryland. By that time, Israeli officials had already begun to share extensive information with U.S. officials about their potential operation. Caine, the Joint Chiefs chairman, briefed Trump and his national security team about the Israeli plans to strike Iran and U.S. options, according to two U.S. officials and one of the people familiar with the deliberations.",
      "Those options, the three sources said, included logistical support, like refueling Israeli jet fighters, sharing intelligence and using the American military\u2019s electronic warfare capabilities to help Israel jam enemy weapons and communications. Another option was to provide direct military support to Israel, even having U.S. jets drop munitions in active combat alongside Israeli fighters, for example.",
      "And yet another option, Caine briefed Trump, was to do nothing at all.",
      "Trump has consistently said he wants to extract the United States from foreign conflicts and has sought to use diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine and the fighting in Gaza, albeit without success.",
      "But Israel was getting anxious, and it wasn\u2019t convinced that Trump\u2019s plan for peace in the region would work. Netanyahu and his war Cabinet didn\u2019t have faith in the U.S. negotiations with Iran taking place in Oman, despite Washington\u2019s public pronouncements that a deal was close.",
      "For months, the Trump administration has pressed the Israelis not to carry out strikes on Iran and warned that the United States wouldn\u2019t support them if they did.",
      "By the end of last week, the White House\u2019s public tone started to include more support for Israel, and in private it shifted from strong opposition against a widespread military operation to acceptance that it was likely to happen and less resistance to it.",
      "Among the reasons for Trump\u2019s change of heart was the declaration Thursday by the United Nations\u2019 nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, that Iran was in breach of its nonproliferation requirements. Trump was also concerned by the sense coming from Israel, the United States and the IAEA that Iran had achieved leaps in its nuclear program, and he didn\u2019t want to be the president on whose watch it was able to obtain a nuclear weapon.",
      "The United States had already been quietly moving some pieces into place to prepare for the Israeli attack. In recent days, U.S. European Command was told some of its P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol and reconnaissance planes would be diverted to the Middle East to conduct surveillance.",
      "Then, in remarks that drew little attention last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that more than 20,000 U.S. anti-drone missiles meant for Kyiv had been diverted \u2014 to the Middle East.",
      "Trump and Netanyahu spoke several times in the previous week, but by last Monday, Trump had grown convinced that Israel was going to strike and was starting to put more pieces into place to help support the strike.",
      "Soon after that conversation last Monday, the Pentagon directed European Command to send a Navy destroyer to sit off Israel to help defend it in the likely event of a counterattack from Tehran, joining two more and a carrier strike group already there.",
      "Witkoff had been expected to travel to Muscat for peace talks as late as Friday. With the conflict still active, the U.S. side acknowledged that those talks were off. But it\u2019s not shutting the door to future discussions.",
      "\u201cWhile there will be no meeting Sunday, we remain committed to talks and hope the Iranians will come to the table soon,\u201d an administration official told news organizations."

    "story": [
      "Israeli military assaults on the Gaza Strip\u2019s hospitals have ramped up in recent weeks to the highest level so far this year, bringing a health system already weakened by 19 months of war to a breaking point. NBC News has analyzed 27 videos and images from the last two months taken by civilians and our own journalists on the ground to piece together a picture of the full extent of the destruction of a health system engulfed in war.",
      "In footage from a surveillance camera, men, women and children could be seen crossing the entrance to Khan Younis\u2019 European Hospital moments before a missile hit, blasting people into the air as others scattered in panic. Another video, posted to social media and verified by NBC News, showed the fiery aftermath of an explosion at a medical warehouse near Al-Awda Hospital, in northern Gaza, which has been attacked repeatedly, including on May 22 and again on May 24.",
      "\u201cNearly all hospitals in Gaza are now damaged or destroyed, and half of them are no longer operational,\u201d Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, told NBC News. During the war, Gaza\u2019s hospitals have eked back services, only to be repeatedly struck or besieged again.",
      "Hospitals are protected under international humanitarian law, but Israel has maintained that Hamas uses hospitals and medical centers for military activities, opening them to attack. Hamas has denied doing so. Humanitarian groups, including the United Nations, have said Israel has not provided sufficient information to substantiate many of its claims and have called for independent investigations of Israel\u2019s attacks and Hamas\u2019 alleged misuse of the facilities.",
      "Earlier this week, however, the Israeli military gave a small group of reporters a tour of a tunnel that was uncovered beneath the European Hospital, where it said it had recovered the body of Hamas\u2019 military chief Mohammed Sinwar.",
      "\u201cWe cannot stress this enough: Hospitals must never be militarized or targeted. If they are, it may constitute a war crime,\u201d Laerke said.",
      "Of Gaza\u2019s 36 hospitals, none are fully functioning; 17 are providing partial services, and 19 are not functioning at all, according to World Health Organization data from Monday. The wider health system, including ambulances, field hospitals and clinics, has been attacked more than 700 times since the start of the war, killing at least 900 people and injuring more than 1,000. (The death toll across Gaza is more than 55,000, according to the health ministry.)",
      "After a ceasefire was called in January, Israeli military attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system had abated. The truce fell apart in March, and WHO data shows a ramping up of attacks in recent weeks. While the organization tallied five attacks on Gaza\u2019s health system in April, after the first three weeks of May, the number of attacks had quadrupled to 21, with at least three more attacks since, including on the vicinity of a dialysis center at the Indonesian Hospital on June 1 and strikes on Al-Aqsa and Al-Ahli Hospitals on June 4 and 5. In addition, hostilities near Al-Amal Hospital have rendered it \u201cout of service,\u201d the WHO said Monday.",
      "The earliest attack recorded by NBC News during that two-month period was on April 2, when an Israeli airstrike hit a UNRWA clinic in Jabalia, north of Gaza City, that was housing displaced people. Video captured by NBC News on the ground documented the chaotic aftermath: walls crushed to rubble, charred mattresses, furniture blasted into shards. A child\u2019s small, shrouded body was loaded onto a donkey cart to be taken to the morgue.",
      "In another case, the Israel Defense Forces struck two hospitals on the same day, May 13, both in Khan Younis. Video verified by NBC News shows several large plumes of smoke rising from the grounds of the European Hospital. Palestinian health officials said at least 16 people were killed and dozens more injured. The WHO said the facility had been forced to suspend services.",
      "Also struck that day was the Nasser Medical Complex. Video posted by the U.N. showed scattered debris, twisted hospital beds and damaged equipment. It was the fourth time Nasser had been hit during the war, according to the U.N., with the latest strike killing two people and injuring a dozen others.",
      "In a statement in response to those attacks, the IDF said its forces had targeted a command and control center located at Nasser Hospital and \u201ca Hamas underground terrorist infrastructure site\u201d underneath the European Hospital.",
      "The IDF provided evidence of what it said was a Hamas tunnel beneath the European Hospital. It did not, however, provide evidence for the command and control center at Nasser, or for the following cases, but broadly said: \u201cThe Hamas terrorist organization continues to use hospitals in the Gaza Strip for terrorist activity.\u201d NBC News is not able to independently verify the IDF\u2019s statements."

      "But Iran still has buried nuclear facilities at Fordow and elsewhere that it could potentially use if it chose to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and rescind its commitment not to pursue nuclear weapons. In that case, Iran would need to enrich uranium to weapon-grade levels, a short technical step with its current stockpile, and then build a nuclear warhead. That effort could take roughly a year or more, most experts estimate.",
      "The CIA declined to comment as to whether there were any indications that Iran was moving to pull out of the NPT and pursue nuclear weapons.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump appears to be trying to use the Israeli military attack as leverage over Iran, pushing it to make concessions or else face even harsher military strikes. But Iran may calculate that the time for negotiations is over and opt to build nuclear weapons, according to Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank.",
      "\u201cOne of the strategic risks in targeting Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure is the potential for backlash,\u201d Vaez said. The strikes \u201ccould incentivize Tehran to reconstitute its program with renewed urgency, driven by a heightened resolve to achieve a credible nuclear deterrent,\u201d he said.",
      "Iran has invested decades of effort and trillions of dollars in building its nuclear program, and Iranian political leaders portray it as a point of national pride, a symbol of the country\u2019s independence and technological progress.",
      "Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank, said Iran\u2019s leadership will likely choose to develop nuclear weapons rather than give up the program it sees as a patriotic endeavor.",
      "\u201cIt has become a symbol of national prestige and honor,\u201d Miller said on MSNBC.",
      "\u201cWhen all is said and done, and this regime stays in power, which I suspect it will, the Iranians will probably make a decision to go all out in an effort to weaponize,\u201d Miller said. \u201cAnd the Americans and the Israelis are going to have to figure out, over time, how to deal with it.\u201c",
      "Jonathan Panikoff, a former deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Iran may conclude that pursuing nuclear weapons is the only way to safeguard the regime.",
      "Iran \u201cmay determine that the Israeli strikes mean time is up for the regime to decide whether to obtain a bomb, if it hasn\u2019t done so already,\u201d Panikoff, now at the Atlantic Council think tank, wrote in an analysis. \u201cThe conclusion could be that it can no longer sit on the proverbial nuclear fence, and that it has to rush for a bomb or risk never having one.\u201d",
      "To many Iranian political leaders, securing a nuclear weapon -- or nuclear weapons capability -- is vital for the survival of the regime itself, he added.",
      "But it was unclear if Israel\u2019s military strikes could deliver a knock-out blow that would make it impossible for Iran to build nuclear weapons, some experts said.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former senior Pentagon official and a fellow at the Atlantic Council, said it was likely that the Israeli assault, which included sabotage operations, had caused too much damage to Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and equipment to enable Iran to rush toward building a bomb.",
      "Iran was caught flat-footed by the Israeli attack, even though Israel had sent clear warnings for years and in recent months that it would not tolerate an advancing Iranian nuclear program, Plitsas said.",
      "\u201cThe Iranians have misread the signals from Israel again and again,\u201d he said.",
      "Even a successful series of strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear sites might only delay Tehran\u2019s ability to develop the bomb by up to two years, according to past comments by U.S. officials and estimates by experts.",
      "In 2012, Robert Gates, shortly after he stepped down as defense secretary, said military strikes against Iran\u2019s nuclear program would likely fail in the end to prevent Tehran from developing the bomb.",
      "\u201cSuch an attack would make a nuclear-armed Iran inevitable,\u201d Gates said at the time. \u201cThey would just bury the program deeper and make it more covert.\u201d",
      "Iran maintains its nuclear program is designed for purely civilian purposes to generate energy and research, but Western powers have long accused Tehran of laying the ground for a nuclear weapons project, citing enrichment activity far beyond what\u2019s required for peaceful uses. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Iran had a nuclear weapons program but halted the project in 2003.",
      "A report in May from the International Atomic Energy Agency concluded Iran was not fully cooperating with U.N. inspectors and that the agency could not provide assurance that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cexclusively peaceful.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, the IAEA censured Iran for failing to comply with nonproliferation obligations designed to prevent Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon. It was the first such censure in 20 years.",
      "Democratic lawmakers have criticized Trump for pulling, during his first term, the U.S. out of a 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed limits on its nuclear activities, saying that decision opened the way to the current crisis."
