      "Prosecutors are urging a New York federal judge to send music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years",
      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a New York federal judge Tuesday to send Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs to prison for over 11 years following his conviction on prostitution-related charges, citing one of his accusers who said she lives in fear of the music mogul's release from detention.",
      "\u201cHis crimes of conviction are serious and have warranted sentences over ten years in multiple cases for defendants who, like Sean Combs, engaged in violence and put others in fear,\u201d they wrote in a presentence submission requesting at least 11 years and three months in prison.",
      "They filed their sentencing recommendation shortly after midnight, including letters from some of his accusers describing how his violence and demands had impacted their lives.",
      "They called Combs \u201cunrepentant\u201d and said Combs had conceded his acts of violence and abuse throughout his trial but \u201cincredibly, ... he now argues that his victims should shoulder the blame.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, has remained jailed since his July conviction on charges related to arranging male sex workers to travel to hotels or residences where he directed them to have sex with his girlfriends.",
      "The elaborate dayslong, drug-fueled sexual events were often filmed by Combs. Defense attorneys have asked that he be sentenced to no more than 14 months in prison. Sentencing is set for Friday.",
      "In July, Combs was convicted of two charges for violating the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution, for arranging the paid sexual encounters between his girlfriends and male sex workers. Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The same jury acquitted the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that could have resulted in a life sentence.",
      "Last week, the defense submitted its presentence arguments, saying Combs has suffered enough during his nearly 13 months behind bars that he should be freed soon.",
      "They wrote that he became a changed man in a Brooklyn federal lockup, where he has been under constant suicide watch and learned to react calmly to threats rather than violently, even when a fellow inmate confronted him with a shiv.",
      "They said Combs has realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "Prosecutors said Combs was now trying to cast himself as a victim.",
      "\u201cHe is not the victim,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThe Court should focus on the very real effects that the defendant\u2019s conduct had on the lives of the actual victims, his victims.\u201d",

Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d said she felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers. She testified that an enraged Combs once put her in a chokehold and punched her in the face.",
      "In a letter accompanying the prosecutors' submission, Cassie wrote that she testified while nine months pregnant during Combs' trial \u201cin front of a packed courtroom about the most traumatic and horrifying chapter in my life. I testified that from age nineteen, Sean Combs used violence, threats, substances, and control over my career to trap me in over a decade of abuse.\u201d",
      "Cassie wrote that Combs controlled her like a puppet.",
      "\u201cThese events were degrading and disgusting, leaving me with infections, illnesses, and days of physical and emotional exhaustion before he demanded it all again. Sex acts became my full-time job, used as the only way to stay in his good graces,\u201d she said.",
      "Cassie said she still has nightmares and flashbacks on an everyday basis and requires psychological care to cope.",
      "\u201cMy worries that Sean Combs or his associates will come after me and my family is my reality. I have in fact moved my family out of the New York area and am keeping as private and quiet as I possibly can because I am so scared that if he walks free, his first actions will be swift retribution towards me and others who spoke up about his abuse at trial,\u201d Cassie said.",
      "The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie has.",
      "In an indictment, prosecutors asserted that Combs used his fame, wealth and violence to force and manipulate Cassie and Jane, now-ex-girlfriends, into the sexual performances he called \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "After Combs was convicted, Judge Arun Subramanian immediately refused a defense request to grant him bail.",

    "story": [
      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",
      "\u201cThey know the goal of the media is to get around the official gobbledygook and get out the truth,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey may not help you. But some of them want to help Americans know what is going on.\u201d",
      "Experienced national security reporters know there are many ways to get information, including through other channels of government and people in the private sector. \u201cThe Pentagon is always very well versed in the advantages of controlling the story, so they always try to do that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reporters know that. They've known that for decades.\u201d",
      "Reporters who don\u2019t follow the new rules won\u2019t necessarily be expelled immediately, Parnell told the reporter\u2019s committee. But access will be determined by Hegseth\u2019s team.",
      "While reporters already stationed in the Pentagon were given until Sept. 30 to sign, they were allowed to request an additional five days for legal review.",
      "Although the Times, Washington Post and Atlantic all put out statements against the Pentagon's plan, none of the publications would say what they have recommended that their reporters do \u2014 perhaps an indication that they consider negotiations potentially fruitful.",
      "President Donald Trump hasn't hesitated to fight the media when he thinks he's been wronged, launching lawsuits against CBS News, ABC News, The Wall Street Journal and the Times. Yet he's also frequently accessible to the press, more so than many of his predecessors, and there has been some uncertainty in the White House about the Pentagon's policy.",
      "When a reporter asked, \u201cshould the Pentagon be in charge of deciding what reporters can report on?\u201d the president replied, \u201cNo, I don't think so. Listen, nothing stops reporters. You know that.\u201d",
      "Goldberg noted that it's more than just an issue for reporters. \u201cThe American people have a right to know what the world's most powerful military does in their name and with their money,\u201d he said. \u201cThat seems fairly obvious to me.\u201d",

      "Bad Bunny has been chosen to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, marking a significant moment for Latin identity on a major stage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- The selection of Bad Bunny to headline the Super Bowl halftime show is about more than music.",
      "The move signals a cultural spotlight for Latin identity at America\u2019s most-watched television event. It also raises fresh questions about how much space there will be for his trademark symbolism and social commentary \u2014 including his past criticism of President Donald Trump \u2014 given the NFL's history of keeping performances tightly managed.",
      "Here are some things to know about the selection.",
      "The halftime show is a collaboration between the NFL, Roc Nation and Apple Music.",
      "Roc Nation, Jay-Z\u2019s entertainment company, has curated performers since 2019 and returns alongside veteran producer Jesse Collins. Apple Music distributes the performance, while the NFL ultimately controls the stage, broadcast and branding.",
      "Artists don\u2019t get a paycheck for performing. However, their payoff is global exposure. That imbalance gives the league leverage, though history shows that high-powered stars sometimes defy the league\u2019s guardrails.",
      "The NFL has a track record of pushing back when artists get political. However, some performers don't always comply.",
      "\u2022 In 2020, the league asked Jennifer Lopez to cut a segment featuring children in cages, a critique of U.S. immigration policies. She refused.",
      "\u2022 In 2022, it was reported that Dr. Dre and Eminem were both advised not to kneel or reference police, but they went forward.",
      "\u2022 Rapper M.I.A. flashed a middle finger during Madonna\u2019s set, earning a hefty fine in 2012. She and the NFL ultimately reached a settlement ending their multimillion dollar dispute a couple years later.",
      "While Bad Bunny is a known hitmaker, he\u2019s also an artist who ties his music to Puerto Rican identity, colonial politics and immigrant struggles. His Super Bowl announcement included a pointed dedication: \u201cThis is for my people, my culture, and our history.\u201d",
      "That alone sets the stage for a performance that could carry layered meanings far beyond spectacle.",
      "In his career, Bad Bunny has become one of the world\u2019s most streamed artists with albums such as \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti,\u201d an all-Spanish-language record.",
      "The 31-year-old artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio has won three Grammys and 12 Latin Grammys. He has become a global ambassador for Latin music, starred in films such as \u201cBullet Train,\u201d \u201cCaught Stealing\u201d and \u201cHappy Gilmore 2,\u201d and collaborated with top fashion houses. He enters November's Latin Grammys as the leading nominee with 12, dethroning producer and songwriter \u00c9dgar Barrera.",
      "Bad Bunny has been vocal in his opposition to Trump and his policies. In the final weeks of the 2024 campaign, he backed former Vice President Kamala Harris after a comedian at Trump\u2019s Madison Square Garden rally mocked Puerto Rico as a \u201cfloating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Days later, Bad Bunny posted a video showcasing Puerto Rico\u2019s beaches and artists, captioned simply: \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

He\u2019s pushed for the late Pete Rose\u2019s Hall of Fame induction, threatened to block Washington\u2019s new stadium deal if the team didn\u2019t restore its old name, and frequently used sporting events as political platforms.",

      "And just last month, Trump inserted himself into the backlash over Cracker Barrel\u2019s new logo, posting on Truth Social that the company should stick with its old design. When the chain reversed course, he celebrated the decision as a personal victory.",
      "For Bad Bunny, the halftime show is the ultimate stage to showcase his music, heritage and global influence. For the NFL and Apple Music, it\u2019s a balancing act: deliver a spectacle that celebrates diversity without igniting controversy that scares off advertisers.",
      "If Bad Bunny leans strictly into spectacle, the moment could be historic for Latin music. If he threads in political symbolism, it could become one of the most dissected halftime performances in Super Bowl history.",

      "\u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d Paul Thomas Anderson\u2019s widely acclaimed American epic of rebellion and resistance, opened with $22.4 million in ticket sales from North American theaters over the weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "Anderson\u2019s ultracontemporary opus signifies a major gamble by Warner Bros. With \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d the studio is making a $130 million-plus bet that audiences would come out for 170-minute-long powerhouse drama from one of cinema\u2019s most celebrated auteurs the way they usually only turn up for a franchise or superhero movie.",
      "Anderson, many critics said, delivered the movie of year. \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor and Sean Penn, has been hailed as a film brimming with many of the political conflicts of today. Oscar prognosticators have pegged it this year\u2019s best-picture front-runner. Aided by DiCaprio\u2019s drawing power, the film added $26.1 million overseas.",
      "But good reviews, star power and a marquee filmmaker are nowadays often insufficient to make a hit. For a movie that cost at least $130 million to make, plus many millions more to market, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will have a long road to reach profitability. For most releases with such a high budget, a $22.4 million start would be a disappointment.",
      "Executives for Warner Bros. declined to be interviewed about the opening.",
      "Yet \u201cOne Battle After Another,\u201d like movies from earlier movie eras, will hope its time in theaters is more about the long run than opening weekend. Warners is hoping word-of-mouth, awards conversation and a rolling awareness that \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is a major movie event, will keep ticket sales strong in the weeks, or even months, to come.",
      "Some signs suggest that\u2019s possible. Audiences gave \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d an \u201cA\u201d CinemaScore. That\u2019s far better than CinemaScores for previous Anderson wide releases, including 1997\u2019s \u201cBoogie Nights\u201d (\u201cC\u201d), 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia\u201d (\u201cC-\u201d) and 2002\u2019s \u201cPunch-Drunk Love\u201d (\u201cD+).",
      "\u201cThe long-term playability is going to be key for this,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cAnd given the outpouring of support by critics and audiences, alike, that's where it's going to make back its budget.\u201d",
      "Yet as highly regarded as Anderson is, his films have rarely made a big impact at the box office. His biggest hit was 2007\u2019s \u201cThere Will Be Blood,\u201d which collected $76.4 million worldwide.",
      "For Warner Bros., \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d marked its ninth movie this year to open No. 1, more than any other studio. That success \u2014 with $4 billion in global sales \u2014 has included some refreshingly original films that haven\u2019t always made their most obvious way into theaters.",
      "Warners released Ryan Coogler\u2019s \u201cSinners\u201d in April, and it went on to gross $366.7 million worldwide. \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d chose to opt out of the usual fall festival platforms for prestige films, and first screened while most critics were in Venice or Toronto. Yet \u201cSinners\u201d and \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d will likely be favorites for many of the same prizes in the coming awards season.",
      "Anderson\u2019s film, loosely inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d stars DiCaprio as a former revolutionary living off the grid with his teenage daughter (Chase Infiniti). Shot in VistaVision, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d played in several large-screen formats, including 70mm, IMAX, 70mm and, on four screens, in VistaVision.",
      "Second place went \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie.\u201d The Universal Pictures release, produced by DreamWorks Animation, grossed $13.5 million in 3,500 theaters. It\u2019s a good start for the G-rated film, based on the long-running series. \u201cGabby\u2019s Dollhouse: The Movie,\u201d which cost $32 million to make, also earned an \u201cA+\u201d CinemaScore from audiences.",

      "NEW YORK -- Taylor Heine, 35, is often multitasking when she watches TV shows or movies at home. \u201cI\u2019ll be playing on the phone, loving on my animals, maybe cleaning, picking up,\u201d she says.",
      "So she watches with the subtitles turned on.",
      "\u201cThat way I can kind of switch back and forth, be able to listen to it or look back at the screen and I know what\u2019s going on, Heine says.\u201d She can also catch up if she misses a piece of dialogue.",

      "\"When he\u2019s cooking or banging around in the kitchen, that way I don\u2019t have to blare the TV,\" she says.",
      "Closed captions or subtitles can be an acquired taste. Some people find them distracting, and even family members in the same household can be in disagreement, resulting in tussles for the remote. But Heine, who lives in Johnson City, Tennessee, is in good company, according to a new survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research: People under age 45 are more likely to use them than older adults.",
      "The poll finds that about 4 in 10 adults under 45 use subtitles at least \u201coften\u201d when watching TV or movies, compared with about 3 in 10 adults older than 45. Those 60 and older are especially likely to say they \u201cnever\u201d use subtitles.",
      "The poll suggests many young adults use subtitles because they are watching in noisy environments, whereas older adults choose them to better hear or understand what is being said.",
      "That makes sense to David Barber, a sound editor and mixer and president of the Motion Picture Sound Editors.",
      "\u201cPart of it is cultural,\u201d Barber says. \u201cWhat the younger kids are doing is, a lot of them will multitask. They\u2019ll listen to music while they\u2019re watching a show. So they\u2019re catching bits and pieces of this, bits and pieces of that. I think they probably are half-listening and half-watching. It\u2019s an interesting phenomenon.\u201d",
      "Many people, regardless of age, use closed captions simply to better catch dialogue.",
      "Most subtitle-users, 55%, say they use closed captions because they want to catch every word. About 4 in 10 say they do so because of difficulty understanding accents or because they are watching a foreign movie or show.",
      "Ariaunna Davis, 21, says she typically uses subtitles if she is in an environment where she cannot hear the audio and does not want to blast the volume, or if she cannot understand a character\u2019s accent.",
      "\u201cIf I want to know most of the words that are being said and the audio\u2019s a bit iffy, then that\u2019s the moment I\u2019ll mostly use captions,\u201d she says.",
      "Adrian Alaniz, 31, of Midland, Texas, thinks his hearing was slightly damaged by the concerts he attended when he was younger. With subtitles, he can be sure he is understanding what is going on, particularly if he is eating something crunchy like a bag of chips.",
      "In the animated shows Alaniz watches, the subtitles are particularly helpful for translation. There have been times, he says, when dubbed audio and subtitles do not match. \u201cSometimes the audio doesn\u2019t come across as clearly and the subtitles do help in that matter,\u201d he says.",
      "The poll found that about 3 in 10 U.S. adults use subtitles because they are watching in a noisy environment, while roughly one-quarter say they do so because of poor audio quality.",

      "Paul Thomas Anderson has spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d",
      "LOS ANGELES -- Paul Thomas Anderson spent about 20 years writing \u201cOne Battle After Another.\u201d After two decades, it\u2019s never felt more relevant.",
      "The epic action thriller, inspired by Thomas Pynchon\u2019s \u201cVineland,\u201d hits theaters Friday. With a running time of 2 hours and 50 minutes, \u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d wastes no time immersing audiences in its politically charged world.",
      "The revolution will not be televised, but it will be placed at the front and center of Anderson\u2019s film. The director isn\u2019t there to make his audience comfortable, star Teyana Taylor says, as he zeros in on themes of immigration, racism and systemic corruption showcased at their most absurd.",
      "\u201cI feel like PTA calls out a lot of things that are trying to get swept under the rug,\u201d Taylor told The Associated Press, referring to the director by his nickname. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I respect. This is really waking, shaking and baking some s---. Like, you gotta shake the table.\u201d",
      "Taylor\u2019s character, Perfidia Beverly Hills, is a member of the Weather Underground-inspired French 75 revolutionary group. From the film\u2019s first scene, we see the French 75 take matters into their own hands, liberating undocumented detainees, destroying corrupt political offices and launching their own form of justice, one right after the other. The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",
      "\u201cI mean, this movie is based on some of the revolutionaries and anarchists of the late '60s, the Weathermen that were fighting for civil rights, environmentalism too at the time, capitalism, Vietnam,\u201d star Leonardo DiCaprio told the AP. \u201cBut it\u2019s about the implosion of that too, about the extremes that people go to for their own ideology.\u201d",
      "DiCaprio portrays Bob Ferguson, known in the French 75\u2019s initial scenes as Ghetto Pat, known for his knowledge of explosives and undying devotion to both Perfidia and the revolution. Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of moments where I was like, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m gonna be able to do this, but thankfully I had amazing scene partners and a great support system to kind of assure me that I was here to do my job and I knew exactly that I could do it,\u201d Infiniti said.",
      "\u201cOne Battle After Another\u201d is Anderson\u2019s most expensive project to date and shot entirely in VistaVision \u2014 a decades-old format that's been revived in recent years by movies like \u201cThe Brutalist.\u201d",

      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",

At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "Alessandro Dell'Acqua's No. 21 collection for next spring and summer focuses on lightness",
      "MILAN -- Alessandro Dell'Acqua's No. 21 collection for next spring and summer, presented Wednesday during Milan Fashion Week, is a study in lightness, as a hedge against the heavy times.",
      "\u201cI believe that in moments of heaviness and uncertainty, sometimes taking a moment of lightheartedness and clearing your mind a bit can be good for you,'' Dell'Acqua said backstage. \u201dThis is why I made it so light.\"",
      "Nowhere was the concept more at play than in chiffon petal cutouts that were sewn together in ruffles on dresses, or as a collar around the neck, rustling delicately with the movement. Dell'Acqua also created wilted flowers out of chiffon that he pinned on garments, \u201cas if forgotten by time.\u201d",
      "The lightness allowed Dell'Acqua to layer amply. Plaid kilts were underpinned by petticoat layers. Prairie skirts with a big hem ruffle were tied prettily at the waist. Silken slip dresses were worn one atop the other.",

      "A Seattle-area nonprofit group called Community Loaves donates home-baked bread and cookies to food banks in four states",
      "On a recent Saturday near Seattle, Cheryl Ewaldsen pulled three golden loaves of wheat bread out of her kitchen oven.",
      "The fragrant, oat-topped bread was destined not for her table, but for a local food bank, to be distributed to families increasingly struggling with hunger and the high cost of groceries.",
      "\u201cI just get really excited about it knowing that it\u2019s going to someone and they\u2019re going to make, like, 10 sandwiches,\u201d said Ewaldsen, 75, a retired university human resources director.",
      "Ewaldsen is a volunteer with Community Loaves, a Seattle-area nonprofit that started pairing home bakers with food pantries during the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 and hasn\u2019t stopped.",
      "Since 2020, the organization headed by Katherine Kehrli, the former dean of a culinary school, has donated more than 200,000 loaves of fresh bread and some 220,000 energy cookies to food banks. They come from a network of nearly 900 bakers in four states \u2014 Washington, Oregon, California and Idaho \u2014 and represent one of the largest such efforts in the country.",
      "Now, amid rising grocery prices and federal cuts to food aid for low-income people, demand for the group's donations of nutritious baked goods is greater than ever, Kehrli said.",
      "\u201cMost of our food banks do not get any kind of whole-grain sandwich bread donation,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we ask what we could do better, they just say, \u2018Bring us more.\u2019\u201d",
      "Ewaldsen\u2019s bread goes to the nearby Edmonds Food Bank, where the client list has swelled from 350 households to nearly 1,000 in the past three years, according to program manager Lester Almanza.",
      "Nationwide, more than 50 million people a year receive charitable food assistance, according to Feeding America, a hunger relief organization.",
      "Anti-hunger experts say they expect the need to rise as recent federal legislation sharply cutting food aid to poor people takes effect. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the tax and spending cuts bill Republicans muscled through Congress in July means 3 million people would not qualify for food stamps, also known as SNAP benefits.",
      "Gauging the impact, however, could soon be more difficult after the U.S. Agriculture Department recently said it would halt an annual report on hunger in America, saying it was redundant, costly and politicized \u201csubjective liberal fodder.\u201d After 30 years, the 2024 report, to be released on Oct. 22, will be the last, the agency said.",
      "\u201cEnding data collection will not end hunger, it will only make it a hidden crisis that is easier to ignore and more difficult to address,\u201d Crystal FitzSimons, president of the Food Research & Action Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement.",
      "Almanza said federal funding for his food bank has dropped at least 10% this year, meaning that every donation helps.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that a lot of people rely on,\u201d he said.",
      "That includes people like Chris Redfearn, 42, and his wife, Melanie Rodriguez-Redfearn, 43, who turned to a food bank in Everett, Washington, last spring after moving to the area to find work. They had to stretch their savings until she began a new position this month teaching history at a local college. Chris Redfearn, who has worked for decades in business, is still looking.",
      "\u201cThe food pantry assists with anywhere from $40 to $80 worth of savings weekly,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to keep ourselves afloat.\u201d",
      "Finding homemade bread from Community Loaves at a food pantry was a surprise, the couple said. Often, surplus bread sent by grocery stores includes highly processed white breads or sweets donated near their expiration or sell-by dates.",

      "The notion of donating home-baked bread came to Kehrli, 61, during the pandemic, when she was displaced from her job at the busy Seattle Culinary Academy.",
      "\u201cI love to bake and just an idea sparked: Would it be possible for us to help from our home and get important valuable nutrition to our food banks?\u201d she recalled.",
      "Many food pantries don\u2019t accept or distribute donations of homemade baked goods. Feeding America warns individual bakers against the practice, saying \u201csince food banks can\u2019t confirm how your baked goods were made or their ingredients, they can\u2019t be donated.\"",
      "But health department rules vary by state, Kehrli learned. In Washington and the other three states where Community Loaves now operates, bread is one of the few foods allowed to be donated from a home kitchen through a program like theirs.",
      "\u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be able to donate custard pies. We wouldn\u2019t be able to donate lasagna,\u201d Kehrli said. \u201cBut bread is deemed safe. Anything that is fully baked and does not require refrigeration.\u201d",
      "Still, Community Loaves bakers must follow approved recipes for the bread and two types of energy cookies. They obtain flour from common sources, and bake and deliver on a shared schedule twice a month.",
      "The bakers buy their own supplies, donating the cost of the ingredients as well as their time. Most make a few loaves per baking session before delivering them to local \u201chubs,\u201d where other volunteers collect the bread and transport it to the food banks.",
      "Bakers range from former professionals to beginners. A robust website with recipes and how-to videos backstops every step, Kehrli said.",
      "Baking the bread is satisfying on several levels, said Ewaldsen, who has donated nearly 800 loaves in less than two years. Part of it is addressing the physical need for food, but part is also addressing the spiritual hunger for connection with neighbors.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the opportunity for me to bake something and to share something with others in the community, where they don\u2019t necessarily need to know who I am, but they know that there\u2019s a community that loves and cares for them,\u201d she said.",
      "While such sentiments are sincere and admirable, anti-hunger experts stress that individual donations can't take the place of adequately funded government services for struggling Americans.",
      "\u201cIt's beautiful that our communities act this way,\u201d said Gina Plata-Nino of the Food Research & Action Center. \u201cBut it is a loaf of bread. That is going to feed one person \u2014 and there are millions in line.\"",

      "As mental health chatbots driven by artificial intelligence proliferate, a small number of states are trying to regulate them",
      "In the absence of stronger federal regulation, some states have begun regulating apps that offer AI \u201ctherapy\u201d as more people turn to artificial intelligence for mental health advice.",
      "But the laws, all passed this year, don't fully address the fast-changing landscape of AI software development. And app developers, policymakers and mental health advocates say the resulting patchwork of state laws isn't enough to protect users or hold the creators of harmful technology accountable.",
      "\u201cThe reality is millions of people are using these tools and they\u2019re not going back,\u201d said Karin Andrea Stephan, CEO and co-founder of the mental health chatbot app Earkick.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE \u2014 This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "___",
      "The state laws take different approaches. Illinois and Nevada have banned the use of AI to treat mental health. Utah placed certain limits on therapy chatbots, including requiring them to protect users\u2019 health information and to clearly disclose that the chatbot isn\u2019t human. Pennsylvania, New Jersey and California are also considering ways to regulate AI therapy.",
      "The impact on users varies. Some apps have blocked access in states with bans. Others say they're making no changes as they wait for more legal clarity.",
      "And many of the laws don't cover generic chatbots like ChatGPT, which are not explicitly marketed for therapy but are used by an untold number of people for it. Those bots have attracted lawsuits in horrific instances where users lost their grip on reality or took their own lives after interacting with them.",
      "Vaile Wright, who oversees health care innovation at the American Psychological Association, agreed that the apps could fill a need, noting a nationwide shortage of mental health providers, high costs for care and uneven access for insured patients.",
      "Mental health chatbots that are rooted in science, created with expert input and monitored by humans could change the landscape, Wright said.",
      "\u201cThis could be something that helps people before they get to crisis,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what\u2019s on the commercial market currently.\u201d",
      "That's why federal regulation and oversight is needed, she said.",
      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",

She studies the weekly inventory from Good Shepherd, Maine\u2019s only food bank, for good deals on butter and cheese.",
      "Every Monday morning, she shops at three different stores, keeping lists of prices in her head and remembering what particular clients want. On a recent trip to Sam\u2019s Club, she was searching for affordable eggs.",

      "The eggs were destined for Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard, the food pantry in Winterport, Maine, that Allen has helped run for the past 17 years. Every Wednesday, she and a tightknit group of volunteers provide 25 to 30 families with heaping bags of food.",
      "Maine has long been one of the most food insecure states in New England. Directors of food pantries say the task of making sure people are fed is getting harder because of diminishing food supplies, increasing demand and an overwhelming reliance on volunteers, many of whom are retirees with ages up into their 80s.",
      "About one in seven people in rural Waldo County, where Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard is, were food insecure in 2023, a rate that was similar to the state and national average, according to an Associated Press analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and Feeding America data.",

      "Charitable food networks are also bracing for $186 billion in cuts for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), the federal low-income nutrition program better known as food stamps. In turn, Feeding America predicts that food pantries will see more demand.",
      "Complicating matters is the infrastructure through which the U.S. distributes most food to those who need help. In Maine, the nearly 600 hunger relief agencies that get free and low-cost food from Good Shepherd Food Bank rely on volunteers. This includes 250 food pantries as well as soup kitchens, senior centers, shelters, schools and youth programs.",
      "More than 75% of these organizations rely completely on volunteers, with no paid staff, according to Good Shepherd.",

It shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d",
      "Neighbor\u2019s Cupboard hummed with activity on a recent Wednesday morning, cans stacked in piles six feet high and children\u2019s collages taped to a cooler.",
      "Keith Ritchie was greeting clients \u2014 and keeping a gentle eye out to make sure no one took more than their fair share of limited foods. At 89, he is the pantry\u2019s oldest worker, although Betty Williams, 88, teases him about who\u2019s older.",
      "In more than 17 years of service, Ritchie said, \u201cI\u2019ve only missed twice.\u201d He drives 20 miles (32 kilometers) each way to dole out groceries and fill bags with \u201csurprises\u201d \u2013 donated items like Girl Scout cookies.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

The administrative portion declined more recently, from 96.5% in fiscal year 2023 to 58.8% in fiscal year 2024. It is expected to drop more in 2025.",
      "Nearly 90% of spending has been federal money, and Georgia used $20 million in other federal grants to help implement the program.",
      "Opponents, including Democratic U.S. Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, deride Pathways as festooned in red tape while funneling money to the private consulting firm that runs it. In a Thursday statement, Warnock said that \u201cthe only thing Pathways is incredibly effective at is barring working people from health coverage and making corporate consultants richer.\"",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision will continue to keep health care away from Georgians who need it most. It is wrong, it is immoral, and it only makes our country sicker and poorer,\u201d Warnock continued.",

      "Health authorities and organizations say they lack funds to respond to a deadly Ebola outbreak in southern Congo",
      "GOMA, Congo -- As a deadly new Ebola outbreak kills dozens in southern Congo, health authorities and organizations are sounding the alarm, warning they lack the funds and resources to mount an effective response to the crisis.",
      "The World Health Organization said Wednesday that 57 cases and 35 deaths have been reported since the outbreak was announced by Congolese authorities on Sept. 4. The fatality rate is over 61%.",
      "It is the first Ebola outbreak in 18 years in Kasai province, a remote part of Congo characterized by its poor road networks. It is located more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from the nation\u2019s capital of Kinshasa.",
      "\u201cWe urgently need our partners and donors to step up and support this lifesaving response to ensure we can contain the outbreak quickly and protect the most vulnerable communities,\u201d said Susan Nzisa Mbalu, head of communications for the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies Africa, IFRC.",
      "Earlier this week, the IFRC said it is appealing for 20 million Swiss francs ($25 million) to help contain the outbreak and aiming to reach 965,000 people with urgent assistance. It warned that health facilities are overwhelmed and lack the resources to provide care, with clean water and protective equipment running critically low.",
      "According to the IFRC, the only treatment centre in the Bulape health zone, where the epicenter of the outbreak has been declared and the majority of cases are concentrated, is already at 119% capacity.",
      "Health officials are particularly concerned about the impact of U.S. funding cuts, especially since the U.S. has a history of supporting Congo\u2019s past Ebola outbreaks, including a 2021 effort when the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, provided up to $11.5 million to support efforts across Africa.",
      "IFRC\u2019s Nzisa Mbalu said it is still early to fully assess the level of donor support for the Ebola response, adding that the organization has so far allocated 1.75 million swiss francs ($2.2 million) in emergency funds to respond to the outbreak.",
      "Despite the absence of USAID, Mathias Mossoko, the Ebola Response Coordinator in Bulape, said that the U.S. government has provided \u201csome small support,\u201d though he could not provide specific details.",
      "WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told the AP on Thursday that the organization\u2019s only current funding for the outbreak response is a $2 million emergency fund and around $2.3 million from the United Kingdom, Germany, and the Gavi vaccine alliance.",
      "That is far below the WHO\u2019s projected cost of around $20 million to respond to the outbreak over the next three months.",
      "\u201cWithout immediate support, gaps in operations will persist, jeopardizing efforts to contain the outbreak and protect vulnerable communities,\u201d Jasarevic said.",
      "The Congolese authorities\u2019 current national response plan is estimated at $78 million.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin will stop scheduling patients for abortions starting next week as it works to find a way to provide the service in the face of Medicaid funding cuts in President Donald Trump's tax and spending bill, the nonprofit said Thursday.",
      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",
      "It is also considering taking legal action, the group said.",
      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills. Prescribers in states where they\u2019re allowed have been shipping the pills to places where abortion is banned, a practice that is facing some legal challenges and is expected to attract more.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provisional data for 2024 showed a third consecutive year of fewer gonorrhea cases, and the second year in a row of fewer adult cases of chlamydia and the most infectious forms of syphilis.",
      "But congenital syphilis cases, in which infected moms pass the disease to their babies, aren't seeing the same improvements. Such infections in infants can lead to deaths or lifelong health problems such as deafness, blindness, and malformed bones.",
      "The number and rate of newborn cases has been rising since 2012, when about 300 were reported, and last year rose to nearly 4,000. The 2024 increases was not as steep as in other years \u2014 cases were up by less than 2% from 2023. But health experts say no cases should be happening, and any growth is worrisome.",
      "\"The continued rise in congenital syphilis is a distressing indication that we are not doing enough to protect pregnant women and newborns,\" said Elizabeth Finley, interim executive director of the National Coalition of STD Directors, in a statement.",
      "About 1.5 million chlamydia cases, 543,000 of gonorrhea, and more than 190,000 of syphilis were diagnosed and reported last year. Each was lower than the year before, and the more than 2.2 million total cases represented a 9% decline from 2023.",

      "Later in life, after she married, she was unable to have children.",
      "At a ceremony in Greenland 's capital of Nuuk on Wednesday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart Jens-Frederik Nielsen will offer their official apologies for their governments' roles in the mistreatment of Greenlandic Indigenous girls and women who were given invasive contraception by the Danish health authorities against their will, with cases dating back to the 1960s.",
      "\u201cWe cannot change what has happened, but we can take responsibility and we can create the conditions for reconciliation with the past,\u201d Frederiksen said in a statement released Monday, adding the Danish government intends to establish a reconciliation fund to financially compensate victims.",

      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies.

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- On a visit to New Zealand, FBI Director Kash Patel gave the country\u2019s police and spy bosses gifts of inoperable pistols that were illegal to possess under local gun laws and had to be destroyed, New Zealand law enforcement agencies told The Associated Press.",
      "The plastic 3D-printed replica pistols formed part of display stands Patel presented to at least three senior New Zealand security officials in July. Patel, the most senior Trump administration official to visit the country so far, was in Wellington to open the FBI\u2019s first standalone office in New Zealand.",
      "Pistols are tightly restricted weapons under New Zealand law and possessing one requires an additional permit beyond a regular gun license. Law enforcement agencies didn\u2019t specify whether the officials who met with Patel held such permits, but they couldn\u2019t have legally kept the gifts if they didn\u2019t.",
      "It wasn't clear what permissions Patel had sought to bring the weapons into the country. A spokesperson for Patel told the AP Tuesday that the FBI would not comment.",
      "Inoperable weapons are treated as though they\u2019re operable in New Zealand if modifications could make them workable again. The pistols were judged by gun regulators to be potentially operable and were destroyed, New Zealand\u2019s Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told AP in a statement Tuesday.",
      "Chambers didn\u2019t specify how the weapons had been rendered inoperable before Patel gifted them. Usually this means the temporary disabling of the gun\u2019s firing mechanism.",
      "Three of New Zealand\u2019s most powerful law enforcement figures said they received the gifts at meetings July 31. Chambers was one recipient, and the other two were Andrew Hampton, Director-General of the country\u2019s human intelligence agency NZSIS, and Andrew Clark, Director-General of the technical intelligence agency GCSB, according to a joint statement from their departments.",
      "A spokesperson for the spy agencies described the gift as \u201ca challenge coin display stand\u201d that included the 3D-printed inoperable weapon \u201cas part of the design.\u201d The officials sought advice on the gifts the next day from the regulator that enforces New Zealand\u2019s gun laws, Chambers said.",
      "When the weapons were examined, it was discovered they were potentially operable.",
      "\u201cTo ensure compliance with firearms laws, I instructed Police to retain and destroy them,\u201d Chambers said.",
      "James Davidson, a former FBI agent who is now president of the FBI Integrity Project, a nonprofit that seeks to safeguard the bureau from undue partisan influence, has criticized Patel's appointment.",
      "But Davidson said the gift of the replica pistols appeared \u201ca genuine gesture\u201d from Patel and their destruction was \u201cquite frankly, an overreaction by the NZSIS, which could have simply rendered the replica inoperable,\u201d he said.",

The comments prompted polite dismissal from officials in Wellington, who said the bolstered FBI presence was primarily to collaborate on child exploitation and drug smuggling crimes.

If she had been denied bail, she would have been immediately removed from her position as an elected Member of Parliament.",
      "The court\u2019s action, though expected, underlines that Thailand's machinery of state remains deeply conservative, despite a recent change of government and the opposition People\u2019s Party\u2019s standing as the biggest party in Parliament. Thailand\u2019s political establishment is sensitive about any perceived threats to the status of the country\u2019s monarchy.",
      "Other recent appeals involving political activists have seen rulings that reversed the acquittal of lower courts or handed down longer prison sentences.",
      "Chonthicha\u2019s case is related to a speech she gave during a 2021 political rally in which she demanded the release of all political prisoners. She was found guilty for parts of the speech alleging that the then-government, led by Prayuth Chan-ocha, changed a law to give more power to King Maha Vajiralongkorn.",

Earlier this month, she was convicted in a separate case by the Bangkok Criminal Court and sentenced to two years and eight months in prison for an online post in 2020 that also concerned royal privileges.",
      "Before being elected to Parliament in 2023, Chonthicha was a high-profile activist in the youth-dominated pro-democracy movement, which demanded democratic reform of several powerful institutions, including the monarchy.",

      "\u201cBritain stands at a fork in the road. We can choose decency or we can choose division. Renewal or decline,\u201d Starmer will say, according to his office.",
      "Since Labour won a landslide election victory in July 2024, its popularity has plummeted. The party promised economic growth, but has struggled to deliver it. Inflation remains stubbornly high and the economic outlook subdued, frustrating efforts to repair tattered public services and ease the cost of living.",
      "Treasury chief Rachel Reeves said Monday that wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have caused \u201charsh global headwinds,\u201d and hard economic choices loom when she sets out her budget in November.",
      "Against that gloomy backdrop, Labour\u2019s annual conference in Liverpool \u2013 motto: \u201cRenew Britain\u201d \u2013 has been dominated by conversations about how to fight Reform. Farage\u2019s party has topped opinion polls for months, ahead of both Labour and the main opposition Conservatives, despite holding just five of the 650 seats in the House of Commons.",
      "Farage\u2019s anti-establishment, anti-immigration message, with its echoes of Trump\u2019s MAGA movement, has homed in on the issue of thousands of migrants in small boats arriving in Britain across the English Channel. More than 30,000 people have made the dangerous crossing from France so far this year despite efforts by authorities in Britain, France and other countries to crack down on people-smuggling gangs.",
      "Farage has vowed to deport everyone arriving by small boat and go even farther, stripping the right to remain in the U.K. from many legal residents.",
      "Starmer said on the weekend that such a policy would be \u201cracist\u201d and \u201cimmoral,\u201d and he has accused Farage of nurturing a \u201cpolitics of grievance\u201d that turns people against one another. He has expressed alarm that a march organized by anti-immigration campaigner and convicted fraudster Tommy Robinson attracted more than 100,000 people in London this month.",
      "Starmer will warn in his speech that the path to renewal is \u201clong, it\u2019s difficult, it requires decisions that are not cost-free or easy.",
      "\u201cIt is a test,\u201d he plans to say. \u201cA fight for the soul of our country, every bit as big as rebuilding Britain after the war, and we must all rise to this challenge.\u201d",

      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., ruled that the U.S. Agency for Global Media cannot implement a reduction in force eliminating 532 jobs for full-time government employees on Tuesday. Those employees represent the vast majority of its remaining staff.",
      "Kari Lake, the agency\u2019s acting CEO, announced in late August that the job cuts would take effect Tuesday. But the judge's ruling preserves the status quo at the agency until he rules on a plaintiffs' underlying motion to block the reduction in force.",
      "Lamberth previously ruled that President Donald Trump\u2019s Republican administration must restore VOA programming to levels commensurate with its statutory mandate to \u201cserve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news.\u201d He also blocked Lake from removing Michael Abramowitz as VOA\u2019s director.",
      "Lamberth accused the administration of showing \u201cconcerning disrespect\u201d toward the court in response to his earlier orders to produce information about its plans for Voice of America. He noted that the agency initiated the job cuts only hours after a hearing last month in which government lawyers said a reduction in force, or RIF, was merely a possibility.",
      "\u201cThe defendants\u2019 obfuscation of this Court\u2019s request for information regarding whether their RIF plans comported with the preliminary injunction has wasted precious judicial time and resources and readily support contempt proceedings,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "But he said he wouldn\u2019t initiate contempt proceedings on his own because the plaintiffs haven\u2019t sought it yet.",
      "\u201cHowever, (the court\u2019s) deference to the plaintiffs with respect to further proceedings should not be mistaken for lenience toward the defendants\u2019 egregious erstwhile conduct,\u201d he added.",
      "Employees who sued to block the dismantling of Voice of America claimed the planned cuts would hamper the judge\u2019s ability to enforce the injunction he issued in April. \u201cThis Court should therefore preserve the status quo while the parties litigate compliance,\u201d their attorneys wrote.",
      "Government lawyers accused the plaintiffs of impermissibly trying to micromanage the agency\u2019s operations. \u201cEnjoining the reductions in force would be a wholly overbroad and improper remedy,\u201d they wrote.",

    "story": [
      "New rules that limit the access of journalists in the Pentagon and appear to condition entry into the building on agreement to restrictions have led to a standoff between the press and the Trump administration's defense department",
      "Journalists who cover the Pentagon and the Trump admnistration are in a standoff about new rules that limit the access of the media to most areas within the Pentagon and appear to condition overall entry to the building on an agreement to restrictions in reporting.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's team characterizes the changes as an effort to protect national security and the safety of those who work at the Pentagon, while many in the press see it as an effort to exert control and avoid embarrassing stories.",
      "Journalists who want to hold on to badges that permit access to the Pentagon were told on Sept. 19 they must sign a letter acknowledging the new rules by this Tuesday or the badge \u201cwill be revoked.\u201d The new policy says that Defense Department information \u201cmust be approved for public release by an appropriate authorizing official before it is released, even if unclassified.\u201d Classified material faces even tighter restrictions.",
      "That level of control immediately alarmed journalists and their advocates.",
      "\u201cAsking independent journalists to submit to these kinds of restrictions is at stark odds with the constitutional protections of a free press in a democracy, and a continued attempt to throttle the public's right to understand what their government is doing,\u201d said Charles Stadtlander, spokesman for The New York Times.",
      "In a subsequent letter to the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Hegseth aide Sean Parnell suggested that journalists misunderstood some of the new rules. He said, for example, that the restriction against releasing unclassified information is the policy that Pentagon officials must follow \u2014 not something the journalists must abide by.",
      "\u201cIt should come as no surprise that the mainstream media is once again misrepresenting the Pentagon's press procedures,\u201d Parnell said in a post on X. \u201cLet's be absolutely clear: Journalists are not required to clear their stories with us. That claim is a lie.\u201d",
      "However, the new policy says that journalists who encourage Pentagon officials to break the rules \u2014 in other words, ask sources for information \u2014 could be subject to losing their building access.",
      "While it appeared that Parnell sought to soften some of the hard edges of his policy in response to questions raised by the reporters' committee, there's still enough confusion to merit a meeting to clear things up, said Grayson Clary, a lawyer for RCFP. There's some wariness among news organizations about what they would be agreeing to if they sign the letter, and it's not clear how many people \u2014 if any \u2014 have done so.",
      "The new rules continue a tense relationship between the press and the Hegseth team, which had already evicted some news outlets from their regular workspaces in favor of friendlier outlets and limited the ability of reporters to roam around the Pentagon. Hegseth and Parnell seldom hold press briefings.",
      "Parnell did not respond to a request for comment by The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cIt's control, just 100% control,\u201d said Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of The Atlantic magazine. Goldberg, who is not stationed at the Pentagon, wrote the most embarrassing story of Hegseth's tenure so far when he was inadvertently included in a Signal group chat where Hegseth and other national officials discussed an imminent attack on Houthis in Yemen. The brouhaha became widely known as \u201cSignalgate.\u201d",
      "Pentagon leadership was also reportedly unhappy over a story that said Elon Musk was to get a briefing on military strategy for China, leading President Donald Trump to stop it, and other stories about initial assessments of damage in the military strike against Iran.",
      "No American reporter accredited to the Pentagon that he knows is interested in subverting national security or putting anyone in the military in harm's way, Goldberg said.",
      "In his own case, Goldberg did not report on what he learned until after the attack was over. He said he contacted officials in the group chat to ask if there was anything he learned that was harmful to the country in any way. He did not include in his story the name of a CIA official mentioned in the messages who was technically still undercover, he said.",
      "\u201cThe only people in Signalgate who were putting American troops in harm's way were the national leadership of the United States by discussing on a commercial messaging app the launch times of strikes on a hostile country,\u201d he said.",

With the exception of a few areas, reporters are not permitted under the new rules to walk through the Pentagon without an official escort.",
      "Priest said the corridors of the Pentagon were like areas around Congress where reporters buttonhole politicians. Priest recalled staking out military officials waiting for them to come out of a bathroom.",

      "CSX railroad replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs",
      "CSX railroad announced Monday that it had replaced its CEO less than two months after an investment fund urged it to either find another railroad to merge with to better compete with the proposed transcontinental Union Pacific railroad or fire outgoing CEO Joe Hinrichs.",
      "The outgoing CEO, who came to the railroad in 2022 after a long career with Ford, focused on repairing CSX's relationship with its workers and labor unions and unifying the team after a bitter contract fight. But Ancora Holdings, which helped spur major changes at Norfolk Southern, said CSX's operating performance deteriorated significantly under Hinrichs' leadership. Hinrichs resigned to clear the way for Steve Angel to become CEO effective Sunday.",
      "Angel, 70, also comes from outside the rail industry although earlier in his career he oversaw GE's locomotive building unit, so he does have that experience. CSX said he has 45 years experience leading large public companies, including most recently as CEO of Linde and Praxair that provide industrial gasses to other companies.",
      "\u201cWe are excited to welcome Steve as our new CEO. He is a visionary in creating long-term value and an expert in guiding companies through significant transformation,\" the railroad's board Chairman John Zillmer said.",
      "CSX has been under pressure from Ancora and other investors since Union Pacific announced its $85 billion deal to acquire Norfolk Southern, which is CSX's rival in the eastern United States. But both BNSF and CPKC railroads said they aren't interested in a merger right now.",
      "Ancora said CSX has delivered disappointing shareholder returns and poor financial performance during Hinrichs' tenure. But over the past year, CSX was working on two major construction projects \u2014 repairs from Hurricane Helene and a major tunnel renovation in Baltimore \u2014 that disrupted the railroad. Both those projects were just completed this month, so CSX's performance was expected to improve in the fourth quarter.",
      "Even though he's not a railroader, Ancora praised Angel's hiring because of his experience with mergers and acquisitions. The top executives at Ancora, Frederick D. DiSanto and James Chadwick, said in their statement that they believe Hinrichs \u201cbotched the opportunity\u201d to merge with another railroad and may have even fought the idea. They said Angel is expected to be more aggressive at pursuing a deal and that he will re-evaluate the railroad's leadership team.",
      "\u201cWith President Donald Trump and other policymakers recently expressing enthusiasm for the benefits of a transcontinental railroad, CSX and other Class I railroads have no choice but to embrace the industry\u2019s new realities,\u201d the Ancora executives said. \u201cAlthough Steve Angel is not a railroader by trade, his M&A pedigree and value creation record indicate his appointment is an initial step in the right direction for CSX.\u201d",
      "Angel promised to make improvements at the Jacksonville, Florida-based company, which is one of the six largest railroads in North America.",

      "\u201cMy top priorities will be to ensure the safety of the railroad and our employees, deliver reliable service to our customers, and increase value for our shareholders,\u201d Angel said in a statement.",
      "Angel will earn a $1.5 million salary, but he will also be eligible for a performance stock grant targeted at $13.5 million next year if CSX hits certain performance goals. He will also receive a separate $10 million stock grant that will vest after three years based on performance. Angel will also be eligible to collect retirement from the railroad after three years. CSX also outlined a separate agreement that would pay Angel triple his salary and target bonus in the event of another railroad taking control of CSX.",
      "Ancora said it continues to buy more CSX shares and hopes to develop a better relationship with the railroad. Ancora holds three seats on Norfolk Southern's board after running a proxy campaign there to oust the previous CEO at that railroad, so the investment fund had input on the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Emily Nasseff Mitsch said Angel\u2019s experience overseeing the complex merger of Linde and Praxair should give CSX a strategic edge in any potential rail consolidation.",
      "Most observers believe CSX and BNSF will be at a disadvantage if the Union Pacific-Norfolk Southern merger gets approved. That transcontinental railroad will be able to shave more than a day off delivery times because it won\u2019t have to hand off shipments between railroads in the middle of the country. So far, those railroads have said they believe they could achieve most of the benefits of a merger through cooperative agreements.",
      "\u201cAngel brings exceptional credentials from 22 years at GE\u2019s locomotive operations and demonstrated value creation, generating over 200% returns at Linde and Praxair while executing major industrial mergers. We believe this positions CSX for its next growth phase,\u201d Mitsch said.",

But levels of the chemical are very low, essentially a microdose compared to what\u2019s available in gummies, chocolate bars and other products sold at marijuana dispensaries in the U.S. The company said patients in the trial didn\u2019t show any signs of drug abuse, dependence or withdrawal.",
      "Driving is not recommended during the first few weeks of taking the drug, although the company said the decision of whether to drive was ultimately left to patients.",
      "Vertanical is seeking approval for a large group of patients: those suffering from lower-back pain, a chronic condition that affects millions and has few proven treatments.",
      "Over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen can\u2019t be used for long-term pain because of their side effects, which include stomach ulcers and indigestion. Opioids are no longer recommended, after the overprescribing of painkillers such as OxyContin in the 1990s and 2000s led to the ongoing epidemic of addiction to that class of drug.",
      "Chronic pain is one of the most frequently cited conditions of people enrolled in state-run medical marijuana programs. But there's been little rigorous research on the drug's use in that group.",
      "Lead study author Dr. Matthias Karst said in an email that the new findings show cannabis \"can significantly reduce pain and improve physical function in patients with chronic low-back pain, without the safety concerns commonly associated with opioids.\u201d Karst is a pain specialist at Hannover Medical School and a consultant for Vertanical.",

      "So you're booking your flight, and just when you're about to check out, the airline asks if you'd like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight's pollution. Or, maybe you're an environmentally minded person, and you've heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.",
      "Are they worth it? Let's explore.",
      "A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That's about the amount of pollution you'd save if you swore off meat for 17 months.",
      "Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space \u2014 additional warming that isn't typically included in a flight's emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.",
      "Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel \u2014 biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel \u2014 is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.",
      "\u201cAviation is the problem child,\u201d Vitry said. \u201cAviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.\u201d",
      "That's where carbon offsets come in.",
      "A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It's connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions \u2014 for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.",
      "The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).",
      "They've gotten popular enough that there's an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.",

      "Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn\u2019t stop your flight's emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can't possible absorb all the emissions it's supposed to.",

      "She said that\u2019s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it\u2019s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. \u201cThe buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,\u201d Haya said.",
      "Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don't say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project.

      "WASHINGTON -- Party leaders in Congress have long criticized government shutdowns as toxic and destructive.",
      "\u201cAlways a bad idea,\u201d former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said of shutdowns in 2024. A potential \u201cdisaster,\u201d Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said of the shutdown the country narrowly avoided when he voted with Republicans to keep the government open in March.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think shutdowns benefit anybody, least of all the American people,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said last week.",
      "Yet Congress often finds itself at the brink of one as the two major political parties\u2019 differences grow more intractable with each passing year. Democrats are threatening to vote against keeping the government open on Oct. 1.",
      "Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., say they won\u2019t budge unless Republicans immediately extend health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year, among other demands. Republicans say they don\u2019t want to add any complicated policy to their \u201cclean\u201d stopgap bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks.",
      "Time and time again, lawmakers hold out until just before the deadline and negotiate a last-minute compromise. But this time Democrats see some potential political advantages to a shutdown with their base voters spoiling for a fight.",
      "History shows the tactic almost never works, and federal employees are caught in the middle. The White House has already laid out a plan to potentially lay off hundreds, if not thousands, of federal employees \u2014 a significant escalation from previous shutdowns in which federal workers were temporarily furloughed and given back pay when the standoff ended.",
      "A look at some previous shutdowns and how they ended:",
      "Two years into his first term, President Donald Trump led the country into its longest shutdown ever with demands that Congress give him money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. Similar to Republican leaders today, then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, refused to negotiate unless Trump, a Republican, allowed the government to reopen. Democrats had won the House majority in the 2018 election and took power in the middle of the partial shutdown.",
      "Trump retreated after 35 days as intensifying delays at the nation\u2019s airports and another missed payday for hundreds of thousands of federal workers brought new urgency to efforts to resolve the standoff.",
      "The government shut down for three days as Democrats insisted that any budget measure come with protections for young immigrants known as \u201cDreamers.\u201d Trump refused to negotiate until the government reopened, and the weekend shutdown ended after McConnell, then the Senate majority leader, promised a vote on the issue.",

      "The conflict escalated when House Republicans also blocked the needed approval for raising the amount of money the Treasury can borrow to pay U.S. bills, raising the specter of a catastrophic default. Obama, a Democrat, vowed repeatedly not to pay a \u201cransom\u201d to get Congress to pass normally routine legislation.",
      "Bipartisan negotiations in the Senate finally ended the shutdown, and Republicans did not win any major concessions on health care. \u201cWe fought the good fight. We just didn\u2019t win,\u201d then-House Speaker John Boehner conceded.",
      "Intent on slashing the budget, Republicans led by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich forced a three-week shutdown from December 1995 to January 1996 in a bid to coerce President Bill Clinton to sign onto a balanced budget agreement. Republicans were saddled with the blame, and Clinton, a Democrat, was reelected that November.",
      "Under Presidents Jimmy Carter, a Democrat, and Ronald Reagan, a Republican, there were short shutdowns almost every year. The longest was in 1978, for 17 days.",
      "A series of legal opinions issued in 1980 and 1981 made shutdowns more impactful. Then-Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti determined that failure to pass new spending bills required government functioning to shut down in whole or in part. Earlier \u201cshutdowns\u201d did not always entail an actual stop to government functioning and often were simply funding gaps will little real-world effect.",

      "Albertsons Companies has recalled several deli products due to potential listeria contamination",
      "NEW YORK -- Albertsons Companies has recalled several of its store-made deli products because they may contain listeria bacteria, in a move that arrives shortly after federal health officials warned consumers to not eat certain pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe\u2019s over similar contamination concerns.",
      "The Boise, Idaho-based supermarket giant on Saturday said it was pulling five deli items because they contain a recalled bowtie pasta ingredient made by Nate\u2019s Fine Foods. Albertsons is urging consumers to not eat these products \u2014 which were supplied by refrigerated goods distributor Fresh Creative Foods \u2014 and is instructing those impacted to throw them away or initiate a return at their local store for a full refund.",
      "The products under recall include certain ready-to-eat basil pesto pasta salad offerings, as well as pasta dishes with chicken, spinach and other ingredients. Consumers can determine if an item they bought is impacted by looking at the list of product names, sell thru dates and other identifying information on Albertsons' website.",
      "The recalled items were sold in various Albertsons-owned stores \u2014 including Albertsons Market, Safeway and Von's \u2014 across more than a dozen states.",
      "\u201cListeria monocytogenes can survive in refrigerated temperatures and can easily spread to other foods and surfaces,\u201d Albertsons warned in its release. The company also noted that the FDA instructs consumers to be extra vigilant when cleaning any surfaces or containers that may have come into contact with products recalled for possible listeria contamination.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to Nate\u2019s Fine Foods in California and Fresh Creative Foods, a division of Oregon-based Reser\u2019s Fine Foods, for further statements on Sunday.",
      "Albertsons on Saturday said that there had been no reports of injuries or illnesses related to its recalled products. But the company's recall comes amid wider warnings from U.S. health officials about potential listeria contamination in ready-made meals sold by other retailers, some of which have previously been linked to a deadly outbreak.",

And it\u2019s a job that pays well, and it pays well for a reason. You\u2019re interacting with the community with large numbers of people. You have a large number of associates.

      "Russia has launched a major drone and missile attack on Ukraine that killed at least four people",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- KYIV, Ukraine (AP) \u2014 Russia unleashed a barrage of drones and missiles on Ukraine overnight into Sunday, killing at least four people, with Kyiv suffering the heaviest assault. It was the first major bombardment since an air attack on Ukraine's capital left at least 21 people dead last month.",

      "Tymur Tkachenko, head of the Kyiv City Administration, confirmed Sunday's casualties via Telegram and said that 10 others were wounded in the attack, which targeted civilian areas across the city. A 12-year-old girl was among the dead. Thick black smoke could be seen rising from a blast near the city center.",

      "Besides Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the bombardment targeted the regions of Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskyi, Sumy, Mykolaiv, Chernihiv, and Odesa.

      "\u201cThis vile attack came virtually (at) the close of U.N. General Assembly week, and this is exactly how Russia declares its true position. Moscow wants to keep fighting and killing, and it deserves the toughest pressure from the world,\u201d Zelenskyy wrote.",
      "Speaking to Fox News in an interview taped Friday, Vance said the U.S. administration was reviewing a request by the Ukrainian president for Tomahawk cruise missiles. Tomahawks have a range of around 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which would put Moscow within the range of Ukraine's forces.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that the president is going to make the final determination on. I know that we\u2019re reviewing that request. We\u2019re also reviewing a number of other requests,\u201d Vance said.",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- Moldova\u2019s pro-Western ruling party has taken a decisive lead in a critical parliamentary election that was overshadowed by Russian interference claims. The race was widely viewed as a geopolitical choice between a path to the European Union or a drift back into Moscow\u2019s fold.",
      "The tense ballot pitted the governing pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity, which has held a strong parliamentary majority since 2021, against several Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners. But the party now looks on track to secure a majority of legislative seats.",
      "With about 95% of polling station reports counted, official electoral data showed the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity leading with 48% of the vote, while the pro-Russian Patriotic Electoral Bloc has 25.6%. The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc stood at 8.3% and the populist Our Party \u2014 which wants \u201cbalanced foreign policy\u201d between East and West \u2014 has 6.3%. The right-wing Democracy at Home party has 5.7%.",
      "The election day was marked by a string of incidents, ranging from bomb threats at multiple polling stations abroad to cyberattacks on electoral and government infrastructure, voters photographing their ballots and some being illegally transported to polling stations. Police also detained three people suspected of plotting to cause unrest after the vote.",
      "The pivotal vote will elect a new 101-seat parliament, after which Moldova\u2019s president nominates a prime minister, generally from the leading party or bloc, which can then try to form a new government. A proposed government needs parliamentary approval.",
      "When polls closed locally at 9 p.m. on Sunday, the Central Electoral Commission reported that more than 1.59 million, or about 51.9% of eligible voters had cast ballots. Some 276,000 Moldovans have voted in polling stations set up abroad, which will remain open until 7 p.m. in their respective countries.",
      "Moldova\u2019s large diaspora will likely play a decisive role in the final outcome. In last year\u2019s presidential runoff \u2014 which was also viewed as a choice between East and West \u2014 a record number of 327,000 voters cast ballots abroad, more than 82% of whom favored Moldova\u2019s pro-Western President Maia Sandu.",
      "Sunday\u2019s high-stakes ballot was to some extent a litmus test for the Moldovan authorities in countering what they have long alleged is a massive \u201chybrid war\u201d conducted by Russia, which they accused of spending \u201chundreds of millions\u201d of euros to try to seize power in Moldova and ultimately derail the country\u2019s EU path.",

      "\u201cThe consequences of this intervention are hard to estimate at this hour,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are waiting for the election results. We pray for patience and calm.\u201d",
      "Moldova is landlocked between Ukraine and EU member Romania. The country of about 2.5 million people has spent recent years on a westward path and gained candidate status to the EU in 2022, shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Tensions between Russia and Moldova, a Soviet republic until 1991, skyrocketed.",
      "After casting her ballot on Sunday, Sandu reiterated long-held claims that Russia \u201cmassively interfered\u201d in the election, saying she voted \u201cto keep the peace\u201d and insisted her country\u2019s future lies within the EU.",
      "The alleged Russian strategies include a large-scale vote-buying operation, cyberattacks, a plan to incite mass riots around the election and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to diminish support for the pro-European ruling party and sway voters toward Moscow-friendly ones.",
      "Just before the vote, police carried out hundreds of raids, detaining scores of people allegedly trained in Serbia to cause \u201cmass riots\u201d and destabilize the country around the critical election.",

      "Gavin McKenna, a top prospect for the 2026 NHL draft, made headlines in July by leaving the Western Hockey League to play for Penn State",
      "STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- Gavin McKenna admits he didn\u2019t watch a lot of college hockey growing up in Western Canada.",
      "But the projected 2026 NHL draft\u2019s top prospect saw enough last season to know he wanted to play for Penn State.",
      "McKenna met with reporters Monday for the first time since shocking the hockey world in July by announcing his departure from the Western Hockey League to commit to Guy Gadowsky\u2019s Nittany Lions.",
      "\u201cSeeing what these guys did last year, making it to the Frozen Four, that was a big influence on me,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cI wanted to come to a winning team and I thought this was the spot.\u201d",
      "The 17-year-old was already the main man for a winning program.",
      "He finished second in the WHL with 129 points (41 goals, 88 assists) in 56 games last season and was the league\u2019s player of the year. He led the Medicine Hat Tigers to the WHL championship and Memorial Cup finals.",
      "In his three seasons for Medicine Hat, McKenna had 79 goals and 165 assists.",
      "Now he aims to provide even more scoring and playmaking for the Nittany Lions who return their top six scorers from last season\u2019s squad that fell a game short of playing for an NCAA title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s continuing on where we left off and I think Gavin was really adamant about that when coming in and talking about the reasons why,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s here to enhance that, not change that.\u201d",
      "McKenna is joined by new teammates Lev Katzin, Luke Misa and Shea Van Olm, and defensemen Jackson Smith and Nolan Collins who are among the nearly 325 CHL players who have committed to Division I college programs this year.",
      "The NCAA lifted its ban on CHL players in November, paving the way for McKenna and other CHL players \u2014 previously considered professionals because they received stipends for living expenses \u2014 to defect to the NCAA ranks.",
      "McKenna, living on his own for the first time nearly 3,500 miles from his home in Whitehorse in Canada\u2019s Yukon Territory, has already made a strong first impression on his coaches and teammates.",
      "Gadowsky said McKenna, is a \u201cchill, great hang\u201d while team captain Dane Dowiak called him a normal guy who \u201cjust wants to win.\u201d",
      "They\u2019ve all been mesmerized by the winger\u2019s hockey IQ, speed and ability to think and react before defenders can get a bead on him.",
      "\u201cHe does think the game differently,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cHe\u2019s a different animal when it comes to that. Not only compared to any other freshman, compared to anybody.\u201d",
      "But there are areas where the phenom will be tested, Gadowsky said.",

      "\u201cHe\u2019s going to be playing against guys eight years older that have been lifting weights in a very structured environment for a long time,\u201d Gadowsky said. \u201cDon\u2019t forget, he\u2019s 17 so there is going to be a transition process, there really is.\u201d",
      "McKenna is counting on it.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a lot less time and space,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cThe guys are bigger, faster, older. It\u2019s not too different in terms of skill and stuff. Obviously both leagues are very skilled and guys can make plays, but in terms of speed and size, I think that\u2019s the biggest difference.\u201d",
      "Listed at 6-foot, 170 pounds, McKenna said he considered the length of the NCAA season a positive and negative when making his decision.",
      "A negative because he loves the game and wants to play as much as possible. Even with a postseason run, Penn State played 40 games last year. McKenna skated in more than 60 games each of the last two seasons with Medicine Hat.",
      "The positive? He\u2019ll have some time to develop physically for what comes after his time in Happy Valley.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m itching to play games,\u201d McKenna said. \u201cWith that though, that\u2019s a reason I came here is because less games, more time in the gym. I\u2019m not a big guy, so I want to put on weight and that was part of the reason I came here.\u201d",
      "And to win.",
      "Aiden Fink, the team\u2019s leading scorer last season with 23 goals and 30 assists, is looking forward to skating with McKenna and is ready for the extra attention on the program.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be an exciting year for us, definitely,\u201d Fink said.",

      "Democratic senators are proposing a bill that would rewrite a 1961 law prohibiting college sports conferences from banding together to sell their media rights",
      "Democratic senators introduced a bill Monday that would rewrite a 1961 law prohibiting college sports conferences from banding together to sell their media rights. It's a move they say is designed to protect athletes, Olympics sports and smaller leagues that could be getting priced out of the increasingly expensive business of name, image and likeness deals.",
      "Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., joined with Sens. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., and Cory Booker, D-N.J., in backing the Student Athlete Fairness and Enforcement (SAFE) Act, a bill that gives lawmakers an alternative to a bill on the House side that has yet to come up for a floor vote.",
      "\u201cWe take a broader approach of: How do we solve the fundamental problem of implementing NIL rights, but also keeping revenue for women's and Olympic sports and an environment where everyone feels like they can compete?\u201d Cantwell said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cAnd we're maximizing for consumers and the public the amount of content available.\u201d",
      "Conferences currently sell their media rights separately, with the Big Ten, for instance, distributing around $958 million to its schools from the proceeds while the Big 12 number is at around $558 million \u2014 a 52.7% difference. All conferences are part of the $7.8 billion ESPN deal for the College Football Playoff, though the Big Ten and Southeastern Conference get more money from it.",
      "Cantwell has previously said she wants to prevent college sports from turning into a \u201cPower 2,\u201d featuring those leagues, with everyone else contending for scraps.",
      "Uunder terms of the landmark House antitrust settlement, schools as of July 1 are allowed to share up to 22% of their revenues \u2014 or around $20.5 million \u2014 from TV and other proceeds to pay players for their NIL during this school year.",
      "It has left some in the non-\u201cPower 2\u201d conferences wondering how they can draw top talent in football and basketball \u2014 the main revenue drivers \u2014 while maintaining smaller sports that form the pipeline for the teams America sends to the Olympics.",
      "The Democratic proposal, which would offer schools the same antitrust protection it does for the NFL and other pro leagues regarding their TV rights, is what billionaire Texas Tech regents chair Cody Campbell has proposed, going as far as running 30-second TV ads devoted to the topic on college football broadcasts.",
      "\u201cI think he thinks this is a way to even out the resources among all schools so that we can still have \u2018Any Given Saturday\u2019\u201d in college football, Cantwell said.",
      "Investors have floated ideas of super leagues, which would presumably involve pooling all the major-conference TV rights, estimating it could drive up to a $15 billion increase in revenue.",
      "Cantwell positions her bill as an alternative to the SCORE Act, which started with momentum but has recently stalled on the House side despite support from the NCAA.",

      "Cantwell's bill keeps the pre-emption idea but does not include the other two.",
      "\u201cThose closest to college sports ... have consistently called on Congress to take action to address the actual threats facing collegiate athletics,\" NCAA senior vice president Tim Buckley said. \u201cThis includes protecting student-athletes from being forced to become employees, and ensuring academic standards and other commonsense rules can be applied consistently.\u201d",
      "Cantwell's bill also offers strengthened protections for athletes from losing scholarships or health care. It would limit the number of times an athlete could transfer schools to two. It would give the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general authority to go after parties who violate rules written to oversee third-party collectives that now fund and oversee many of the NIL deals.",
      "The bill calls for football and basketball games to not be behind a paywall in local markets, a provision similar to how the NFL operates and that National Association of Broadcasters president Curtis LeGeyt said would strengthen \u201cthe unique connection between universities, their communities and the student-athletes who inspire them.\u201d",
      "The bill also calls on schools to use extra revenue generated from the new pooled media rights to maintain scholarships and roster spots for Olympic and women's sports at the same or greater levels than they were in 2023-24.",

      "\u201cMets fans everywhere.

      "\u201cWe are all feeling raw emotions today. I know how much time and effort you have put into this team. The result was unacceptable. Your emotions tell me how much you care and continues to motivate the organization to do better.\u201d",
      "President of Baseball Operations David Stearns immediately took the blame at a Citi Field news conference for a club he said \u201cunderachieved greatly,\u201d acknowledging New York's pitching and defense were especially problematic as the Mets went 38-55 over their last 93 games.",
      "The players acquired leading up to the July 31 trade deadline were mostly major flops in New York, namely Cedric Mullins, Ryan Helsley and Gregory Soto, and Stearns lamented \u201cwe didn\u2019t do a good enough job of fortifying our team when we had injuries midseason.\u201d",
      "\u201cTremendously disappointing season. Not nearly good enough. I think we all know that,\u201d he said at the outset of a question-and-answer session that lasted 31 minutes.",

      "The Minnesota Twins have fired manager Rocco Baldelli, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Twins fired manager Rocco Baldelli on Monday, ending his seven-year tenure that included three AL Central titles after a second straight disappointing season.",
      "Minnesota announced Baldelli's firing following a season marked by a major selloff leading up to the trade deadline after the team faltered in June and failed to mount any momentum in July. The Twins (70-92) went 19-35 after the deadline passed following the departure of 10 players off their major league roster, with only the Colorado Rockies faring worse over the final two months.",
      "The Twins finished with the fourth-worst record in the major leagues and their worst mark since 2016, when they went 59-103 after firing longtime general manager Terry Ryan at midseason. Current team president Derek Falvey was hired to replace Ryan after that.",
      "\"Over the past seven years Rocco has been much more than our manager. He has been a trusted partner and teammate to me in leading this organization,\u201d Falvey said in a statement. \u201cTogether we shared a deep care for the Twins, for our players and staff, and for doing everything in our power to put this club in the best position to succeed. Along the way we experienced some meaningful accomplishments, and I will always be proud of those, even as I wish we had ultimately achieved more.",
      "\u201cThis is a difficult day because of what Rocco represents to so many people here. He led with honesty, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to our players and staff. He gave himself fully to this role and I have tremendous respect and gratitude for the way he carried himself and the way he showed up every single day.\"",
      "For the second straight year, uncertainty around Baldelli\u2019s status hovered around the club. The Twins, who went 87-75 in 2023 to win their third AL Central title under Baldelli and their first series in the playoffs in 21 years, were in firm control of a wild-card spot down the stretch last season before tumbling out of contention with a 12-27 record over the last six weeks to land at 82-80.",
      "Factoring that finish into their extended funk this year, the Twins are 82-119 over their last 201 games for a .408 winning percentage. That includes a 13-game winning streak they produced earlier this season.",
      "Attendance has swooned at Target Field, with the Twins finishing with an 81-home game total of a little more than 1.7 million tickets sold, their lowest number in a non-pandemic season since 2000 when they played at the Metrodome and finished 69-93. Fans have mostly directed their disdain toward ownership, with deep frustration over cost-cutting that came after the 2023 breakthrough. The Pohlad family put the franchise up for sale last year, but decided last month to keep control and bring on two new investment groups for an infusion of cash to help pay down debt.",
      "The dizzying trade-deadline activity left Baldelli and his staff without much to work with down the stretch, though All-Star center fielder Byron Buxton was a bright spot in a breakthrough season for his health and rookie second baseman Luke Keaschall provided consistent production and a professional approach at the plate belying his inexperience.",

      "Baldelli was hired before the 2019 season to replace Hall of Famer Paul Molitor, with Falvey citing his adaptivity to the data-based direction of baseball strategy and his communication skill in distilling it to coaches and players and clearly setting expectations and preferences.",

      "Now, another change.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not ideal but unfortunately we talked about it a lot what the standards are for the Giants and we have high standards,\u201d Posey said. \u201cAnd I hold myself to those same standards. I understand fully the position that I\u2019m in now. My job and the team\u2019s success is evaluated accordingly as well. You without a doubt hope that there can be consistency in these leadership positions. We\u2019ve got to get back to a place where we\u2019re getting in the playoffs, we\u2019re making runs in playoffs. That\u2019s what our fan base deserves, that\u2019s what the city deserves.\u201d",
      "As Posey begins finalizing his list of candidates, one familiar name immediately came up as a possibility: Bochy. He has wrapped up his three-year contract with Texas but Posey noted, \u201cI don\u2019t know what his status is yet so I can\u2019t speak on that.\u201d",

      "Thomas Melchior shows up at soccer games wearing the jersey of the home team\u2019s fiercest rival \u2014 a move sure to rile the home fans \u2014 while holding a sign that says \u201clost a bet.\u201d",
      "He uses the attention to start a conversation about the dangers of sports betting, and posts video clips of the interactions on his social media accounts.",
      "The strategy can be risky \u2014 rival fans rarely mix at German soccer games and police go to great lengths to keep them apart to avoid trouble. Some of Melchior\u2019s clips show him getting confronted by aggressive fans who insult him, throw beer at him or demand that he take off his jersey.",
      "\u201cYes, it\u2019s dangerous, I wouldn\u2019t recommend it for anyone,\u201d Melchior told The Associated Press on Sunday, before he unveiled his hidden Hertha Berlin jersey at a home game of local rival Union Berlin.",
      "The sign says he lost a bet, but Melchior lost so much more. A former bank teller, he was sentenced to 5\u00bd years in prison in 2019 for fraud and theft offenses against strangers and people he knew after losing more than 800,000 euros ($937,000 today) on gambling. He lost his job, friends and family, too, and felt completely alone. He thought about ending his life.",
      "Now he's working on righting his wrongs, and repaying his debts.",
      "\u201cWhen the handcuffs clicked, it was the first moment I felt free again since my first bet. That\u2019s when I felt I had survived gambling addiction,\u201d Melchior said. \u201cIn that moment, I decided I would try to repair all the damage. And I wanted to get out of prison with the best possible conditions so I could inform and warn people about gambling addiction. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here today.\u201d",
      "Melchior, who has quickly built up a large following on TikTok and Instagram, received a mostly positive response from fans on Sunday \u2014 his message had already reached many through social media and some fans stopped for selfies \u2014 but there were others who expressed surprise or amusement.",
      "\u201cPoor sod!\u201d some fans laughed as they kept walking. Others stopped to talk and to hear Melchior\u2019s story and his advice to \u201ckeep your finger away from sports betting.\u201d Some covered his Hertha shirt with Union stickers.",
      "Coincidentally, last week the German soccer players\u2019 union (VDV) called on the German soccer federation (DFB) to stop accepting sponsorship funds from sports betting providers and to do more to prevent gambling addiction.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the DFB proclaims \u2018supporting effective addiction prevention\u2019 as one of its goals in its statutes, while it simultaneously sells exorbitant amounts of advertising space to sports betting providers,\u201d VDV vice president Maik Franz, a former Bundesliga player, said in a statement.",

      "He said the emergence of the 18-year-old Yamal places doubts over whether Mbappe would become a multiple Ballon d'Or winner.",
      "\u201cNow it could be very complicated because of the fascination of this young player of 18 years that broke all the records for (someone his) age,\u201d said Caioli. \u201cAlso the age starts to be interesting for Mbappe. He's not 19 years old like when he won the World Cup. It\u2019s changed.\u201d",
      "Yamal, who has already led Spain to a European Championship and Barcelona to the Spanish title in his nascent career, won the Kopa trophy for the best under-21 player for the second year running. But there were claims he deserved the top prize, which would have made him the youngest ever recipient of the Ballon d'Or - overtaking Brazil striker Ronaldo, who won it aged 21.",
      "La Liga president Javier Tebas said the forward was only overlooked because of his age. Yamal\u2019s father said his son was the \u201cbest player in the world by far.\u201d",
      "There was no such outrage in response to Mbappe missing out. Not even from his club, Real Madrid, which last year boycotted the ceremony when Vinicius Junior was beaten to the prize by Manchester City midfielder Rodri.",
      "Frankly, Mbappe was barely part of the conversation this year despite winning the Golden Shoe as the top scorer in Europe.",
      "But at the age of 26, Mbappe's levels are not dropping. The Golden Shoe was the first of his career and last month he moved past Thierry Henry's total of 51 goals for France. He is now just six short of overtaking Olivier Giroud as his country's all-time leading scorer.",
      "He was the first teenager since Brazil great Pele to score in a World Cup final when France won in 2018. And he followed that four years later by becoming only the second player to score a hat trick in the final when France lost on penalties against Argentina.",
      "He left Paris Saint-Germain as the club's all-time top scorer.",
      "Yet despite the comments by Tebas and Yamal\u2019s father, few could say Dembele was not a deserved winner of the Ballon d'Or as the star player of a PSG team that won the Champions League and the French league and Cup, scoring 32 goals.",

The criteria includes individual and team performances, \u201cdecisive and impressive character\u201d and \u201cclass and fair play.\u201d",

      "Which is why Mbappe could consider himself unfortunate to miss out after winning the World Cup with France in 2018 when he placed fourth. The winner that year was Luka Modric, who was runner up in the World Cup with Croatia and won the Champions League with Madrid.",
      "\u201cI did everything I could, but not everything I could to win a Ballon d\u2019Or,\u201d Mbappe said at the time. \u201cIt shows me how much I still have to do to win this trophy or it would be too easy to get there and win it all at once.\u201d",
      "Mbappe's highest placing in the Ballon d'Or came in 2023 after his World Cup final hat trick. The winner that year was Messi, who led Argentina to victory at the Qatar tournament.",
      "The expectation that Mbappe could dominate the Ballon d'Or was based on the standards set by Messi and Ronaldo, who won it a combined 13 times. It was predicted that he and Man City striker Erling Haaland would develop a similar rivalry, but Yamal's emergence has changed that.",

      "The ceremony was first delayed for unclear reasons for over one-and-a-half hours. The Pakistan team, led by captain Salman Agha, then arrived late for the ceremony. However, there was a further delay as the Indian team refused to accept the trophy from Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief Mohsin Naqvi, who is also the chief of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the Interior Minister of Pakistan.",
      "India\u2019s Twenty20 skipper Suryakumar Yadav claimed that his team was denied the chance to lift the 2025 Asia Cup trophy.",

And I can\u2019t say anything more.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff \u2013 those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.\u201d",
      "A statement on the ACC website had stated on Saturday that Naqvi would hand over the trophy to the Asia Cup winners. However, it is understood that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from him \u2013 in line with their refusal to shake hands with the Pakistan team in any of the three matches the two sides played during the tournament, both at the coin toss and at the end of the match.",
      "While the Indian team had refused to accept the trophy from Naqvi, he reportedly refused to step down from the presentation ceremony altogether. Before the ceremony began, an official also removed the Asia Cup trophy from the presentation podium. No explanation was provided from the ACC for this action.",
      "\u201cLadies and gentlemen, I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that does conclude the post-match presentation,\u201d Simon Doull, former New Zealand cricketer and broadcaster, announced.",

So it is very unfortunate and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.",

      "Over his five matches at Bethpage Black, McIlroy endured a torrent of insults about everything from his personal life to past failures on the golf course. People shouted out as he lined up to swing and putt. His wife was hit by a cup of beer.",
      "\u201cWhat happened here this week is not acceptable,\u201d McIlroy said on Sunday after going 3-1-1 to help Europe beat the United States 15-13. His lone loss came in a Sunday singles match with world No. 1 Scottie Scheffler, who had also played in all five sessions, that was more of a slog than a pristine, shot-for-shot battle of the world\u2019s top two players.",
      "It was McIlroy\u2019s most blunt assessment yet of a New York crowd that Europe fully expected to be rowdy and passionate \u2014 captain Luke Donald even gave players virtual-reality goggles to get used to the noise \u2014 but maybe not this crass or downright obnoxious.",
      "The 36-year-old Northern Irishman, who came to Bethpage on a mission to win his second Ryder Cup on U.S. soil, sometimes pushed back \u2014 whirling around and cursing at his hecklers or stepping away from a shot until the riled masses settled down.",
      "On Saturday, he told boisterous fans to \u201cshut the (expletive) up\u201d before knocking his approach to 3 feet to set up a clinching putt in a morning foursomes match. When a fan yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re not that good, Rory!\u201d he responded: \u201cI\u2019m (expletive) very good.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am,\u201d McIlroy added at the winners' press conference. \u201cReally good.\u201d",
      "While there was more golf to play, McIlroy stayed guarded in his post-match interviews. Asked on Saturday if he thought fans had crossed a line, he said: \u201cPeople can be their own judge of whether they took it too far or not.\u201d After all, he still had to deal with them on Sunday.",
      "With the crowds gone and the Ryder Cup in hand, the five-time major champion let loose.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we should ever accept that in golf,\u201d McIlroy told reporters, his European teammates and captain crowded around on the interview room dais. \u201cI think golf should be held to a higher standard than what was seen out there this week.\u201d",
      "Then he turned philosophical about the sport that has made him rich and popular, that he has worked at since he was a boy, that he has achieved so much in, including the career Grand Slam.",
      "\u201cGolf has the ability to unite people. Golf teaches you very good life lessons. It teaches you etiquette. It teaches you how to play by the rules. It teaches you how to respect people,\" McIlroy said. \u201cSometimes this week we didn\u2019t see that. So no, this should not be what is acceptable in the Ryder Cup.\u201d",
      "The culprits, he noted, were the minority of a crowd full of \u201ctrue golf fans\u201d who were \u201crespectful and let both teams have the same chance to hit the shots and play a fair contest.\u201d",

As European fans serenaded him with their go-to cheer, a version of a song by the Cranberries that replaces \u201cZombie\u201d with \u201cRory,\u201d American fans did everything they could to knock him off his game.",
      "They reminded him of his missed putt to lose the U.S. Open at Pinehurst in 2024. They made fun of his height. They mocked his Irish heritage. They went after his wife.",
      "\u201cI was out there for two days with Erica McIlroy, and the amount of abuse that she received was astonishing,\" McIlroy\u2019s friend and teammate Shane Lowry said. \u201cThe way she was out there supporting her husband and supporting her team was unbelievable, and kudos to her for that.\u201d",
      "Lowry assumed the role of bodyguard and bouncer as tensions rose during his and McIlroy\u2019s fourball match on Saturday. The Irishman told off fans and jawed with hecklers, thumping his chest, marching across the green and cursing at the crowd after sinking a pivotal putt.",
      "By Sunday, a European victory was all but assured. The visitors were up 11 1/2 to 4 1/2 going into the final round. No side had ever come back from such a deficit \u2014 and still hasn't.",
      "As the U.S. mounted a charge, aided by Scheffler\u2019s win over McIlroy, there were chants of \u201cUSA!\u201d and a few insults flung McIlroy\u2019s way, but fans behaved, for the most part. More than a dozen state troopers flanked their group and a marshal warned spectators to \u201ckeep it clean.\"",
      "In the end, it was McIlroy who had the final word. In April, he won the Masters after years of trying to complete the career grand slam. Now, he's won his sixth Ryder Cup in eight tries, improving his record in the event to 19-14-5. And the next one is a veritable home game, at Adare Manor in Ireland.",
      "\u201cWe will be making sure to say to our fans in Ireland in 2027 that what happened here this week is not acceptable,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd for me, it\u2019s, you know, come and support your home team.",
      "\u201cI think if I was an American, I would be annoyed that people \u2014 I didn\u2019t hear a lot of shouts for Scottie today, but I heard a lot of shouts against me. It\u2019s like, support your players. That\u2019s the thing.\u201d",

      "Alphabet, the parent of Google, is the third major technology company to settle a volley of lawsuits that Trump brought for what he alleged had unfairly muzzled him after his first term as president ended in January 2021.

      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed into law legislation aiming to increase transparency and prevent AI models from being used to cause catastrophic harms",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Monday signed a law that aims to prevent people from using powerful artificial intelligence models for potentially catastrophic activities like building a bioweapon or shutting down a bank system.",
      "The move comes as Newsom touted California as a leader in AI regulation and criticized the inaction at the federal level in a recent conversation with former President Bill Clinton. The new law will establish some of the first-in-the-nation regulations on large-scale AI models without hurting the state's homegrown industry, Newsom said. Many of the world's top AI companies are located in California and will have to follow the requirements.",
      "\u201cCalifornia has proven that we can establish regulations to protect our communities while also ensuring that the growing AI industry continues to thrive. This legislation strikes that balance,\" Newsom said in a statement.",
      "The legislation requires AI companies to implement and disclose publicly safety protocols to prevent their most advanced models from being used to cause major harm. The rules are designed to cover AI systems if they meet a \u201cfrontier\u201d threshold that signals they run on a huge amount of computing power.",
      "Such thresholds are based on how many calculations the computers are performing. Those who crafted the regulations have acknowledged the numerical thresholds are an imperfect starting point to distinguish today\u2019s highest-performing generative AI systems from the next generation that could be even more powerful. The existing systems are largely made by California-based companies like Anthropic, Google, Meta Platforms and OpenAI.",
      "The legislation defines a catastrophic risk as something that would cause at least $1 billion in damage or more than 50 injuries or deaths. It's designed to guard against AI being used for activities that could cause mass disruption, such as hacking into a power grid.",
      "Companies also have to report to the state any critical safety incidents within 15 days. The law creates whistleblower protections for AI workers and establishes a public cloud for researchers. It includes a fine of $1 million per violation.",
      "It drew opposition from some tech companies, which argued that AI legislation should be done at the federal level. But Anthropic said the regulations are \u201cpractical safeguards\u201d that make official the safety practices many companies are already doing voluntarily.",
      "\"While federal standards remain essential to avoid a patchwork of state regulations, California has created a strong framework that balances public safety with continued innovation,\u201d Jack Clark, co-founder and head of policy at Anthropic, said in a statement.",
      "The signing comes after Newsom last year vetoed a broader version of the legislation, siding with tech companies that said the requirements were too rigid and would have hampered innovation. Newsom instead asked a group of several industry experts, including AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, to develop recommendations on guardrails around powerful AI models.",
      "The new law incorporates recommendations and feedback from Newsom\u2019s group of AI experts and the industry, supporters said. The legislation also doesn't put the same level of reporting requirements on startups to avoid hurting innovation, said state Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco, the bill's author.",

      "The parental controls will be available to all users, but both parents and teens will need their own accounts to take advantage of them.",
      "To get started, a parent or guardian needs to send an email or text message to invite a teen to connect their accounts. Or a teenager can send an invite to a parent. Users can send a request by going into the settings menu and then to the \"Parental controls\" section.",
      "Teens can unlink their accounts at any time, but parents will be notified if they do.",
      "Once the accounts are linked, the teen account will get some built-in protections, OpenAI said.",
      "Teen accounts will \u201cautomatically get additional content protections, including reduced graphic content, viral challenges, sexual, romantic or violent role-play, and extreme beauty ideals, to help keep their experience age-appropriate,\u201d the company said.",
      "Parents can choose to turn these filters off, but teen users don't have the option.",
      "OpenAI warns that such guardrails are \u201cnot foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\u201d It advised parents to talk with their children about \u201chealthy AI use.\u201d",

Here he is as a Star Wars Jedi wielding a patriot-red lightsaber, rescuing our galaxy from the forces of evil. Here he is taking over Gaza, transforming the strip into a luxury resort complete with a golden effigy of himself.",
      "You can be anything, perhaps you were told growing up. Doctor. Astronaut. Maybe, one day, the president. But even the chief executive of the United States, the free world\u2019s leader, frames himself as something more epic \u2014 as someone not entirely himself.",
      "On the social media accounts of Donald Trump and his second-term administration, a new official image of the president is emerging bit by bit: one generated artificially.",
      "A sign of the times, certainly \u2014 when the appeal of reimagining yourself with artificial intelligence has trickled up from us everyday citizens. Bored with your selfies? Join a viral trend: There\u2019s an image generator or a chatbot that can turn you into a Renaissance-style painting, a Studio Ghibli character or an action figure with box art and accessories.",
      "Artificial imagery isn\u2019t new for Trump, an early target of AI-generated simulacra who later exploited the technology during his 2024 campaign for the presidency. \u201cIt works both ways,\u201d the Republican president said of AI-generated content at a news conference earlier this month. \u201cIf something happens that\u2019s really bad, maybe I\u2019ll have to just blame AI.\u201d",
      "The AI images of Trump posted by him and his team opt for the alternative \u2014 not deceptive but self-evident in their fictitiousness. Pope Francis dies, and Trump jokes to reporters that he\u2019d like to be pope. A week later, he is, but in an AI-generated image that he posts, reposted by the White House. Trump likens himself to a king in a Truth Social post in February, and AI makes him one in an X post by the White House less than an hour later.",
      "The artifice arrives in Trump\u2019s usual style \u2014 brassy, unabashed, attention-grabbing \u2014 and squares with his social media team\u2019s heavy meme posting, which it has promised to continue. The administration\u2019s official social media accounts have grown by more than 16 million new followers across platforms since Inauguration Day, a White House official told NBC News.",
      "The White House recognizes the appeal. In July, it posted to its X account: \u201cNowhere in the Constitution does it say we can\u2019t post banger memes.\u201d Attached to the post, a photo of a sign on the White House lawn parodying the naysayers: \u201coMg, diD tHe wHiTE hOuSE reALLy PosT tHis?\u201d",

      "Like so much on the internet these days, Trump\u2019s AI portraits are primed for people to react, says Evan Cornog, a political historian and author of \u201cThe Power and the Story: How the Crafted Presidential Narrative Has Determined Political Success from George Washington to George W. Bush.\u201d",
      "\u201cBy the time you\u2019ve seen it, you\u2019ve understood it. And that\u2019s, of course, the efficacy,\u201d Cornog said. \u201cIt requires no effort, either for the person generating it, but particularly for the person consuming it.\u201d",
      "The expressive power of political imagery, regardless of the truth of its message, has long been understood by politicians and their detractors.",
      "President William Henry Harrison\u2019s log cabin and hard cider campaign symbols, representing him as a \u201cman of the people,\u201d helped him win the election of 1840. Thirty years later, political cartoonist Thomas Nast would turn public opinion against William Marcy \u201cBoss\u201d Tweed with his scathing portrayals of the politician, whom he depicted satirically overweight from greed. \u201cLet\u2019s stop those damned pictures!\u201d Tweed once said, or so the story goes.",
      "The decades since witnessed the birth of photo, film, TV, the internet, computer printers, image-editing software and digital screens that shrank until they could fit in our pockets, making it increasingly easy to create and disseminate \u2014 and manipulate \u2014 imagery.",
      "By contrast, today\u2019s generative AI technology offers greater realism, functionality and accessibility to content creation than ever before, says AI expert Henry Ajder. Not to mention, of course, a capacity for endless automated possibility.",

      "Earlier this month, the Federal Trade Commission announced it was opening inquiries into seven AI chatbot companies \u2014 including the parent companies of Instagram and Facebook, Google, ChatGPT, Grok (the chatbot on X), Character.AI and Snapchat \u2014 on how they \"measure, test and monitor potentially negative impacts of this technology on children and teens.\u201d And the Food and Drug Administration is convening an advisory committee Nov. 6 to review generative AI-enabled mental health devices.",
      "Federal agencies could consider restrictions on how chatbots are marketed, limit addictive practices, require disclosures to users that they are not medical providers, require companies to track and report suicidal thoughts, and offer legal protections for people who report bad practices by companies, Wright said.",
      "From \"companion apps\u201d to \u201cAI therapists\u201d to \u201cmental wellness\u201d apps, AI\u2019s use in mental health care is varied and hard to define, let alone write laws around.",
      "That has led to different regulatory approaches. Some states, for example, take aim at companion apps that are designed just for friendship, but don't wade into mental health care. The laws in Illinois and Nevada ban products that claim to provide mental health treatment outright, threatening fines up to $10,000 in Illinois and $15,000 in Nevada.",
      "But even a single app can be tough to categorize.",
      "Earkick's Stephan said there is still a lot that is \u201cvery muddy\u201d about Illinois' law, for example, and the company has not limited access there.",
      "Stephan and her team initially held off calling their chatbot, which looks like a cartoon panda, a therapist. But when users began using the word in reviews, they embraced the terminology so the app would show up in searches.",
      "Last week, they backed off using therapy and medical terms again. Earkick\u2019s website described its chatbot as \u201cYour empathetic AI counselor, equipped to support your mental health journey,\u201d but now it\u2019s a \u201cchatbot for self care.\u201d",

      "The app is still in testing and not widely available. But Jacobson worries about what strict bans will mean for developers taking a careful approach. He noted Illinois had no clear pathway to provide evidence that an app is safe and effective.",
      "\u201cThey want to protect folks, but the traditional system right now is really failing folks,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, trying to stick with the status quo is really not the thing to do.\u201d",

      "K\u0101rearea, the Indigenous M\u0101ori name for the New Zealand falcon, was crowned Bird of the Year on Monday. But the annual poll, run by conservation group Forest & Bird, is no ordinary online vote.",

      "\u201cBird of the Year has grown from a simple email poll in 2005 to a hotly contested cultural moment,\u201d said Forest & Bird Chief Executive Nicola Toki. \u201cBehind the memes and mayhem is a serious message.\u201d",
      "The contest draws attention to New Zealand\u2019s native bird species, with 80% designated as being in trouble to some degree. But it attracts passionate fandom because New Zealanders are bird-obsessed.",
      "In a country with no native land mammals except for two species of bat, birds reign supreme. They appear in art, on jewelry, in schoolchildren\u2019s songs, and in the name New Zealanders are known by abroad, \u201ckiwis.\u201d",
      "Beloved birds include alpine parrots that harass tourists and pigeons which get so drunk on berries that they sometimes fall out of trees.",
      "\u201cThis is not a land of lions, tigers and bears,\u201d said Toki. \u201cThe birds here are weird and wonderful and not what you would expect to see perhaps in other countries.\u201d",

      "It was the highest-ever voter turnout apart from an episode when Last Week Tonight host John Oliver volunteered as a campaign manager in 2023, prompting mostly joking accusations from New Zealanders of American interference. Perhaps inevitably, Oliver\u2019s bird, the p\u016bteketeke or Australasian crested grebe, won in a 290,000-vote landslide.",
      "Other controversies have struck the poll. In 2021, there was mild uproar when a bat won the title, despite not being a bird.",
      "The vote was ruffled by a foreign influence scandal in 2018 when self-styled comedians in Australia cast hundreds of fraudulent votes for a bird that shares its name with an Antipodean slang term for sex. Voters must now verify the email addresses used to cast their votes.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",
      "Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.",

      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",
      "The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don\u2019t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

      "HOLLY RIDGE, La. -- In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.",
      "While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.",

      "Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts \u2014 equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta\u2019s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.",
      "Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.",

      "Davante Lewis \u2014 the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan \u2014 said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s certain information we should know and need to know but don\u2019t have,\u201d Lewis said.",
      "Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to \u201ctens of millions of dollars or more each year\u201d in lost revenue.",
      "Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.",
      "Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be \u201cvery little\u201d impact on ratepayers.",
      "But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta\u2019s facility.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana's Republican governor asked for National Guard deployments to New Orleans and other cities, saying Monday that his state needs help fighting crime and praising President Donald Trump's decision to send troops to Washington and Memphis.",
      "Gov. Jeff Landry, a Trump ally, asked for up to 1,000 troops through fiscal year 2026 in a letter sent to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. It comes weeks after Trump suggested New Orleans could be one of his next targets for deploying the National Guard to fight crime.",
      "Trump also sent troops in recent months to Los Angeles and his administration has announced plans for similar actions in other major cities, including Chicago and Portland, Oregon.",
      "Landry said his request \u201cbuilds on the proven success\u201d of deployments to Washington and Memphis. While Trump has ordered troops into Memphis with the backing of Tennessee's Republican governor, as of Monday night there had yet to be a large-scale operation in the city.",
      "\u201cFederal partnerships in our toughest cities have worked, and now, with the support of President Trump and Secretary Hegseth, we are taking the next step by bringing in the National Guard,\u201d Landry said.",
      "Leaders in Democratic-controlled states have criticized the planned deployments. In Oregon, elected officials have said troops in Portland are not needed.",
      "In his request, Landry said there has been \u201celevated violent crime rates\u201d in Shreveport, Baton Rouge and New Orleans as well as shortages in local law enforcement. He said the state\u2019s vulnerability to natural disasters made the issue more challenging and that extra support would be especially helpful for major events, including Mardi Gras and college football bowl games.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth plan to address hundreds of U.S. military officials in person Tuesday after the Pentagon suddenly asked top commanders from around the world to convene at a base in Virginia without publicly revealing the reason.",
      "The gathering at the Marine Corps base in Quantico near Washington has fueled intense speculation about the purpose and value of summoning such a large number of generals and admirals to one place, with many stationed in more than a dozen countries that include conflict zones in the Middle East and elsewhere.",
      "Meetings between top military brass and civilian leaders are nothing new. But experts say the scale of the gathering, the haste with which it was called and the mystery surrounding it are particularly unusual.",
      "\u201cThe notion that the secretary is going to talk to the generals and give them his vision for running the department \u2014 and maybe also for strategy and organization \u2014 that\u2019s perfectly reasonable,\u201d said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies and a retired Marine colonel.",
      "\u201cWhat's mystifying is why it's on such short notice, why it's in person and what else might be involved,\u201d he said.",
      "The uncertainty comes as the country faces a potential government shutdown this week and as Hegseth, who has hammered home a focus on lethality and what he calls the \u201cwarrior ethos,\" has taken several unusual and unexplained actions, including ordering cuts to the number of general officers and firings of other top military leaders.",
      "News about the abruptly scheduled meeting broke Thursday, and top Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell confirmed it but declined to release further details.",
      "Trump didn\u2019t seem to know about it when he was asked by reporters during an Oval Office appearance later that day. The president said he'll \"be there if they want me, but why is that such a big deal?\u201d",
      "A White House official said Sunday that Trump also will speak at the gathering. The president told NBC News that he and Hegseth would be \u201ctalking about how well we\u2019re doing militarily, talking about being in great shape, talking about a lot of good, positive things.\u201d",
      "Vice President JD Vance argued last week that the media had turned it into a \u201cbig story\u201d and that it was \u201cnot particularly unusual that generals who report to\u201d Hegseth are coming to speak with him.",
      "Italian Adm. Giuseppe Cavo Dragone, the chair of NATO\u2019s Military Committee, described the meeting as unusual and told reporters Saturday after a NATO meeting in Riga, Latvia, that \u201cas far as my 49 years of service, I\u2019ve never seen that before.\u201d",

      "\u201cJust the sheer scale makes you wonder what kind of meaningful interaction can occur,\u201d said O'Hanlon, Brookings' director of research for foreign policy. \u201cAnd therefore it smacks more of theatrics or of trying to impose than of trying to exchange views.\"",
      "Bryan Clark, a senior fellow and director of the Center for Defense Concepts and Technology at the Hudson Institute, said he expects the meeting to center on the Trump administration\u2019s shift in defense policy. The U.S. military is expected to focus less on Europe and Asia and more on the Northern Hemisphere, a change that breaks with decades of precedent, he said.",
      "Hegseth has championed the military's role in securing the U.S.-Mexico border, deploying to American cities as part of Trump's law enforcement surges, and carrying out strikes on boats in the Caribbean that the administration says targeted drug traffickers.",
      "\u201cI think they\u2019re trying to set the tone, set the context, for these generals and admirals to say the strategy we have coming out is very different than what you\u2019re used to \u2014 we need you to all be on board with it,\" Clark said.",
      "Video teleconferencing across the world is difficult because leaders are spread across time zones, Clark said. Forcing them to attend the meeting in person will drill the point home.",

It would be Florida's 13th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year, followed by Texas with five. Two more executions are planned next month in Florida.",
      "Jones was convicted and sentenced to death in 1993 on two counts of first-degree murder. Jurors also found him guilty of two counts of armed robbery.",
      "Jones was a new employee at a Miami-Dade business owned by Matilda and Jacob Nestor in December 1990 when he stabbed the wife in the neck and the husband in the chest. Investigators determined that before he died from his wounds, Jacob Nestor managed to retreat to an office. He pulled a .22 caliber pistol from a holster and fired five times, striking Jones once in the forehead.",
      "Police found Jones wounded at the scene with the Nestors\u2019 money and personal property in his pockets. Jones was subsequently hospitalized.",
      "Jones filed an appeal with the Florida Supreme Court earlier this month, based on intellectual disability and alleged abuse he suffered as a teen at a since shuttered state-run reform school. Justices denied the claims, finding that the disability issue had already been litigated and allegations of abuse were never presented during Jones' trial.",

    "story": [
      "Chinese Premier Li Qiang has made a strong case for China's role in global governance at the United Nations General Assembly",
      "WASHINGTON -- Hardly a month after Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed his \u201cGlobal Governance Initiative,\u201d Beijing made its intent clear at the most global of forums \u2014 that it should, and is qualified to, help shape the world order even as the United States tips more inward under Donald Trump.",
      "In a seemingly jargon-filled speech delivered to the U.N. General Assembly on Friday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang told the audience that \u201ca China that bears in mind the greater good of humanity and stands ready to take up responsibilities will bring more positive energy into the world.\" His words seized on the retreat by the American president from international organizations and on his apparent disdain towards the United Nations.",
      "Li never once mentioned the United States by name. But in not-so-subtle swipes at recent actions by the United States, he touted his country's credentials: lowering tariffs to promote global economy, vowing to cut greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change and committing to safeguarding the authority of the United Nations.",
      "It represents a shift in approach to global affairs that experts say reflects a China that sees itself on the ascent.",
      "\u201cLi\u2019s speech confirms that China\u2019s foreign policy posture today is firmly anchored in the ambition of turning a Western-dominant world order into one that is much more conducive to Chinese interests, values, and leadership,\u201d said Olivia Cheung, lecturer in politics at King's College London. \u201cChina\u2019s foreign policy today is notably more confident, strategic, and coherent than how it was in 2017, where Beijing\u2019s presentation of global governance reform lacked content.\"",
      "The speech has come amid growing worries in Washington that China, the world's second-largest economy, might seek to unseat the United States as the global leader, even though Beijing has repeatedly assured Washington that it has no intention to challenge or replace the U.S. Instead, Xi has said Beijing should enjoy a global say befitting of its economic might and global stature.",
      "Li opened his speech by evoking the history of the United Nations and crediting it for the by-and-large peace and prosperity in the ensuing eight decades. Then, he lamented on the \u201cchaos\u201d the world is faced with today.",
      "\u201cThe world has entered a new period of turbulence and transformation,\u201d Li said, leveling his criticisms at \u201cunilateralism and Cold War mentality\" and repeated disruptions to the international system.",
      "\u201cHow could we, when confronted with unscrupulous acts of hegemonism and bullying, remain silent and submissive for fear of might?\u201d the Chinese premier asked. The terms \u201cunilateralism,\u201d \u201cCold War mentality,\u201d \u201chegemonism\u201d and \u201cbullying\u201d are usually associated with the U.S. in Beijing's diplomatic talks.",
      "Then, the Chinese premier portrayed China as a desirable answer to such problems \u2014 a founding member of the United Nations that has in recent years shared \u201cChina\u2019s wisdom and solution for navigating global transformations and overcoming pressing challenges.\u201d",
      "The Global Governance Initiative, as proposed by Xi in early September, \u201cpoints the right direction and provides an important pathway for building a more just and equitable global governance system,\u201d Li said.",
      "The reframing is, on some levels, fundamental.",
      "In a podcast aired Sept. 26, Cheung told the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations that Beijing's strategic thinking has shifted under Xi \u2014 from maintaining good ties with the U.S. and other Western nations for China's economic growth to \u201creshaping the international system so that the rest of the world respect and accept China\u2019s interest in the way that Beijing defines it.\"",

      "What Beijing is most interested in, Cheung said, is \u201cchanging global governance in a way that puts the United Nations front and center\u201d where China can have \u201ca lot more involvement and influences and leverage in how it functions.\u201d",
      "Li's speech Friday conveys the impression that Xi's proposition of \u201cforging the common destiny for humankind\u2019 is not only an aspiration but \u201dpolicy actions that are noble and urgent, with which China uniquely has strong technical competencies to lead,\" Cheung told the Associated Press.",
      "As the Trump administration imposes steep tariffs, threatens territorial annexations and goes after multilateral institutions, \u201cChina seeks to present itself as a key upholder of a postwar order in whose viability the United States seems to be losing confidence\u201d, said Ali Wyne, a senior research and advocacy advisory for U.S.-China relations at the International Crisis Group.",
      "But China does not appear to have either the capacity or the desire to offer a wholesale alternative, Wyne said. Instead, he said, China appears interested in deepening its influences in certain areas and attempting to legitimize its longstanding contention that new norms are needed to reflect emerging geopolitical trends.",
      "The gulf between Beijing's words and its actions is another question. Where the Chinese government is concerned, its action often fails to align with its word, said Craig Singleton, senior director of the China Program at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies.",
      "\u201cPremier Li\u2019s remarks leaned heavily on multilateral language, but Beijing\u2019s track record tells a different story,\" Singleton said. \u201cChina champions sovereignty at the U.N. while systematically eroding it in practice, from Hong Kong to the South China Sea.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cLi\u2019s calls for \u2018cooperation\u2019 and \u2018openness\u2019 sound constructive, but they\u2019re designed to blunt pressure on China\u2019s economy and technology sector.\"",
      "A day earlier, Li held a meeting with American businesspeople and scholars in New York. He assured the group that China would \u201ccontinuously expand market access and increase imports\u201d and provide foreign businesses with \u201cthe certainty they need to operate and develop in China,\u201d according to a Chinese government statement.",
      "The two countries are locked in a trade dispute, and Xi and Trump are scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping of 21 economies, to be held at the end of October in South Korea, to help recalibrate bilateral relations.",
      "The Chinese premier said the two countries \u201ccould and should\u201d become partners and friends, and he repeated a line from Xi: \u201cThe Pacific Ocean is vast enough to accommodate both China and the United States, as well as other countries.\"",

      "\u201cHis legacy is one of courage, resilience, tremendous skill and dogged perseverance against racism, prejudice and other evils,\u201d Tuskegee Airmen Inc. said in a Facebook post.",
      "Born in Philadelphia, Hardy was a dedicated student who dreamed of becoming an engineer and never planned on joining the military. He was intrigued after his brother joined the U.S. Navy, but still pursued a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering and a master\u2019s degree in systems engineering from the U.S. Air Force Institute, according to the National WWII museum.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until 1941 when the Army started opening the door for us to be pilots and whatnot. And we walked through the door and had a great opportunity, and we took advantage of it,\u201d Hardy told AVI-8, an \u201caviation-inspired\u201d watch manufacturer, in an interview.",
      "Prior to World War II, Black Americans were not allowed to serve in the Air Force. But in 1941, the Tuskegee Airmen unit was established by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the 99th Pursuit Squadron based at the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. The military pilots served in a segregated World War II unit and their all-Black 332nd Fighter Group had one of the lowest loss records of all the bomber escorts in the war.",
      "Several white leaders in the U.S. Army Air Forces tried to prevent Black pilots from combat duty and banned them from using their club spaces, spurring civil disobedience from Tuskegee Airmen.",
      "Hardy was commissioned as a second lieutenant at 19 and flew his first combat mission before he had ever driven a car, he told AVI. He ultimately completed 21 World War II missions and also served in the Korean War and Vietnam War.",
      "Brian Smith, president and CEO of the Tuskegee Airmen National Historical Museum, described Hardy as a \u201chumble man\u201d with a passion for aviation. He was passionate about encouraging young people to become pilots and up until recent years he often attended air shows, Smith said.",

      "The Marine Corps is now touting that it hit its recruiting goals this year",
      "QUANTICO, Va. -- The Army, Navy and Air Force, with encouragement from the Trump administration, all announced this summer that they had met their recruiting goals months ahead of schedule.",
      "That is a major shift from the past several years when the military has failed to meet its recruiting goals because of complications from the COVID-19 pandemic, tight job markets and a growing generation of young Americans struggling to meet fitness and academic standards. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth claimed the turnaround as an early victory, arguing that recruits had been put off by what he called a weakened military under Democratic President Joe Biden.",
      "However, the uptick began well before President Donald Trump won office again in November, and a major driver has been programs the services started years ago to boost numbers.",
      "While the Marine Corps didn't wade into the fray earlier, it is now claiming success. And the general in charge of the effort says the politics of the moment have had no impact on Marine recruiting.",
      "\u201cThe Marines are probably the most inelastic of the services,\u201d Lt. Gen. William Bowers told The Associated Press this month. \u201cWe appeal to a certain type of young man or woman \u2014 that really doesn\u2019t change with the economic winds.\"",
      "\"They want to be part of that mystique,\u201d he added.",
      "Data provided by the Corps shows that it has recruited 30,536 active duty and reserve enlisted Marines \u2014 just one person over its annual goal. It also recruited 1,792 active duty and reserve officers, beating its goal by two people.",
      "Officials say the figures are not the result of a struggle to meet the numbers but a reflection of how careful the Corps has to be in not overrecruiting.",
      "Bowers said that when he took the job as deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, he moved the date for 500 recruits to head to boot camp until after September to avoid the Marines growing past their congressionally authorized size.",
      "Formal recruiting figures for all the military services are typically announced after the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.",
      "The Marines also beat enlisted recruiting goals by a single person last year. The service made its enlisted recruiting goal by 351 Marines in 2023, when the Army, Navy and Air Force all missed their targets by thousands of recruits. The Army alone came up about 10,000 short.",
      "However, the Corps in 2022 also had to dip into its pools of delayed-entry applicants \u2014 the same pool Bowers is now bolstering \u2014 to make its goals.",
      "The Marines have not altered their entry requirements and are \u201cunapologetic\u201d about their standards.",
      "\u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been in the country, the American people know the Marine Corps has very high standards and that we stick to them,\u201d Bowers said. He added, \u201cIf you try to appeal to everybody, you won\u2019t get the people you maybe really want.\u201d",
      "But there is also an inherent contrast with the other military services.",

      "Army and Navy officials said none of those programs is a lowering of standards.",
      "The Corps doesn\u2019t offer the lavish cash bonuses that some services do to attract recruits. The U.S. military overall spent more than $2 billion over the past three years to recruit service members, with the Corps accounting for just over 2.5%, or about $51 million, of that.",

      "Colombia's foreign minister has renounced her U.S. visa to protest the U.S. State Department's decision to revoke Colombian President Gustavo Petro's visa",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia's foreign minister has \u201crenounced\u201d her U.S. visa to protest a decision by the U.S. State Department to revoke the visa of Colombian President Gustavo Petro, the Colombian government said Monday.",
      "The decision by Foreign Minister Rosa Villavicencio comes as tensions between both nations escalate over issues that include drug policy, the war in Gaza and a U.S. naval buildup in neighboring Venezuela.",
      "Colombia's Foreign Affairs Ministry did not respond to questions about what kind of visa Villavicencio held, but said in a statement that it was not interested in \u201cdiplomatic visas that limit opinions\" or curtail the nation's \"sovereignty.\u201d",
      "Later on Monday, Colombian Finance Minister Germ\u00e1n \u00c1vila wrote in an X message that he would stop using his visa in \u201csolidarity\u201d with Petro, and because of the \u201caggression\u201d he was subjected to by the United States. \u201cTo work for our people, we do not need visas\u201d \u00c1vila wrote.",
      "The U.S. State Department revoked Petro\u2019s visa Friday after he participated in a protest in New York against the war in Gaza, in which Petro called for the creation of an international army to liberate the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.",
      "Holding a megaphone and wearing a kaffiyeh, the traditional Palestinian scarf, Petro called on U.S. soldiers to \u201cdisobey\u201d President Donald Trump\u2019s orders, adding that they should \u201cnot point their rifles against humanity.\"",
      "Hours after the protest, the State Department said on social media that it would cancel Petro\u2019s visa \u201cdue to his reckless and incendiary actions.\u201d",
      "Petro was back in Colombia when the visa announcement was made, after having spent several days in New York attending the U.N. General Assembly. He wrote on X that he \u201cdidn\u2019t care\u201d about the punishment because he is also an Italian citizen, and could possibly travel to the U.S without a visa.",
      "The revocation of Petro\u2019s visa marks a new low in the leftist leader\u2019s relations with the Trump administration, which earlier this month placed Colombia on a list of countries that it says are not fulfilling their international commitments to curb drug trafficking.",
      "Geoff Ramsey, a Colombia analyst at the Atlantic Council, said the foreign minister's decision to ban herself from visiting the United States places more obstacles in the relationship. He said it also reflects an effort by the Petro administration to distance itself from the U.S. government, as Colombia heads into congressional and presidential elections next year.",
      "\u201cPetro is not even remotely interested in repairing the relationship with Washington,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cHe\u2019s clearly betting that confrontation with Trump will score points for his coalition in the upcoming election cycle, and is willing to torch the bilateral relationship with the United States in the process.\u201d",

      "Louisiana has issued a warrant to arrest a California doctor accused of mailing abortion pills",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Louisiana is pursuing a criminal case against another out-of-state doctor accused of mailing abortion pills to a patient in the state, court documents filed this month revealed.",
      "A warrant for the arrest of a California doctor is a rare charge of violating one of the state abortion bans that has taken effect since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and allowed enforcement.",
      "It represents an additional front in a growing legal battle between liberal and conservative states over prescribing abortion medications via telehealth and mailing them to patients.",
      "Pills are the most common way abortions are accessed in the U.S., and are a major reason that, despite the bans, abortion numbers rose last year, according to a report.",
      "Louisiana said in a court case filed Sept. 19 that it had issued a warrant for a California-based doctor who it says provided pills to a Louisiana woman in 2023.",
      "Both the woman, Rosalie Markezich, and the state attorney's general, are seeking to be part of a lawsuit that seeks to order drug regulators to bar telehealth prescriptions to mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions.",
      "In court filings, Markezich says her boyfriend at the time used her email address to order drugs from Dr. Remy Coeytaux, a California physician, and sent her $150, which she forwarded to Coeytaux. She said she had no other contact with the doctor.",
      "She said she did not want to take the pills but felt forced to and said in the filing that \u201cthe trauma of my chemical abortion still haunts me\u201d and that it would not have happened if telehealth prescriptions to the drug were off limits.",
      "The accusation builds on a position taken by anti-abortion groups: That allowing abortion pills to be prescribed by phone or video call and filled by mail opens the door to women being coerced to take them.",
      "\u201cRosalie is bravely representing many woman who are victimized by the illegal, immoral, and unethical conduct of these drug dealers,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said in a statement.",
      "Murrill's office did not immediately answer questions about what charges Coeytaux faces, or when the warrant was issued. But under the state's ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy, physicians convicted of providing abortion face up to 15 years in prison and $200,000 in fines.",
      "Coeytaux is also the target of a lawsuit filed in July in federal court by a Texas man who says the doctor illegally provided his girlfriend with abortion pills.",
      "Email and a telephone message seeking comment were left for Coeytaux.",
      "The combination of a Louisiana criminal case and a Texas civil case over abortion pills is also playing out surrounding a New York doctor, Margaret Carpenter. New York authorities are refusing to extradite Carpenter to Louisiana or to enforce for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton the $100,000 civil judgment against her.",
      "In the Louisiana case, officials said a pregnant minor\u2019s mother requested the abortion medication online and directed her daughter to take them. The mother was arrested, pleaded not guilty and was released on bond.",
      "New York officials cite a law there that seeks to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion medications to patients in states with abortion bans \u2014 or where such prescriptions by telehealth violate the law.",

      "A judiciary subcommittee meeting convened in Charlotte to listen to many speakers who described local court systems in North Carolina and South Carolina that they say have failed to protect the public and keep defendants in jail while awaiting trials.",
      "The meeting was prompted by the Aug. 22 stabbing death of Iryna Zarutska on a light rail car and the resulting apprehension of a suspect who had been previously arrested more than a dozen times, according to court records.",
      "\u201cThe same system that failed Mary failed Iryna. Our hearts are broken for her family and her friends and we grieve with them,\u201d Mia Alderman, the grandmother of 2020 murder victim 20-year-old Mary Santina Collins in Charlotte, told panelists. Alderman said defendants in her granddaughter's case still haven't been tried: \u201cWe need accountability. We need reform. We need to ensure that those accused of heinous crimes are swiftly prosecuted.\u201d",
      "A magistrate had allowed the commuter train defendant, Decarlos Brown Jr., to be released on a misdemeanor charge in January on a written promise to appear, without any bond. Now Brown is jailed after being charged with both first-degree murder in state court and a federal count in connection with Zarutska\u2019s death. Both crimes can be punishable by the death penalty.",
      "Public outrage intensified with the release of security video showing the attack, leading to accusations from Republicans all the way to President Donald Trump that policies by Democratic leaders in Charlotte and statewide are more focused on helping criminals than victims. Democratic committee members argued that Republicans are the ones who have reduced crime-control funds or failed to provide funding for more district attorneys and mental health services. Brown\u2019s mother told media outlets that her son has been diagnosed with schizophrenia.",
      "\u201cThe hearing for me is not really about public safety,\u201d Democratic Rep. Alma Adams, who represents most of Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s about my colleagues trying to paint Democrats as soft on crime \u2014 and we're not \u2014 and engaging in political theater, probably to score some headlines.\u201d",
      "Dena King, a former U.S. attorney for western North Carolina during Joe Biden's administration, testified that Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, needs dozens of additional prosecutors to serve effectively a county of 1.2 million people. And a crime data analyst said that rates of murder and violent crime are falling nationwide and in Charlotte after increases early in the 2020s.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said Monday it will open 13 million acres of federal lands for coal mining and provide $625 million to recommission or modernize coal-fired power plants as President Donald Trump continues his efforts to reverse the years-long decline in the U.S. coal industry.",
      "Actions by the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency follow executive orders Trump issued in April to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that\u2019s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.",
      "Environmental groups denounced the actions, which come as the Trump administration has clamped down on renewable energy, including freezing permits for offshore wind projects, ending clean energy tax credits and blocking wind and solar projects on federal lands.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s orders, the Energy Department has required fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The latest announcement would allow those efforts to expand as a precaution against possible electricity shortfalls.",
      "Trump also has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands. A sweeping tax bill approved by Republicans and signed by Trump reduces royalty rates for coal mining from 12.5% to 7%, a significant decrease that officials said will help ensure U.S. coal producers can compete in global markets.",
      "The new law also mandates increased availability for coal mining on federal lands and streamlines federal reviews of coal leases.",
      "\u201cEverybody likes to say, \u2018drill, baby, drill.\u2019 I know that President Trump has another initiative for us, which is \u2018mine, baby, mine,\u2019\u201d Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at a news conference Monday at Interior headquarters. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Energy Undersecretary Wells Griffith also spoke at the event. All three agencies signed orders boosting coal.",
      "\u201cBy reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,\" Burgum said.",

      "\u201cAmericans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,\" he said.",

      "\u201cSubsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century \u2013 and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cWe need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.''",

      "\"Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,'' said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign.",
      "The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.",
      "Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America\u2019s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to \u201cprotect America\u2019s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.\u201d",
      "Burgum, who also chairs Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure \"abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.''",
      "The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls \u201cbeautiful\u201d coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.",
      "Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.",
      "Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there\u2019s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.",

Roberts is a native of Guyana who entered the United States on a student visa in 1999, according to ICE. He\u2019s being held at an Iowa jail.",
      "ICE said that Roberts fled after a traffic stop in Des Moines, and that he was apprehended with the assistance of the Iowa State Patrol. The agency said that Roberts, 54, had possessed a loaded handgun in his district-issued vehicle, a hunting knife and $3,000 cash when arrested.",
      "Des Moines school officials said they had known nothing about Roberts being in the country illegally. They said that he had signed a form verifying that he was a citizen when he was hired in 2023 and submitted a driver's license and Social Security card to verify his eligibility.",
      "The school board voted 6-0 Monday evening to put Roberts on unpaid leave from his job, which has an annual salary of $286,716. His contract, which the board had voted to extend in May through June 30, 2028, requires that he hold a state certification to serve as superintendent.",

Roberts had a history of gun ownership, however, and had been cited in 2021 in Pennsylvania and fined $100 for storing a loaded hunting rifle in his vehicle.",

    "summary": "His music dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, as an early bandmate of Buddy Holly, and the writer of such classic songs as \"I Fought the Law.\" But Sonny Curtis' most memorable composition may be a TV theme song that turned the world on with a smile.",
    "story": [
      "The theme song to \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" is familiar to generations of TV watchers. The name of the man who wrote and sang it, less so.",
      "Who can turn the world on with her smile?Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?Well, it's you, girl, and you should know itWith each glance and every little movement you show it",
      "Love is all around, no need to waste itYou can have the town, why don't you take itYou're gonna make it after all",
      "But by the time Sonny Curtis recorded \"Love Is All Around\" in 1970, he'd \"made it\" several times over himself, as a songwriter, as a recording artist, and as an early bandmate of the legendary Buddy Holly.",
      "Born in 1937 in rural West Texas, Curtis grew up picking cotton on his father's farm. \"Oh, it was a miserable job,\" he told correspondent Mo Rocca. \"The heavier the cotton sack gets, the worse it is, man.\"",
      "His love of music came from family. His aunt taught him to play the guitar, and while working those fields, Curtis dreamed up his own songs: \"Driving a tractor, you go down half a mile that way, and when you get there, you turn around and come back a half mile this way. You have plenty of time to write a song!\"",
      "Curtis was just 14 when he met a young Buddy Holly in nearby Lubbock. \"Buddy had black hair, but he had dyed it blonde, and it was growing out. And he reminded me of a black-and-tan coon hound. We sorta skipped all the niceties and got our guitars and started playing.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"How quickly did you realize this guy's serious about music?\"",
      "\"Buddy, he exuded confidence. He just knew he was gonna make it big one day.\"",
      "The two became fast friends, bonded by their love of music. Sometimes, Curtis said, he'd spend the night at Buddy's. The two would wake up at midnight and flip on the car radio for a show out of Shreveport, Louisiana, to hear some of the rhythm and blues voices that would shape rock 'n' roll: \"We heard, oh, Big Mama Thornton and Lonnie Johnson, and Lead Belly, Little Richard, Ray Charles, you name it.\"",
      "\"Were you just absorbing this?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"Oh, boy, were we ever, yeah!\"",
      "Buddy and Sonny had formed a band and were still figuring out their own sound, when a then little-known Elvis Presley came to town. \"And I mean, the girls were goin' nuts, man. And that really got our attention. All a sudden, we thought, this not only involves music, this involves pretty girls!\"",
      "When Elvis came back to town in 1956, Buddy and Sonny's band was the opening act. \"Well, I guess we were right there sort of at the beginning of rock 'n' roll.\"",
      "\"What was Elvis like backstage?\" asked Rocca.",
      "\"He was just an old boy.\"",
      "The band went on to record some demos, but wasn't making much money.",
      "So, Curtis left to tour with country star Slim Whitman. \"He treated me kind of like a little brother,\" Curtis said. \"I remember I'd be on the stage and he'd come over and say, 'Now don't be nervous.'\"",
      "Meanwhile, Buddy Holly formed a new band, which would prove to be seminal. The Crickets shot to fame, appearing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show.\"",
      "Rocca asked, \"When that was happening, did you feel a little left out, like, 'Ugh'?\"",
      "\"I did feel kind of like the train left the station and I wasn't on it, you know?\" Curtis replied.",
      "But on February 3, 1959, Curtis' friend and former bandmate died in a plane crash near Clear Lake Iowa.",
      "Curtis served as a pallbearer.",
      "\"Buddy Holly was 22 when he died,\" Rocca said.",
      "\"Yes. Can you imagine the amount of music he pumped into the system in a short period of, like, 18 months? No telling how much he would've contributed had he been around.\"",
      "By that time, Curtis had joined the Crickets. But with Holly gone, the band felt rudderless.",
      "It was Curtis' talent for songwriting that helped put the wind back in his sails. His song \"Walk Right Back'' became a big hit for the Everly Brothers:",
      "And then there's this classic, which Curtis claims he wrote in about 20 minutes: \"I Fought the Law\":",
      "\"I Fought the Law\" has been covered by artists from The Bobby Fuller Four to The Clash.",
      "Sonny Curtis is 84 now. He and Louise, his wife of more than 50 years, live outside Nashville, where they raised their daughter, Sarah. He is enshrined in Nashville's Musicians Hall of Fame \u2013 as is his old guitar.",
      "In 2012, the year the Crickets retired, they were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "But it's a song Curtis wrote for the small screen that may be his most enduring legacy.",
      "In 1970, he was living in Los Angeles when he got a call from a friend about a new sitcom being produced for Mary Tyler Moore: \"It was just this young girl gets jilted in this small community, and she moves to the big city of Minneapolis, gets a job at a news station. And that was about it.\"",
      "Curtis wrote the theme song based on a four-page description of the show. \"I honed in on the part that she rented an apartment she had a hard time affording, and wrote, 'How will you make it on your own?' \u2026 'This world is awfully big, and girl, this time you're all alone.'\"",
      "Within just a few hours, Curtis was summoned to the studio to play his song for producer James L. Brooks. Curtis recalled, \"I got my guitar out and I sang it to him. He smiled and said, 'Sing that again.' And I had to sing it about ten times. And before I left that afternoon, the room was full of people standing all around the walls. I thought, 'I believe I got a shot at this!'\"",
      "WEB EXTRA: Sonny Curtis on writing the \"Mary Tyler Moore Show\" theme song",
      "Rocca said, \"It wasn't a given that you'd write and sing it.\"",
      "\"No. As a matter of fact they didn't want me to sing it. I said, 'I wanna sing this,' you know? And I was probably more pushy than I should have been, if I'da known better. But fortunately, I didn't know better at the time!\"",
      "When the show became a hit, Curtis was asked to rework his song: \"When they started to do the second season, he said, 'Sonny, she's obviously made it. And we have to have some new lyrics.'\"",
      "For a man whose career dates back to the birth of rock 'n' roll, Sonny Curtis remains disarmingly humble. \"Oh, I've always sort of had a rule, don't give advice in a crowd,\" he laughed.",
      "But when pressed, he will share some wisdom: \"If they say, 'Man, you oughta go back to Texas 'cause you'll never make it,' just look at them and say, 'No, you're wrong, because I am gonna make it.'\"",
      "Rocca replied, \"You know, I should write this down, 'cause this sounds like a song right here!\"",

      "Rod Argent and Colin Blunstone are in their 80s now. In their teens they were members of The Zombies, part of the 1960s British pop invasion that began with The Beatles, except that, for The Zombies, success took a lot longer to catch up with them.",
      "Of the five original Zombies, four survive: Argent, Blunstone, Hugh Grundy and Chris White. The fifth member, Paul Atkinson, died in 2004.",
      "\"We were friends, really, right from the very start,\" said Agent.",
      "\"It just clicked, yeah, it really did,\" said Grundy.",
      "White added, \"And we're still friends!\"",
      "They first got the band together at a youth club in their hometown just north of London, where a local artist has now finally put up a mural of them.",
      "But boy, was it a bumpy road to rock 'n' roll immortality.",
      "The first song Argent wrote was \"She's Not There,\" about unrequited adolescent love (is there another kind?). It was the making of them.",
      "\"She's Not There\" made it onto \"Juke Box Jury,\" a British is-it-a-hit-or-a-miss TV show, where one of the panelists loved it: \"I think it's a hit,\" he said. That panelist was George Harrison of The Beatles. It didn't hurt.",
      "The song went to #1 on the Cash Box chart, and #2 in Billboard.",
      "\"It was on the 9 o'clock news,\" said Argent. \"They said The Zombies had become the first group after The Beatles to have a number one record with a self-written composition\" - the song Argent wrote - \"Yeah, I'm in heaven!.\"",
      "\"She's Not There\" wasn't just a hit; it was their ticket to ride. They went to America, and hit the road with the Dick Clark Caravan of Stars. \"This was a dream come true for us,\" said Blunstone.",
      "Grundy said, \"We were terrified because here we were taking a lot of their influence, and there we were on stage with these fabulous artists going, 'Can we do this, can we even play with them?'\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel you were being imposters bringing American-style rhythm and blues music back to America?\"",
      "\"With English accents!\" said White.",
      "\"We thought exactly that,\" Argent replied. \"But they saw us as doing something really quite different. But we realize now that we did really have something quite original. We really did have our own stamp.\"",
      "But there was a problem: Money. There wasn't any.",
      "Blunstone said, \"We were 19 years old, we were very na\u00efve, and we didn't realize what our options were. So, I'm afraid that touring revenue was poor. Sometimes non-existent!\"",
      "Not only that, they felt their music had stagnated and suffered. They decided to produce their own album, in their own way. They went to the mothership of British rock, the famous Abbey Road Studios in London.",
      "Returning there, Blunstone said, \"You do get this really emotional feeling walking into it. Because, I mean, there's so much history in these walls.\"",
      "The session produced what became their signature album, \"Odessey and Oracle,\" now considered one of rock 'n' roll's greats. But not then. Then, it sank without a trace. \"There was no real interest in us,\" Argent said.",
      "Blunstone said, \"I thought we had a chance, but it became fairly clear fairly quickly that the industry pretty much ignored it, really.\"",
      "The Zombies thought it was all over and broke up. Blunstone took a job in insurance. Grundy sold cars. White and Argent wrote songs for other people, including this one for Argent's new band: \"Hold Your Head Up.\"",
      "But \"Odessey and Oracle\" wouldn't die. More than a year later, one of the tracks, \"Time of the Season,\" started to get some play.",
      "\"Famously there was one DJ in Boise, Idaho who kept playing 'Time of the Season,'\" said Blunstone. \"It spread to other radio stations. It took months for it to be a hit, but again, it went to number one in Cash Box.\"",
      "Finally, more than 50 years after their hits, The Zombies made it into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame; and now, a remastered version of \"Odessey and Oracle\" has been released.",
      "\"Now,\" said Blunstone, \"it gets name-checked as a major influence in so many people's careers.\"",
      "\"Considered a Top 50 rock album, iconic rock album,\" I added.",
      "\"I know! And here we are. Is it nearly 70 years later? It's a very strange story.\"",
      "But a story with a happy ending. For The Zombies, their season has finally come.",

    "summary": "The actress talks about playing a screen goddess in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\"; her love of movie musicals; and her long road from the Bronx to Hollywood.",
    "story": [
      "The first thing you notice about Jennifer Lopez' perch over West Hollywood is the Old Hollywood part of it. Images of Barbra Streisand, Bette Davis and the Rat Pack all bedazzle the walls.",
      "\"I love making movies,\" she said, pointing to one photo. \"And I feel like this is me a little bit. But it's not me, it's Sophia Loren! And with the crew there, and this is what my life is: it's me by a camera doing this every day!\"",
      "Lopez is a movie mainstay. She's made at least one film almost every year for the past three decades. Some were memorable, others weren't. Golden Globes and Oscars both eluded her. But this year just might be different, due to \"Kiss of the Spider Woman,\" an old-fashioned musical. \"I just thought to myself, This is what I've been waiting for my whole life,\" she said. \"I grew up on musicals. My mom loved musicals, and so I saw every musical you can think of. She was a fanatic!\"",
      "I asked, \"How many times do you think you saw 'West Side Story'?\"",
      "\"So many,\" she sighed. \"And it wasn't, 'Oh I've seen it about five times.' No! I've seen it hundreds of times! I feel like, so much!\"",
      "No surprise one of her idols is Rita Moreno, the other the late Chita Rivera, who starred in \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" on Broadway \u2013 the same Tony-winning shoes that Lopez is now trying to fill.",
      "Does she feel the weight of that? \"I kind of let it go and understood that I had to make it my own,\" she said.",
      "It came, though, at a tough time in her personal life \u2013 Ben Affleck, her now ex-husband, is one of the film's executive producers. \"It was a really tough time,\" she said. \"Every moment on set, every moment I was doing this role, I was so happy. And then, it was like, back home it was not great. And it was just like, Oh, you know, how do I reconcile this?\"",
      "Their divorce was settled the same month that \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" premiered at Sundance. \"It was the best thing that ever happened to me,\" she said. \"Because it changed me \u2026 It didn't change me, it helped me grow in a way that I needed to grow.\"",
      "The bright music of \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" is a purposeful contrast to the film's darker tale. It's an escape for two cellmates in an Argentinian prison: Molina, a queer window dresser; and Valentin, a proud Marxist revolutionary. Going to a movie in their mind helped ease their drudgery, and dissolve their differences.",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Kiss of the Spider Woman\" click on the video player below:",
      "Lopez said, \"It is a love letter, in a way, to the Latin community and to the queer community, this movie, because in a time like this \u2026 those communities are being demonized and marginalized.\"",
      "Inclusion and acceptance have always been themes in her music. Performing at the 2020 Super Bowl halftime show in Miami, one of her twins, Emme (whom she had with her third husband Marc Anthony), sang with her proudly about the challenges of identity \u2013 cultural and otherwise. \"Singing that with my child there, and them screaming that back to me \u2013 'cause I'm gonna live my life \u2013 that was one of the best moments in my life,\" said Lopez, who then apologized for getting emotional thinking back on that. \"I didn't know it would catch me like that. It was one of the best moments of my life. Being so joyful and happy and being exactly who they were.\"",
      "The kind of global platform that she has now was unimaginable back when, against her parents' wishes, she dropped out of college and ran from her home in the Bronx chasing the city lights of Manhattan.",
      "With no place to stay, she slept on a bench at the Phil Black Dance Studio on Broadway. \"I crashed there for a while,\" she said. \"You know, when you're young you can do stuff like that. You don't know what's gonna happen to you.\"",
      "\"It's not an inconvenience,\" I said.",
      "\"No! You're like, whatever. Great! I can sleep here. I'll sleep here!\"",
      "As a kid, seeing a live Broadway show was a rare privilege, but the experience stuck. \"I remember sitting in an audience, watching a live show one time,\" she said. \"And I was with a friend, and I said, 'When you see that, don't you want to be up there, doing that?' And they were like, 'No!' And I was like, 'Okay. Is it just me?'\"",
      "In-between her auditions, Lopez was selling programs for \"Phantom of the Opera\" out in front of the Majestic Theatre. \"I was, like, really using my best tactics,\" she said. \"Like, I swing it up in the air and, like, you know, kind of try to be charming and funny!\"",
      "It was a winding road that finally got Jennifer Lopez to her own musical. It might just be that going back in time to Old Hollywood \u00a0-- is what pushes her Hollywood career forward.",
      "\"The hard times are the lessons, and you have to understand that,\" she said. \"You have to understand that. And once you do, everything just becomes a little bit lighter. And you can really, really fly.\"",
      "\"Does it feel like you're flying now?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yes. It does. It does,\" she replied. \"And I still feel like I want to fly higher. I want to see more. I want to do more things.\"",

      "\"Each diagnosis, each new case, will be a daunting and at times frightening experience for those individuals and their loved ones,\" Charles wrote in a booklet given to guests at Buckingham Palace event celebrating cancer charities in April 2025. \"But as one among those statistics myself, I can vouch for the fact that it can also be an experience that brings into sharp focus the very best of humanity.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "The U.S. Department of Labor said it would delay releases of economic data if the federal government shuts down\u00a0this week, which could postpone Friday's highly anticipated monthly jobs report.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department posted a 73-page \"contingency plan\" detailing operations if government funding lapses at midnight on Sept. 30. If that occurs, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) would suspend all operations, including data collection activities for BLS surveys, website updates and economic reports, the plan states.",
      "The BLS is scheduled to release its report on September employment gains on Oct. 3. In a shutdown, government agencies must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded from other sources, such as fees, or under other legislation.",
      "The BLS' closely watched monthly jobs report drew scrutiny last month when President Trump\u00a0fired its commissioner of labor statistics after disappointing employment numbers. At the same time, the Federal Reserve has signaled it is closely watching the labor market for signs of weakness amid a hiring slowdown.",

      "Although it's unclear whether a shutdown will occur or how long it could last, the possibility raises the risk that some government economic reports would not be available to the Fed before its next meeting on Oct. 29, he added.",
      "\"In our view, an increasingly data dependent Federal Reserve with limited visibility into the September data increases the probability of an October pause,\" meaning that the Fed could hold off on an additional rate cut at the Oct. 29 meeting, Reid\u00a0wrote.",

      "\"We believe that a shutdown will have only a small and transitory economic impact, but it may spur some financial market volatility, especially if delays in government economic reports obscure the path of Federal Reserve's interest-rate cuts,\" said Jennifer Timmerman, investment strategy analyst, in a Wells Fargo Investment Institute\u00a0report\u00a0released Monday.",

    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan published by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

    "summary": "While the tariffs will impact everyone to some degree, experts say more of the pain will be felt by lower-income consumers.",
    "story": [
      "Fresh tariffs on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities recently announced by President Trump on social media\u00a0could cause already high prices to rise even further, and deter some Americans from embarking on home renovation projects.",
      "Mr. Trump on Thursday said his administration will levy a 50% tariff on all imported kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and \"associated products,\" plus a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture from abroad.",
      "Preventing what he called the \"flooding\" of such goods into the U.S. is a matter of national security, the president added. Both sets of tariffs will kick in Oct. 1, he said. \"It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "Prices for living room, kitchen and dining room furniture \u2014 much of which is imported \u2014 rose 9.5% from August 2024 to August 2025,\u00a0the latest CPI data shows, driven by Mr. Trump's country-based tariffs, according to economists.\u00a0Furniture and bedding also rose 4.7% over the same period, and 2.8% for household furnishings and supplies.",
      "If the new levies go into effect, furniture makers will feel the hit, and some will likely pass the costs on to consumers, industry analysts told CBS News. The sectoral tariffs could also hinder business activity and growth, they added, as companies wait to see if tariff policies change and defer investment decisions.",
      "\"Higher prices are an inevitable consequence of these tariffs,\" Zak Stambor, a retail analyst at market research company eMarketer, told CBS News. \"People undergoing bathroom or kitchen renovations are in a tough spot right now because there was so little warning. The costs of those things will now be higher, and people might not have already bought them because they were waiting for permits.\"",
      "Low-income consumers will feel the squeeze the most, not just because they have less discretionary income but because lower-cost furniture sold in the U.S. tends to be imported from Southeast Asian countries such as Sri Lanka, Vietnam, Malaysia and India.",
      "Some higher-end furniture is manufactured in the U.S., and therefore less exposed to tariffs, according to Telsey Advisory Group managing director and senior retail analyst Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez. She said retailers will have no choice but to raise prices on imported goods once the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"They are trying not to raise prices too much ahead of holiday season. But they can't absorb 30% tariffs on top of other tariffs that are already in place,\" she told CBS News. \"They'll have to pass through pricing, probably in the form of a double-digit price increase.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to CBS News's request for comment on analysts' claims the tariffs could drive up prices or inhibit business investment.",
      "Uncertainty persists",
      "From retailers' point of view, the levies could make investing in new inventory a riskier and more difficult proposition, according to Stambor, as costs and consumer demand could shift.",
      "\"Retailers' only certainty is that uncertainty is here to stay. What's true today very well may not be true tomorrow and that makes life incredibly challenging,\" he said.",
      "Naturepedic, an Ohio-based maker of organic mattresses and bedroom furniture, said it had been planning to launch an upholstered product line in late 2025 or early 2026, including headboards. However, as of Thursday, it is reconsidering that expansion.",
      "\"We are having to go back to the drawing board a little bit,\" Naturepedic Chief Growth Officer Arin Schultz told CBS News. \"We might drop it if it doesn't make sense, even though we're pretty far along in the process.\"",
      "Of the tariffs announced on Thursday, he said, \"If they could turn around and not do it, that would be great.\"",
      "Cost to consumers",
      "John Mercer, head of global research at Coresight Research, a provider of retail industry insights, doesn't expect all manufacturers to pass on all tariff-related costs to the consumer, and says some will likely take steps to mitigate the impact.",
      "Firms with larger inventories will be able to sell through what they have in stock before implementing any price hikes, while on-demand furniture makers may have to raise prices sooner, rather than later, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump has promoted tariffs as a way of reducing trade deficits with other nations and bolstering domestic jobs in manufacturing.",
      "Mercer, however, doesn't expect the levies to compel makers of upholstered furniture and cabinetry to quickly move production to the U.S.",
      "\"Generally, that's not easy, and it's more expensive,\" he said. \"There is a reason why companies have offshored production, and that's because because it's traditionally much cheaper.\"",

      "The contamination problem was discovered after Hillshire received multiple consumer complaints, the service notes, five of which involved injuries. The company later determined that a \"limited number\" of these products included \"extraneous pieces of wooden stick within the batter,\" Tyson said in a corresponding announcement, adding that it opted to initiate a recall \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "The recalled corn dogs and sausage-on-a-stick goods were produced between March 17 and as recently as Friday, per Saturday's recall notices. Tyson, which is headquartered in Arkansas, said the issue was isolated to one facility located in Haltom City, Texas.",
      "FSIS is worried that some of these recalled products may be in consumers' refrigerators and freezers in households across the U.S., as well as some schools and other institutions. In addition to being sold online and to retailers nationwide, the agency noted Saturday, these products were also sold to school districts and Defense Department facilities.",
      "Consumers in possession of the recalled items are urged to throw them away or return them to their place of purchase.",
      "To determine which corn dogs and other sausage goods are subject to this recall, consumers should check the product's name, use-by dates and other identifying information published online by the FSIS and Tyson. The products being recalled should also have an establishment number of \"EST-582\" or \"P-894\" printed on the packaging.",

      "Part of the reason estimates vary is that the ultra-wealthy are not required or incentivized to disclose their net worth. The SEC requires investors to report ownership of more than 5% of a company's shares, but valuations fluctuate with the market, complicating wealth estimates.",
      "Adjusted for inflation, the number of billionaires with a Rockefeller-sized fortune is a much smaller set.",
      "His $1 billion in 1916 would be worth roughly $30 billion today. By that measure, only about 30 American billionaires have a similar fortune, according to Forbes and\u00a0Bloomberg. Among them are Oracle founder Larry Ellison and Tesla founder Elon Musk, with net worths above $300 billion. Other tech titans also top the list, including Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos \u2014 both with fortunes of over $200 billion each, as of Sept. 29.",
      "Christopher Nichols, a professor of history at Ohio State University said, \"The billionaires of the Gilded Age and the multimillionaires were involved in what we think of as blue chip industries, where there are lots of jobs and stuff produced. The billionaires of today's world are mostly working in tech sectors and places that very often don't employ many people.\"",
      "Billionaires have roughly $6.8 trillion in wealth in 2025",
      "Together, America's billionaires had an approximate total net worth of $6.8 trillion in the spring of 2025, Forbes estimates, which is a jump of more than a trillion compared to last year after a strong year of growth for U.S. stocks in 2024.",
      "In the 20th century, Scottish journalist B.C. Forbes, who founded the eponymous magazine, wrote that if Rockefeller's wealth \"could be turned into cash and distributed equally\u2014which it couldn't\u2014[it] would give every man, woman and child in the United States $10 each.\"",
      "Today, if that estimated $6.8 trillion held by U.S. billionaires could be turned into cash and divided equally among roughly 340 million Americans, it would amount to about $20,000 per person.",
      "Another way to think about that sum is that it could theoretically be used to buy every NFL team, pay off Americans' student loan and medical debt\u00a0and purchase 9 million homes at the current median sales price, with hundreds of billions left over.",
      "The ultra rich own an increasingly large share of the nation's wealth",
      "Data from the World Inequality Database shows that the share of wealth held by the top 1% and the ultra-rich top 0.001% has been rising for decades \u2014 toward the record levels observed in the Gilded Age.",
      "The share of the national wealth held by the top 1% peaked at nearly 50% in 1929 before tumbling during the Great Depression, according to the data.",
      "\"What happened with the Great Depression was that large fortunes were lost in the stock market. And then the New Deal rebuilt the economy around workers and around small businesses,\" said Jeremi Suri, a professor of history and public affairs at University of Texas.",
      "But in the early 1980s, the top 1% began regaining ground, as union jobs declined and traditional industries like manufacturing shrunk, according to Suri.",
      "By 2023 the top 1%, or those with over $4.6 million in assets, controlled more than a third of the nation's wealth \u2014 up over 10 percentage points from 1980.",
      "Data collected by the same researchers shows that the trendline looks similar for those in the top 0.001% of people in the country \u2014 or those who owned more than $1.5 billion in 2023.",
      "The hundreds of billionaires in this category owned about 1% of the nation's net wealth in 1980 and 5% in 2023.",
      "Most billionaires are males with self-made fortunes, but a significant number inherited their money",
      "Demographically, the billionaire class still resembles J.D. Rockefeller in many ways.",
      "The vast majority of the world's billionaires are men \u2014 about 86.5% in 2025, according to Forbes \u2014 and most make rather than inherit their wealth.",
      "Rockefeller himself was the son of a traveling salesman and a housewife. While his family helped him launch his career, Rockefeller built the majority of his fortune on his own, according to Nichols, an editor of \"A Companion to the Gilded Age and Progressive Era.\"",
      "\"He came from enough middle class wealth that he could get a loan from his dad to start that business, which so often is the story for business folks,\" Nichols said. \"But he made his billions through his business acumen and hard work, and then also his ruthless competitiveness in an under-regulated time.\"",
      "Research suggests inheritance plays a significant role for many wealthy people today. Roughly 30% of the world's billionaires have inherited their fortunes, according to a 2024 report by UBS, a wealth management company in Sweden. And the share in the U.S. is about a third, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of Altrata data.",
      "Some of America's wealthiest heirs include Walmart's Alice, Rob and Jim Walton, and Jacqueline Mars, who owns roughly one third of the candy giant Mars founded by her grandfather.",
      "Rockefeller and his son gave away a significant amount of their money to charity but it continues to live on. And descendants of the family share a fortune valued around $10.3 billion in 2024.",

    "summary": "\"I am very happy doing what I am doing,\" says one young electrician who pursued a skilled trade as AI disrupts the job market for college grads.",
    "story": [
      "At just 23, Jacob Palmer is already running his own electrical company. He launched the business in 2024 after starting in the field as an apprentice electrician, a career path he embarked on when college turned out not to be for him.",
      "Palmer has no regrets about his decision to forego college and instead establish himself as a tradesman. \"I am very happy doing what I am doing now because it has given me the opportunity to work for myself and be independent,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Experts say the skilled trades \u2014 jobs like electricians, plumbers, welders, masons, HVAC technicians and other occupations requiring extensive training and often licensing \u2014 are attracting a growing number of young people put off by high tuition costs.",
      "More than 57% of Gen Zers surveyed by Jobber, a software tool for service businesses, cite student loan debt as a concern about going to college, according to the company's annual report on attitudes toward blue collar jobs.",
      "More recently, signs that\u00a0artificial intelligence is starting to gobble up the kind of entry-level jobs that once went to young college graduates are also leading young workers to consider the trades. Some 77% of Gen Zers say it's important that their future job is hard to automate, with many pointing to professions like carpenter, plumber, and electrician as occupations they believe are safe from automation. By contrast, they see less security in fields like software development, data analytics, and accounting according to the survey.",
      "\"That route is losing some of the stigma,\" said David Asay, president of Advantage Reline, a trenchless pipe rehabilitation company in Mesa, Arizona. \"The perception among that younger group is no longer, 'Oh, you're working construction, you didn't go to school?' It's, 'What a cool skillset. You're making a good career path.'\"",
      "Harder path for college grads",
      "For decades, many young people shunned the trades, with everyone from economists and career experts to politicians and parents emphasizing the importance of obtaining a college diploma. That conventional wisdom isn't entirely wrong \u2014 it's just behind the times.",
      "\"The attitude was that jobs in the trades were less than desirable,\" said Angie Hicks, co-founder of Angi, an online home improvement services guide told CBS News.",
      "But several factors are contributing to a shift in how people are thinking about such occupations. For one, going to college for many Americans often requires going into debt. The average cost of college, including tuition and room and board, now tops\u00a0$38,000 a year and is approaching $60,000 for private institutions, according to the Education Data Initiative.",
      "Factoring in the added burden of interest on student loans and potential income one foregoes while in school, the total cost of earning a bachelor's degree can exceed $500,000, the research firm has found.",
      "More recently, economists also point to a jump in unemployment for recent college grads, which some experts say is an early warning sign that AI is taking jobs away from less experienced workers. The jobless rate for 23-to-27-year-old college grads this year now hovers around 4.6%, up from 3.2% for the same demographic in 2019.",
      "Strikingly, non-college-educated workers in the same age range have experienced a much smaller uptick in unemployment, at roughly 0.5%, over the same period, according to an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "\"AI can't go out in the field\"",
      "Vinnie Curcie, founder and CEO of OC Solar, a solar installation company in Irvine, California, said the solar energy field differs from other trades in that the work requires time both in the office and in the field. OC Solar offers three main services \u2014 solar panel and battery sales, project management and installation services. But he expects AI will soon handle much of the sales and project management sides of the business.",
      "While prospective employees once tended to have stronger interest in the company's marketing, management or other white-collar roles, more job candidates today are eager for roles in the field.",
      "\"More people are interested in the field because they know that's where the job security is,\" Curcie told CBS News.",
      "Some school districts also report seeing growing student interest in blue-collar careers. Marlo Loria, director of career and technical education and innovative partnerships at Mesa Public Schools in Mesa, Arizona, said more of her students are enrolling in schools' welding, construction and auto shop programs than there is space for.",
      "Asay, of Advantage Reline, added that students with an entrepreneurial bent can also be well-suited for the skilled trades.",
      "\"They can take their skills and create their own business, or become a bigger part of our business, outside of being someone with a shovel in a trench,\" he said.",
      "Palmer said his business generated $90,000 in revenue in its first year and is on track to top $150,000 in 2025, a more than 30% increase \u2014 no college degree needed. The other upside to life as an electrician, as he sees it, is the job security.",
      "\"I don't feel overly threatened by the growth of AI in my industry. That will be a pretty impressive robot that can do my job one day, if it ever happens,\" Palmer said.",
      "Kayden Evans, an 18-year-old senior at Mountain View High School in Mesa, Arizona, has his eyes set on a career working with his hands, and to eventually start his own business. Currently an intern at Empire Cat, a company that sells, rents and services heavy equipment and tractors, he plans on going straight from high school into an apprenticeship with the company.",
      "\"I wouldn't say I am worried about AI because where I want to grow is as a field technician, and even though it helps, I don't think AI can take that over,\" he said. \"AI can't go out in the field and take apart an engine.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "Under a new law, many Americans will have to meet a work requirement to obtain and keep their Medicaid coverage. But due to an exemption, millions living in areas of high unemployment could be spared.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of Medicaid enrollees may have a way out of the new federal work requirement \u2014 if they live in a county with high unemployment.",
      "By January 2027, President Trump's far-reaching domestic policy law will require many adult, nondisabled Medicaid enrollees in 42 states and Washington, D.C., to work or volunteer 80 hours a month or go to school.",
      "But under the law, Medicaid enrollees in counties where unemployment is at least 8% or 1.5 times the national unemployment rate could be shielded from the work requirement, if their state applies for an exemption.",
      "A new analysis by KFF shows that exemption in the GOP's work requirement could offer a reprieve to potentially millions of Americans caught in a tough spot \u2014 needing to work to secure health insurance but having trouble finding a job.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office projected the work requirement would apply to 18.5 million Medicaid enrollees, causing about 5.3 million to lose their government health coverage by 2034. CBO spokesperson Caitlin Emma confirmed to KFF Health News that analysts factored the unemployment rate exemption into their projections. Only states that expanded Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act or a special waiver must enact a work requirement, under the federal law.",
      "But how many people could be exempt depends on how the Trump administration interprets the law, in addition to whether their states' officials apply.",
      "For example, if Trump officials exempt people in counties where the unemployment rate has been above the law's thresholds for any month over a 12-month period, about 4.6 million Medicaid enrollees in 386 counties could qualify for an exemption today based on the latest unemployment data, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "That amounts to just under a quarter of all Medicaid enrollees subject to the work requirement.",
      "Under that one-month threshold, \"the impact could be fairly significant,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, a co-author of the analysis and the deputy director of KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "But, she said, the Trump administration is more likely to adopt a stricter threshold based on average unemployment over a 12-month period. That would align with work requirements under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the food assistance commonly known as food stamps.",
      "Only about 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees living in 158 counties could be exempted under that standard, or about 7% of the total subject to work requirements, KFF found. That's about 7% of enrollees who live in expansion states who would otherwise need to meet the new requirement.",
      "Based on the 12-month criteria, about 90% of Medicaid enrollees who could be exempted based on high unemployment reside in five states, according to KFF: California, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, and Ohio. California alone accounts for over half of those who could be exempted.",
      "The unemployment rate exemption is one of several carve-outs from the Medicaid work requirement in the GOP's law. The law also exempts parents with children under 14, people who are disabled or frail, and those who are pregnant, incarcerated, or in a substance use disorder program, among others. The high unemployment provision is different than most because it exempts people living in entire counties.",
      "Two top Republicans key to the bill's passage \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson and Sen. Mike Crapo, chair of the Senate Finance Committee \u2014 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "To qualify for the Medicaid exemption, states would have to apply to the federal government on behalf of individuals in eligible counties. And if a county earned an exemption, the government would determine how long it applies.",
      "Even if the federal government grants exemptions broadly, health advocates fear some Republican-led states could balk at applying for exemptions in order to keep enrollment down, as they say has been the case with SNAP exemptions. As of 2023, 18 states did not have an exemption under the SNAP program, even though some of their residents might be eligible.",
      "\"It's not a guarantee that people can rely on,\" said Emily Beauregard, executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group that intends to push for the broadest possible exemptions to help people maintain their coverage. Eastern Kentucky has several counties with perennially high unemployment.",
      "In advocating for Mr. Trump's bill, many Republicans in Washington argued that most people who gained Medicaid benefits under the Affordable Care Act should be working to get off of government assistance.",
      "But as Georgia's and Arkansas' experiences have shown, Medicaid work requirements can be costly for states to run and frustrating for enrollees to navigate. About 18,000 people in Arkansas, or nearly a quarter of the state's adults who gained Medicaid coverage through the ACA expansion, lost coverage when the state had a work requirement in 2018 and 2019. A court ended the state's work requirement program.",
      "Critics point out that most Medicaid enrollees already work or have a disability or caregiving responsibilities, and they argue the reporting requirements merely serve as a bureaucratic hurdle to obtaining and keeping coverage. Under the GOP law, enrollees' work status needs to be verified at least twice a year.",
      "Most of the coverage losses due to work requirements occur among people who work or should qualify for an exemption but nevertheless lose coverage due to red tape, research shows.",
      "Not every state must implement a work requirement under Mr. Trump's law, only those that chose to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income people through the ACA or a federal waiver. The ACA has provided hundreds of billions in federal dollars to help states cover everyone making up to 138% of the federal poverty level \u2014 $21,597 for an individual in 2025.",
      "Forty states and Washington, D.C., took up the expansion. Georgia and Wisconsin partly expanded their Medicaid eligibility by getting a federal waiver, adding them to the list of states subject to the work requirement. These two states were not included in the KFF analysis because of a lack of county-level enrollment data.",
      "Jennifer Wagner, director of Medicaid eligibility and enrollment at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said she is pleased the law makes some exceptions for places where jobs are scarce. It could limit how many people lose coverage because of the work requirement, she said.",
      "Wagner said SNAP's unemployment rate exemption has helped millions of people avoid losing their food assistance, but its impact also depends on whether a state seeks the waiver.",
      "She is concerned the Trump administration may make it difficult for counties to get exempted under the Medicaid law.",
      "\"I'm glad it's in there as it will certainly help people, but it's still a terrible bill,\" she said. \"This will not really blunt the harm of the bill.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture is warning consumers not to eat certain ready-to-eat pasta meals sold at Walmart and Trader Joe's stores because they may be contaminated with listeria bacteria previously linked to a deadly outbreak tied to pre-made chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals.",
      "In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.",
      "In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with \"best if used by\" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection. The stores possibly affected are in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah, Trader Joe's said Friday.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store. Trader Joe's told customers to discard the product or return it to their local store for a full refund.",
      "\"We are issuing this guidance in an abundance of caution because testing of another brand with a shared ingredient source indicated this product may have the potential to be contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes,\" Trader Joe's said on its website. \"There have been no positive Listeria tests for the Trader Joe's product itself, and there have been no reports of illness associated with these production codes.\"",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",
      "FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.",
      "\"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "The pasta came from Nate's Fine Foods of Roseville, California. The company did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press.",
      "Listeria infections can cause serious illness, particularly in older adults, people with weakened immune systems, and those who are pregnant or their newborns. Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.",
      "About 1,600 people get sick each year from listeria infections and about 260 die, the CDC says. Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked to Boar's Head deli meats that led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",

      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",

      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",

      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits.

      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",

      "The move by Bondi \u2014 which she hinted at on Friday \u2014 came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an ICE facility or immigration agent in recent months. She cast that attack as the latest act of \"extreme political violence.\"",
      "In a memo shared on X, Bondi said the FBI, DEA, U.S. Marshals Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives should \"immediately direct all necessary officers and agents to defend ICE facilities and personnel whenever and wherever they come under attack.\" She also announced the formation of a temporary \"ICE Protection Task Force\" that could include federal, state and local law enforcement agencies.",
      "She singled out Portland and Chicago for operations to protect ICE facilities, and said she's directing federal prosecutors in both cities to seek charges against anybody accused of threatening or assaulting law enforcement. President Trump is also looking to deploy\u00a0hundreds of troops\u00a0to the two cities, drawing vehement opposition from local officials.",
      "ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Sep 2025 00:10:58 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump floated a framework to end the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accepted \u2014 though it's unclear how Hamas will respond.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump offered up a 20-point plan Monday that he cast as a roadmap to end the Israel-Hamas war, a proposal that was backed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u2014 though it remains unclear how Hamas will respond.",
      "The plan \u2014 which was presented as Netanyahu visited the White House \u2014 calls for Hamas to return all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and for Israel's military to begin withdrawing from parts of the Gaza Strip in phases. It proposes handing over parts of Gaza to a \"technocratic\" committee and deploying a temporary security force backed by Arab states.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a joint press conference with Netanyahu that his goal is to ensure a \"sustainable, long-term peace.\"",
      "Israel and Hamas have been at war since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. Since then, Israel has waged an intense aerial bombardment and ground campaign in the Gaza Strip. More than 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were civilians or militants.",
      "Netanyahu said Monday he supports the plan, which \"achieves our war aims.\" He said if Hamas does not accept the offer, \"Israel will finish the job by itself.\"",
      "Hamas has not yet responded to the proposal. Qatar's prime minister and Egypt's intelligence chief met with negotiators from Hamas, who said they would review the proposal \"in good faith\" and provide a response, a White House official told CBS News.",
      "Some unanswered questions about the plan still linger, including the exact timing of possible Israeli withdrawals from Gaza and the involvement of different international partners.",
      "Israel and Hamas would stop fighting, trade hostages and prisoners",
      "The plan calls for an immediate end to fighting if both Israel and Hamas agree to the plan, with Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip immediately withdrawing to an \"agreed upon line.\"",
      "\"During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal,\" the plan states.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel accepting the deal, which Netanyahu appeared to do Monday, Hamas is expected to free all remaining hostages. Some 50 hostages are still in Gaza, fewer than half of whom are believed to be alive, according to Israeli authorities.",
      "In exchange, Israel is expected to release 250 Palestinians serving life sentences, as well as 1,700 other Gazans who were detained following the start of the current conflict. The plan calls for the remains of 15 deceased Gazans to be returned for every one deceased hostage. The Israeli releases would take place after the hostages are released by Hamas.",
      "The plan calls for Gaza to be demilitarized \"under the supervision of independent monitors,\" with any weapons factories and tunnels destroyed and weapons decommissioned.",
      "\"A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people,\" one of the 20 points states.",
      "Aid and economic development would enter Gaza",
      "The plan states \"full aid will be immediately sent\" to Gaza, which has faced severe food shortages and has fallen into famine in some regions, according to the world's leading authority on food crises.",
      "It calls for aid deliveries that are at least equal to the levels agreed upon during a prior two-month ceasefire that began in January, with supplies flowing through the Rafah border crossing in southern Gaza. It also states the plan would involve \"rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries.\"",
      "It states aid would be distributed by \"international institutions not associated in any manner with either party,\" including the United Nations and the Red Crescent. The plan does not mention the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a controversial U.S.- and Israeli-backed group that has handled many aid deliveries in the territory in recent months, whose members have been repeatedly accused of firing at Palestinians trying to get aid.",
      "The proposal also floats convening a \"panel of experts\" that could draw up economic redevelopment plans for the Gaza Strip. It states Gaza would exist in a \"special economic zone\" with \"preferred tariff and access rates.\"",
      "Gaza to be led by \"technocratic\" group and stabilization force, not Hamas",
      "After Israel withdraws from parts of Gaza, the plan calls for the territory to be governed by neither Hamas nor the Palestinian Authority, which currently oversees much of the West Bank.",
      "Instead, the enclave would be governed by a \"technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza.\" It's not clear who would participate in that committee, but the plan states it would be composed of \"qualified Palestinians and international experts.\"",
      "Overseeing this new governing structure would be a \"Board of Peace\" chaired by Mr. Trump.",
      "In a press conference Monday, the president said he's slated to lead the board \"not at my request, believe me. I'm very busy. But we have to make sure this works.\"",
      "The plan also envisions an \"International Stabilization Force\" that would temporarily oversee security in Gaza. This group would be backed by the U.S. and Arab states, and tasked with training \"vetted Palestinian Police forces\" in collaboration with Jordan and Egypt.",
      "It states Hamas would need to \"agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form.\" But Hamas members would get amnesty if they \"commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons,\" and members of the group who want to leave the territory would be able to do so.",
      "The plan would also \u2014 at least temporarily \u2014 sideline the Palestinian Authority, which has played a key part in security and governance in the occupied Palestinian territories since the 1990s. The authority is dominated by Fatah, a political movement that has long been at odds with Hamas, and it has not governed Gaza since Hamas took over the strip in 2007.",
      "Netanyahu has long criticized the Palestinian Authority. He said Monday the group would have \"no role whatsoever in Gaza without undergoing a radical and genuine transformation,\" including changes to its education system and an end to a long-controversial stipend system for the families of Palestinian militants.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. The Gaza Strip was also occupied in 1967, though Israel withdrew from the territory and removed its settlements in 2005. The territory has been under a tight Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas' 2007 takeover.",
      "Israel would withdraw from Gaza and won't annex territory",
      "The Israel Defense Forces would immediately withdraw from part of Gaza after a deal is reached. It would continue to withdraw from parts of the territory and hand over control to the new International Stabilization Force \"based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization.\"",
      "Israeli forces would remain present in a \"security perimeter,\" however, until Gaza \"is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat,\" the plan states. Netanyahu said Monday the IDF would remain in that perimeter \"for the foreseeable future.\"",
      "If Hamas doesn't accept the proposal, it calls for the plan to \"proceed in the terror-free areas\" that are handed over from the Israeli military to the new stabilization force.",
      "Plan calls statehood an \"aspiration of the Palestinian people\"",
      "The proposal does not lay out a clear roadmap for an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But it says that, if the plan works out, \"the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.\"",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, and has castigated U.S. allies like the United Kingdom and France for recognizing a Palestinian state last week at the United Nations General Assembly, calling it an \"absurd prize for terrorism.\" Mr. Trump has also opposed calls for a Palestinian state. But key Arab partners have backed Palestinian statehood and cast it as a necessary component of any long-term resolution.",
      "The plan also pushes for an \"interfaith dialogue process\" to \"try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis,\" and a \"dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence.\"",

If you had a concern about safety at your own home, you'd make a few calls and fill the gaps \u2014 not call in an army. What we're seeing is not about public safety, it's about the President flexing political muscle under the guise of law and order, chasing a media hit at the expense of our community.\"",

      "Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, a majority. But with 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber, Republicans can't approve a bill to fund the government without the help of Democrats.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats have been pushing to extract a more favorable outcome in the spending fight, facing pressure from their base to push back on the Trump administration's policies. But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "Democratic leaders have been pushing for a meeting with Mr. Trump on government funding. And the leaders are set to meet Monday with the president, alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Then, the Trump administration upped the ante last week, when the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he called Thune Friday and urged him to get the leaders together for a meeting. The next day, he said the White House told them the meeting was on for Monday afternoon.",
      "The New York Democrat called the meeting a \"first step,\" saying \"we need a serious negotiation.\"",
      "\"I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,\" Schumer said. \"But the fundamental question hasn't been answered yet, and we'll see on Monday: are they serious about negotiating with us in a real way?\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position, telling CBS News \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "The shutdown blame game",
      "Democrats and Republicans have preempted the possible shutdown in recent days, seeking to put the blame on the other party should Congress fail to fund the government \u2014 forcing federal agencies to halt non-essential functions.",
      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",
      "But that was before Republicans in Congress approved their \"big, beautiful bill,\" which included restrictions to Medicaid that Democrats vehemently opposed, along with a rescissions package clawing back more than $9 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting. Now, Schumer's posture appears to be different as well.",

    "summary": "The possibility of a shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "During a government shutdown, all active-duty personnel, as well as National Guard who are currently deployed, must carry out their assigned duties with their pay delayed until the shutdown is over. Civilian personnel whose work the Defense Department considers essential, or \"excepted,\" will also continue to work, while other civilians are furloughed for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "\"After the government shutdown, all government employees will automatically receive back pay, based on the terms of the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019,\" said Seamus Daniels, a fellow for Defense Budget Analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it's unlikely to pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care would be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

A month later, X agreed to pay Mr. Trump $10 million to settle its lawsuit, which was filed before billionaire Trump ally Elon Musk bought the platform.",
      "The lawsuit against YouTube argued that the suspension violated Mr. Trump's First Amendment rights because it was allegedly done \"in response to coercion of the federal government.\" Attorneys for the tech firm had called that argument \"meritless\" in a 2021 court filing, and said forcing the platform to host Mr. Trump without any restrictions \"would conflict with YouTube's own First Amendment rights.\"",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position.",
      "\"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue,\" Mr. Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump also expressed confidence that the American people will side with him if government funding expires in the coming days, and he believes Democrats will pay a political price for not working with him, on his terms, to further cut spending.",
      "\"They're not interested in fraud, waste and abuse,\" Mr. Trump said of the Democrats.",
      "Mr. Trump will meet Monday with congressional leaders ahead of the Oct. 1 deadline for lawmakers to reach an agreement on a spending bill that would avert a shutdown.",
      "A source close to Mr. Trump told CBS News that the president privately welcomes the prospect of a shutdown because it will enable him to wield executive power to slash some government programs and salaries.",
      "Last week, the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies telling them to prepare layoff plans if there is a government shutdown.",
      "The memo, obtained by CBS News, tells agencies to consider reduction-in-force notices \u2014 a federal term for layoffs \u2014 for employees in programs, projects or activities that have discretionary funding that stops on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. It also goes further and says that employees should get RIF notices if they're in programs or projects \"not consistent with the President's priorities.\"",
      "In the interview Sunday, Mr. Trump cast the Democrats' current demands \u2014\u00a0 which in recent weeks have focused on seeking to extend Affordable Care Act insurance subsidies \u2014\u00a0 as ill-advised.",
      "Instead, Mr. Trump said, if the Democrats want to discuss health care, they should work with him to prevent undocumented migrants from accessing public benefits.",
      "\"The Democrats, incredibly, want to keep their old policies of open borders and we're not going to have it. We're not going to allow it,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Any possible health-care negotiations, Mr. Trump added, must address immigration and border-related matters, otherwise, \"It's just not acceptable for us.\"",
      "Democrats have forcefully pushed back against Mr. Trump's characterization of their positions on both government funding and on immigration. And they have repeatedly noted that people who are in the U.S. illegally are not eligible to receive Medicaid coverage.",

And no one is trying to change or reverse that law,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told MSNBC on Saturday. \"What we are doing is fighting to protect the healthcare of everyday Americans in the midst of this Republican-caused crisis that is devastating hospitals and nursing homes and community-based health clinics.\"",

But Democrats put forward their own proposal that would keep the government funded until Oct. 31, along with implementing other priorities for the party, including their health-care request. In the Senate, where 60 votes are needed to advance most legislation, both the bill passed by the House\u00a0to fund the government and the Democrats' proposal fell short.",
      "The Democrats' proposal included a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The proposal would also roll back cuts to Medicaid in Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "The Senate is returning to Washington on Monday after a weeklong recess, and will have little time to act to avert a shutdown. Echoing Mr. Trump, Thune told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that it's \"totally up to the Democrats\" whether the government shuts down, saying \"there is a bill sitting at the desk in the Senate right now\" that the House passed that would keep the government open.",

    "summary": "The U.S. government could shut down on Wednesday if Congress fails to approve funding for federal agencies. Here's how that could affect Social Security recipients.",
    "story": [
      "Even if a U.S.\u00a0government shutdown begins on Oct. 1, the 74 million Americans who collect Social Security will continue receiving their monthly checks, although some services could be disrupted due to a potential halt in federal activities, according to experts.",
      "Social Security benefits are covered by mandatory spending, which means that the funding for the program has already been approved by Congress without an expiration date. As a result, Social Security recipients including retirees, disabled Americans and the dependents of deceased workers wouldn't see an interruption in their monthly payments if the government shuts down.",
      "However, other Social Security services could be impacted by a shutdown, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare. The Social Security Administration's working budget requires approval from Congress, with lawmakers currently at loggerheads over funding the federal government past Sept. 30.",
      "If an agreement isn't reached before then, some Social Security services could be temporarily halted until the issue is resolved, according to both the Social Security Administration and experts on the retirement program.",
      "\"The system hasn't missed a payment in its entire 90-year history and won't start now,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare said in an email. \"But customer service at the Social Security Administration (SSA) may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing, and replacing Medicare cards.\"",
      "In preparation for past shutdowns, each federal agency has created a contingency plan for their operations, with some employees expected to work without pay because they're considered to be providing essential services.",
      "In an email to CBS News, the SSA said beneficiaries would continue to receive payments even if the government closes.",
      "\"In the event of a lapse in appropriation, SSA will follow the contingency plan for continued activities, and Social Security beneficiaries would continue receiving their Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance, and SSI payments,\" an agency spokesperson said.",
      "When is the next Social Security payment?",
      "Social Security payments would continue to go out as usual during a shutdown, with recipients of Supplemental Security Income \u2014 a program for low-income and disabled people \u2014 scheduled to receive their next checks on Oct. 1.",
      "Social Security recipients will receive their checks on their usual schedule, which is based on their birth date. Those born between the 1st to 10th of their birth month will receive payment on Oct. 8, while those born between the 11th to 20th days will receive their payment on Oct. 15. People born between the 21st and the last day of their birth month will get their check on Oct. 22.",
      "\"If you're a Social Security recipient, you're going to get your check, and that's obviously a good thing,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at the Pacific Research Institute, a think tank focused on free trade, told CBS News.",
      "Which Social Security services could be impacted?",
      "That would depend on how many SSA employees are deemed to be essential, according to the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare.",
      "In a Sept. 24 contingency plan published by the SSA, the agency said about 45,000 employees \u2014 almost 90% of its workforce \u2014 would stay on the job in case of a shutdown. Another roughly 6,200 workers would be furloughed, according to the planning document.",
      "\"We will continue activities critical to our direct-service operations and those needed to ensure accurate and timely payment of benefits,\" the plan states. \"We will cease activities not directly related to the accurate and timely payment of benefits or not critical to our direct-service operations.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 09:12:41 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin on Wednesday, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap. Federal agencies develop plans ahead of a shutdown to determine which employees will remain working.",
      "For instance, the Department of Health and Human Services posted its shutdown plan on Sept. 25, which states that more than 32,000 employees, or about 41% of the agency's workforce, will be furloughed. The other employees are either funded through sources other than annual appropriations or will continue to work, although without pay, because they are in essential roles.",
      "And while federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "Government shutdowns have typically been short, with the pay of military service persons often seen as a deadline for getting funding restored, Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report. The next military pay date at risk from a shutdown would be Oct. 15, they noted.",
      "\"For civilian employees, the first pay date at risk would be Oct. 10 but this is less likely to drive a compromise,\" the analysts noted.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a self-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

The RIF notices would come in addition to any furlough notices directing federal workers to stay home from work without pay if Congress fails to extend government funding by the deadline.",
      "Democrats in Congress framed the move as an intimidation tactic by the White House and OMB Director Russ Vought, and said they intend to barrel ahead with their push to secure wins on key health care priorities in exchange for keeping the government funded.",

      "Democrats have repeatedly pushed for negotiations in the funding fight, looking to extract a more favorable outcome using one of their only points of leverage with Republican majorities in the House and Senate. Earlier this month, Democrats introduced a counteroffer to a GOP-led bill to keep the government funded that would also extend expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The House approved a Republican measure to extend funding for seven weeks. Both the GOP bill and the Democrats' proposal fell short in the Senate, leading to the current stalemate.",
      "After the House approved its bill, GOP leaders extended the lower chamber's break past the Oct. 1 deadline to fund the government, putting pressure on the Senate to approve their proposal. But Jeffries said on Thursday that the House-passed continuing resolution is \"dead on arrival\" in the Senate. He said it's \"unclear\" to him why House Republicans have left D.C. and have \"decided they don't even want to have a conversation with Democrats to reach a bipartisan agreement.\"",

    "story": [
      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",

      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material \u2014 except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",
      "The explosive chemicals are highly toxic, but the animals appeared to have found a way to live near it.",
      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",
      "Hard surfaces on the seafloor are important for marine life that want more than mud and sand.",
      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",
      "The scientists also plan to return to the spot next month to set up a time-lapse camera to watch what the starfishes do next.",
      "Marine life also thriving in shipwrecks",
      "It's the latest example of wildlife flourishing in polluted sites. Previous research has shown shipwrecks and former weapons complexes teeming with biodiversity.",
      "Studies like these are a testament to how nature takes advantage of human leftovers, flipping the script to survive, said marine conservation biologist David Johnston with Duke University. He recently mapped sunken World War I ships that have become habitats for wildlife along the Potomac River in Maryland.",
      "\"I think it's a really cool testimony to the strength of life,\" Johnston told The Associated Press.",
      "A 2023 paper\u00a0published in BioScience\u00a0found that shipwrecks provide important ecological resources for a wide variety of organisms, from tiny microbes to large marine creatures.",

Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions.",

      "The announcement comes just days after the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) launched a probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbot companions on children and teens. OpenAI said that it's prioritizing \"making ChatGPT helpful and safe for everyone, and we know safety matters above all else when young people are involved.",
      "Before the FTC probe, OpenAI indicated that it would introduce\u00a0extra safety protections\u00a0for vulnerable users and teens, after the parents of 16-year-old Adam Raine of California, who died by suicide in April, sued the company late last month. Raine's family allege that ChatGPT led their teen to commit suicide.",
      "It's unclear how OpenAI plans to indentify users' ages, however, it stated that if ChatGPT is unsure about someone's age, or has incomplete information, it will default to the under-18 version.",

      "Other tech companies have taken similar steps to shield teen users from inappropriate content. YouTube, for example, announced a new age-estimation technology that will track the types of videos users watch and how long they've had their account to verify if they are under the age of 18.",
      "According\u00a0to an April Pew Research Center report, parents are generally more worried about the mental health of teenagers than are teens themselves. Among those parents who are at least somewhat concerned about teen mental health, 44% said social media had the biggest negative impact on adolescents.",

      "Philip Intallura, HSBC's group head of quantum technologies, called the trial a \"ground-breaking world-first.\" He expanded on the technology in a company video included in the announcement, saying the improvement in trade predictions ultimately means \"increased margins and greater liquidity.\"",

About two thirds of all trades were conducted using computers by 2009, Deutsche Bank research\u00a0shows.",

      "The Guardian report, published in August in conjunction with Israeli outlets +972 Magazine and Local Call, claimed Israel's military surveillance agency \u2014 called Unit 8200 \u2014 used Microsoft's Azure cloud platform to store recordings of millions of cellphone calls made by Palestinians.",
      "These calls could be played back by intelligence officers, and The Guardian cited three sources within Unit 8200 who said the database was used to help shape military operations in Gaza and the West Bank, and to prepare deadly airstrikes by helping with research and to identify bombing targets in Gaza.",

      "Other sources told The Guardian that use of the data was initially focused on the West Bank, which Israel's military controls.",
      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",

      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",

    "summary": "Investigators remained on scene Monday in Grand Blanc Township, where a shooting and fire at a church left multiple people dead.",
    "story": [
      "Everyone is now accounted for in the aftermath of a shooting and fire at a Michigan church during Sunday services, authorities said during a press conference Monday. The FBI is investigating the Grand Blanc Township melee as \"an act of targeted violence.\"",
      "About 100 people were inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on McClandlish Road around 10:25 a.m. Sunday\u00a0when the shooting happened.",
      "The suspect, identified as a 40-year-old\u00a0Thomas Jacob Sanford of Burton, Michigan, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church, exited his vehicle and fired \"several rounds\" of an assault rifle at hundreds of churchgoers, Grand Blanc Township Police Chief William Renye said.",
      "\"This was an evil act of violence. That's exactly what this was,\" Renye said.",
      "Four victims were killed in the shootings. The shooter is also dead, officials said. Two victims remain in critical condition at an area hospital, and six others were reported to be in stable condition, according to hospital officials. Henry Ford Genesys Hospital said it provided care for some of the victims.",
      "The victims range in age from 6 to 78 years old. Henry Ford officials say that of the eight victims, five were treated for gunshot wounds and three were treated for smoke inhalation.",
      "Monday's press conference was the final in a series of in-person reports, with local police saying additional updates will come from their social media. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was among those who spoke Monday, alongside FBI Detroit acting special agent in charge Reuben C. Coleman, Genesee County Sheriff Christopher R. Swanson, ATF special agent in charge of the Detroit Field Office James Deir and Michigan State Police Director Col. James F. Grady II.",
      "Deir asked that area residents avoid the area near the church, which has been blocked off, asking for cooperation from the public as investigators continue to comb through the wreckage left by the fire. Over 100 victims and witnesses have been interviewed so far, Coleman said. Numerous special teams from state and federal agencies are working on the case, including a National Response Team from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "In the meantime, the authorities praised the dedication of first responders and law enforcement at the scene, some of whom had only two months experience on the job, along with the immediate response of the church attendees during the incident.",
      "\"There are noble heroes who do not wear a uniform that went to that church yesterday .... Those heroes from that church did their job,\" the sheriff said.",
      "Survivor Paul Kirby told \"CBS Mornings\" it was \"the scariest moment of my life, not knowing if my family was OK.\" Kirby's wife and children were with him, attending a service at the church, when they heard \"a loud boom coming from the back wall of the chapel.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said investigators were looking into how much planning went into the attack and whether any clues about the motive were left behind.",
      "\"From what I understand, based on my conversations with the FBI director, all they know right now is this was an individual who hated people of the Mormon faith,\" she said Monday.",
      "The shooting occurred a day after Russell M. Nelson, the oldest-ever president of the Utah-based faith, died at 101.",
      "Sanford was an Iraq war veteran who deployed once for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided to CBS News by the Pentagon. Sanford served in the Marines for four years.",
      "Crews in white coveralls and hard hats searched through what remained of the church on Monday morning. A silver pickup truck with two American flags in the back remained where it had smashed into the front brick wall near a sign that says \"visitors welcome.\"",
      "U.S. officials and state lawmakers shared messages in response to the shooting, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer ordered U.S. and Michigan flags to be lowered to half-staff through Friday to honor and remember the victims.",
      "Grand Blanc Community Schools were closed on Monday.",
      "Bloomfield Township Police says it will \"increase patrols around our places of worship and other community gatherings to help ensure a safe environment for everyone.\"",
      "The shooting was the latest of several attacks on houses of worship in the U.S. over the past 20 years, including one in August that killed two children at the Church of the Annunciation in Minneapolis.",
      "The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the investigation, has asked anyone with information to call 1-800-225-5324 or submit a tip\u00a0here.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Senate returns to Washington on Monday with less than two days to fund the government amid a stalemate between Democrats and Republicans on the path forward that has increased the likelihood of a government shutdown this week.",
      "Lawmakers were away on recess last week after the House approved a GOP-led continuing resolution to keep the government funded until Nov. 21. But the measure fell short in the Senate, as Democrats pushed a counter-proposal that would keep the government funded through October, while attaching a handful of their priorities. That measure also failed to secure the necessary support for passage.",
      "Republicans have 53 seats in the Senate, a majority. But with 60 votes needed to advance most legislation in the upper chamber, Republicans can't approve a bill to fund the government without the help of Democrats.",
      "With few opportunities to exert influence with a GOP-controlled House, Senate and White House, Democrats have been pushing to extract a more favorable outcome in the spending fight, facing pressure from their base to push back on the Trump administration's policies. But the posture has proven complicated for the party that has repeatedly supported efforts to keep the government funded.",
      "Democrats push for negotiations",
      "Both parties have pushed for a stopgap measure to keep the government funded while work on full-year appropriations bills continues, but Democrats have advocated for weeks for taking the funding effort to the negotiating table, introducing a counter-proposal earlier this month that appeared to serve as an opening salvo.",
      "While the Republican-led continuing resolution would fund the government until Nov. 21, the Democrats' proposal includes one of their key priorities \u2014 extending expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "The proposal, which would extend government funding until Oct. 31 and boost security funding, includes a permanent extension of enhanced tax credits for Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, which Democrats have suggested is a red line for their support. The subsidies, which were originally passed in 2021, are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Also in their proposed measure to fund the government, Democrats included language to roll back Medicaid restrictions in President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" and restore funding for public broadcasters that was rescinded earlier this year.",
      "Democratic leaders have been pushing for a meeting with Mr. Trump on government funding. And the leaders are set to meet Monday with the president, alongside Senate Majority Leader John Thune and House Speaker Mike Johnson after the president canceled an initial meeting last week, citing the Democrats' \"unserious and ridiculous\" demands.",
      "Then, the Trump administration upped the ante last week, when the White House's Office of Management and Budget sent a memo to federal agencies Wednesday telling them to consider reduction-in-force notices, or layoffs, for employees in programs, projects or activities that received discretionary funding.",
      "Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday that he called Thune Friday and urged him to get the leaders together for a meeting. The next day, he said the White House told them the meeting was on for Monday afternoon.",
      "The New York Democrat called the meeting a \"first step,\" saying \"we need a serious negotiation.\"",
      "\"I think they felt the heat, and they now want to sit down,\" Schumer said. \"But the fundamental question hasn't been answered yet, and we'll see on Monday: are they serious about negotiating with us in a real way?\"",
      "But Mr. Trump said Sunday that a government shutdown is likely unless top Democrats back down from their negotiating position, telling CBS News \"I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue.\"",
      "The shutdown blame game",
      "Democrats and Republicans have preempted the possible shutdown in recent days, seeking to put the blame on the other party should Congress fail to fund the government \u2014 forcing federal agencies to halt non-essential functions.",
      "With Republicans in the majority, Democrats have argued that they should bear responsibility for keeping the government open, and should be willing to negotiate to do so. But Republicans have insisted that there's no need, since Democrats regularly support \"clean\" continuing resolutions to keep the government funded.",
      "Thune told NBC that Democrats are using a seven-week funding resolution, designed to give lawmakers more time to work on the appropriations process, to \"try and get a whole laundry list of things that they want,\" accusing them of taking \"the federal government as a hostage.\" He added that he doesn't know \"what we're supposed to be negotiating.\"",
      "\"This is a simple, straightforward deal to keep the government running,\" the South Dakota Republican said, urging that Democrats should help keep the government funded, and then have a conversation about extending the health care subsidies.",
      "While Democrats have put the blame on Mr. Trump for a possible shutdown, Republicans have argued that any failure to fund the government will be Schumer's doing.",
      "Schumer has faced intense pressure from his party to stand up to the Trump administration and its policies in the spending fight, after he allowed Republicans to move ahead with their spending bill during the last funding dispute.",
      "After pledging to fight the GOP funding plan in March, Schumer changed course at the eleventh hour and delivered one of the Democratic votes necessary to propel the partisan measure to passage and prevent a shutdown. Schumer argued at the time that a shutdown risked more damage, despite intense criticism from some within his own party.",
      "But that was before Republicans in Congress approved their \"big, beautiful bill,\" which included restrictions to Medicaid that Democrats vehemently opposed, along with a rescissions package clawing back more than $9 billion in congressionally appropriated funds for foreign aid and public broadcasting.

      "Thomas Jacob \"Jake\" Sanford, 40, drove his vehicle through the front doors of the church and fired multiple rounds from an assault rifle during Sunday services, authorities said. Sanford also apparently used gas to start a fire at the church, officials said. Grand Blanc police chief William Renye  said officers were on the scene within 30 seconds after a 911 call and fatally shot Sanford, who killed four people and injured eight more.",
      "Sanford served in the U.S. Marines from 2004 to 2008, CBS News confirmed. He was an Iraq war veteran who deployed for several months during 2007 and 2008, according to service records provided by the Pentagon.",

      "Kris Johns, who is running for city council in Burton, Michigan, which is near where the shooting happened in Grand Blanc Township, told CBS News he met Sanford at his home last week while campaigning. He said Sanford had a particular dislike of the Latter-day Saints church, which was previously known as the Mormon church.

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 19:47:47 -0400",
    "summary": "The possibility of a shutdown raises questions about what it would mean for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Hundreds of thousands of federal employees could soon go without pay or face potential layoffs if Congress remains at an impasse over government funding, with a shutdown set to begin Oct. 1.",
      "The GOP-controlled House passed a bill earlier this month to extend government funding until Nov. 21, but the bill has stalled in the Senate, where Democratic votes are needed to advance it. Democrats want an extension of health care subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, which Republicans have opposed. Without a resolution, the government will begin to shut down on Wednesday.",
      "If funding lapses, federal employees in critical positions would be required to stay on the job. Many others would be forced to stay home. Both groups would have their paychecks delayed until Congress approves more spending. Most federal contractors might not get paid at all.",
      "Here's what the shutdown threat means for lawmakers themselves \u2014 and their paychecks.",
      "Will members of Congress get paid if there's a government shutdown?",
      "The short answer is yes. Lawmakers will continue to draw a paycheck even if they haven't reached a deal to fund the government.",
      "The reason is because of how their pay is treated under the Constitution and federal law. Article I, Section 6 of the Constitution states: \"The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States.\" This means they must get paid whether or not other parts of the government are funded.",
      "Pursuant to that section, members' pay rate is set by a process established by federal law, and the 27th Amendment says any law to change their pay can't take effect until after the next congressional election. Lawmakers' pay has been funded by a permanent appropriation since 1983, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report, meaning funding for their pay doesn't need to be renewed annually.",
      "Most members earn a salary of $174,000 per year, a rate that has not changed since 2009. The speaker of the House earns $223,500, while the president pro tempore of the Senate and the party leaders in both chambers make $193,400.",
      "When it comes to other federal entities, the law that governs how they must act during a lapse in funding is known as the Antideficiency Act. In short, it says that federal agencies generally can't spend more money than Congress has approved. This means many agencies must furlough employees \u2014 that is, tell them to stay home \u2014 if they haven't received funding.",
      "There are some exceptions. Some programs, like Social Security and Medicare, have permanent funding, and benefits continue to be paid out as normal. Employees whose jobs are necessary to protect life and property must also stay on the job. Those whose roles are authorized by other laws can keep working, as can officials with constitutional responsibilities.",
      "When it comes to congressional staffers, each office determines which employees are deemed essential and thus allowed to keep working during a shutdown. Most are expected to keep all or nearly all of their employees on board, though the staffers won't be paid until more funding is approved.",
      "Does the president get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Yes. The Constitution prohibits reducing the president's salary while in office, \"thus effectively guaranteeing the president of compensation regardless of any shutdown action,\" according to a Congressional Research Service report from 2018.",
      "The president earns $400,000 annually, an amount set by Congress in 2001.",
      "His aides and staffers, however, are subject to the furlough requirements under the Antideficiency Act, meaning those in nonessential positions could be told to stay home until Congress authorizes more funding. In past shutdowns, presidents have furloughed many executive branch employees to increase pressure on Congress to take action.",
      "Do other federal employees get paid during a shutdown?",
      "Federal employees, whether they remain on the job or are furloughed, won't get paid while the government is shut down.",
      "They also face the risk of being permanently laid off if there's a shutdown, according to a memo from the Office of Budget and Management. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Those who still have jobs will receive back pay once funding is restored to their agency. In prior shutdowns, Congress had to approve back pay for employees, but a 2019 law made it mandatory. Contractors \u2014 who were responsible for carrying out about $755 billion worth of government work in the last fiscal year \u2014 are not guaranteed back pay.",
      "Each agency determines which positions are considered essential and which are not. The Office of Management and Budget has directed agencies to notify employees no later than two business days before a lapse in funding about their work and pay status.",
      "Some members of Congress have previously pointed out the apparent hypocrisy of lawmakers continuing to be paid while other federal employees miss out on their checks. In 2023, members of both parties offered different proposals that would prevent Congress from getting paid during shutdowns, but none attracted widespread support, and the 27th Amendment forbids any immediate change.",

      "Active-duty service members won't get paid on time unless Congress passes a separate piece of legislation, as it did in 2013 with the \"Pay Our Military Act,\" which ensured military pay and allowances continued during a government shutdown.",
      "Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia introduced a bill earlier this month with bipartisan support, the \"Pay Our Troops Act of 2026,\" which would keep members of the military and Coast Guard paid during a shutdown, but it's unlikely to pass in time because the House is out of session until Oct 7.",
      "During the last shutdown in 2019, the Navy Federal Credit Union and USAA offered special loans to members of the military, and they plan to do so again if there's a shutdown in October. The Navy Federal Credit Union said in a\u00a0press release\u00a0it would \"offer 0% APR loans to eligible members whose pay may be affected, continuing a tradition of assistance seen during previous shutdowns in 2011, 2013 and 2018-2019, when nearly 20,000 members received support.\" USAA plans to offer eligible members who have accounts with the bank a \"no-interest loan equal to the amount of one net paycheck.\"",

The list includes, in order: operations to secure the U.S. Southern Border, Middle East operations, the U.S. missile defense project Golden Dome for America, depot maintenance, shipbuilding and critical munitions.",
      "The guidance estimates about 406,000 of the department's 741,000 civilian employees will be required to work in the event of a shutdown because their mission is critical and not easily carried out by any U.S. service member.",
      "While a memo from the White House Office of Management and Budget said some civilians could be laid off during the shutdown, the guidance released by the Defense Department outlines furloughs but no cuts to the civilian workforce.",
      "During the shutdown, medical care and dental care would be excepted, according to the contingency guidance, but elective surgeries and other elective procedures would be delayed unless they're necessary for military readiness. Private health care using the Defense Department's TRICARE medical insurance would continue uninterrupted.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Much of the federal government is on the verge of shutting down if Congress does not reach a deal to approve new funding by Wednesday, Oct. 1, 2025.",
      "Republicans have proposed extending government funding at current levels until Nov. 21 to allow for members to continue working on full-year appropriations bills. Democrats made a counteroffer to keep the government open through October, but attached health care provisions and restrictions on President Trump's ability to withhold funding, both of which are nonstarters with most Republicans.",
      "The two sides are dug in on their positions, increasing the chances of a shutdown beginning Wednesday. Congressional leaders met with President Trump at the White House on Monday to search for a path forward, but walked away in the same position.",
      "A government shutdown occurs when Congress fails to pass funding for some or all agencies, which can't spend money that hasn't been approved by lawmakers. There have been 14 shutdowns since 1980, with the most recent coming in 2018. That shutdown lasted 34 days.",
      "Here's what to know about what happens during a government shutdown:",
      "What is a government shutdown?",
      "Most federal government agencies are funded annually by a dozen appropriations bills that need to be passed by Congress and signed by the president before the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1. These are often grouped together into one large piece of legislation known as an \"omnibus\" bill to speed up the process when Congress inevitably needs to pass a number of them at the last minute.",
      "If the funding deadline passes without Congress authorizing more spending, the government must fully or partially shut down, depending on which agencies are already funded. Ahead of this year's deadline, none of the 12 appropriations bills have been enacted. Some agencies got an infusion of money in the Republican-passed \"one big, beautiful bill\" earlier this year, meaning certain programs and functions in some departments will remain funded in the event of a shutdown, chiefly the Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "Lawmakers regularly buy themselves more time to finish spending bills by passing what's known as a continuing resolution, which temporarily extends current funding levels to keep agencies functioning while they work to reach an agreement on new spending.",
      "The Constitution says the Treasury Department cannot spend money without a law authorizing it. Under a statute known as the Antideficiency Act, agencies are required to cease operations \u2014 with certain exceptions \u2014 in the absence of funding authorized by Congress. The act, a version of which first passed in 1870, with several significant updates since, also prohibits the government from entering into financial obligations without congressional sign-off.",
      "\"Treasury cannot pay out any money if there's not a law providing for who gets the money,\" said Matt Glassman, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University. \"If those annual bills expire, then there is no law appropriating money for certain functions.\"",
      "What happens during a government shutdown, and who is affected?",
      "In a shutdown, the federal government must stop all non-essential functions until funding is approved by Congress and signed into law, except for programs that are funded by other means, like fees or other legislation. Each agency determines what work is essential and what is not. Members of Congress make that determination for their own staff, as well.",
      "\"No money can come out of Treasury whether you're essential or not essential. But who can keep working and incur obligations, even when there are no appropriations \u2014 there are three exceptions,\" Glassman said.",
      "Those exceptions are defined by the Antideficiency Act. They allow the government to fund operations to protect life and property, and keep officials involved in the constitutional process on the job, like the president, his staff and members of Congress.",
      "All active-duty military members, many federal law enforcement officers and employees at federally funded hospitals are considered essential, along with air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration officers. Each agency determines which of its employees can stay on the job.",
      "In a step that differs from previous shutdowns, the Office of Budget and Management last week told federal agencies to consider permanent mass layoffs for programs or projects that have discretionary funding that runs out on Oct. 1 or that don't have any alternative sources of funding. The reduction-in-force notices would be in addition to any furlough notices issued during a shutdown, according to a memo sent to the agencies.",
      "\"Programs that did not benefit from an infusion of mandatory appropriations will bear the brunt of a shutdown, and we must continue our planning efforts in the event Democrats decide to shut down the government,\" the memo said.",
      "Whether employees are essential or not, if their pay is dependent on annual appropriations, they won't get paid during a shutdown.",
      "Essential employees continue to work during the shutdown, but don't get paid until funding is restored to their agency. Employees in nonessential positions are typically furloughed until the government is funded again, although that could look different this time if there are widespread layoffs. Under a 2019 law, furloughed employees are guaranteed to receive back pay once the shutdown is over.",
      "A Senate report published in 2019 found that government shutdowns in 2013, 2018 and 2019 cost taxpayers nearly $4 billion, including at least $3.7 billion in back pay to furloughed workers who were not permitted to work.",
      "What is open and closed during a shutdown?",
      "Entitlement programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid continue to function during a shutdown because benefit payments are funded through permanent appropriations that don't require renewal. Entitlement payments keep going out, but the working budgets of the agencies that oversee the programs require approval by Congress. That means staff could be furloughed, causing delays in enrolling new beneficiaries or other service interruptions.",
      "\"Any type of interaction you're having at a customer service level with the federal government could definitely be affected,\" Glassman said.",
      "For example, travel plans could be disrupted if air traffic control and airport security, who are essential workers, do not show up to work in protest for not being paid immediately. Many national parks stayed open during the last shutdown in 2018 and 2019, but understaffing led to vandalism and cuts in visitor services. The parks largely closed during the 2013 shutdown. The U.S. Postal Service continues to operate, since it is self-funded.",
      "Maya MacGuineas, the president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the public may not notice the effects if the shutdown is short-lived.",
      "\"The truth is, most people won't really feel much of a difference,\" MacGuineas said. \"If you've got a vacation planned to a National Park, you're going to be [upset] and disappointed. But most people will go on with their everyday lives and interact with the government the same way they do and not feel a big difference. That could get worse, the longer it lasts.\"",
      "The Senate report found the 2018-2019 shutdown had widespread impacts across a variety of government functions that ceased or were curtailed during the lapse in funding. It noted that furloughs in many agencies like the SEC, Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Product Safety Commission hampered enforcement and investigations. The report said the Justice Department canceled 60,000 immigration hearings.",
      "The effects could be even more pronounced this time around, given the possibility that the administration could use the shutdown to implement mass layoffs, furthering the president's aim of permanently reducing the federal workforce.",
      "When was the last government shutdown?",
      "The last government shutdown stretched from December 2018 until January 2019, when congressional funding for nine executive branch departments with roughly 800,000 employees lapsed.",
      "The five-week partial shutdown cost the economy $11 billion, according to a Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO said most of that would be recovered once the shutdown ended, but estimated a permanent loss of about $3 billion.",
      "Businesses across the country that relied on government customers reported a slowdown in business and some said they had to lay off employees. Tens of thousands of immigration court hearings were canceled. Government contractors struggled to feed their families and pay their bills.",
      "The shutdown stemmed from a standoff over Mr. Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the border with Mexico. Mr. Trump had vowed to close the government if the funding wasn't included in spending legislation, but Democrats refused to give in.",
      "Mr. Trump conceded after insisting for weeks that he would not reopen the government without money for the wall, signing a bill to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated a spending deal.",
      "Three weeks later, Mr. Trump signed a compromise spending bill to avert another government shutdown, ultimately accepting a bill that did not meet his $5.7 billion demand for his long-promised border wall.",
      "When was the longest government shutdown?",
      "Before the early 1980s, the government would typically continue operating as usual even when funding bills hadn't been passed, but that changed after the attorney general issued opinions stating that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional approval.",
      "Since 1980, there have been 14 shutdowns, most of which lasted just a few days.",
      "The longest shutdown in U.S. history was the 2018-2019 lapse, which lasted 34 full days. Before that, the record was 21 days in 1995 and 1996, when President Bill Clinton held out against steep spending and tax cuts favored by Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich.",

      "OpenAI, the company that developed ChatGPT,\u00a0announced\u00a0new parental controls on Monday aimed at helping protect young people who interact with its generative artificial intelligence program.",
      "All ChatGPT users will have access to the control features from Monday onward, the company said.",
      "The announcement comes as OpenAI, which technically allows users as young as 13 to sign up, contends with mounting public pressure to prioritize the safety of ChatGPT for teenagers. (OpenAI says on its website that it requires users ages 13 to 18 to obtain parental consent before using ChatGPT.)",
      "In August, the California-based technology company pledged to implement changes to its flagship product after facing\u00a0a wrongful death lawsuit\u00a0by parents of a 16-year-old who alleged the chatbot led their son to take his own life.",
      "OpenAI's new controls will allow parents to link their own ChatGPT accounts to the accounts of their teenagers \"and customize settings for a safe, age-appropriate experience,\" OpenAI said in Monday's announcement. Certain types of content are then automatically restricted on a teenager's linked account, including graphic content, viral challenges, \"sexual, romantic or violent\" role-play, and \"extreme beauty ideals,\" according to the company.",
      "Along with content moderation, parents can opt to receive a notification from OpenAI should their child exhibit potential signs of harming themselves while interacting with ChatGPT.",
      "\"If our systems detect potential harm, a small team of specially trained people reviews the situation,\" the company said. \"If there are signs of acute distress, we will contact parents by email, text message and push alert on their phone, unless they have opted out.\"",
      "The company also said it is \"working on the right process and circumstances in which to reach law enforcement or other emergency services\" in emergencies where a teen may be in imminent danger and a parent cannot be reached.",
      "\"We know some teens turn to ChatGPT during hard moments, so we've built a new notification system to help parents know if something may be seriously wrong,\" OpenAI said.",
      "OpenAI has introduced other measures recently aimed at helping safeguard younger ChatGPT users. The company said earlier this month that chatbot users identified as being under 18 will automatically be directed to a version that is governed by \"age-appropriate\" content rules.",
      "\"The way ChatGPT responds to a 15-year-old should look different than the way it responds to an adult,\" the company said at the time.",
      "It noted on Monday, however, that while guardrails help, \"they're not foolproof and can be bypassed if someone is intentionally trying to get around them.\"",
      "People can use ChatGPT without creating an account, and parental controls and automatic content limits only work if users are signed in.",
      "\"We will continue to thoughtfully iterate and improve over time,\" the company said. \"We recommend parents talk with their teens about healthy AI use and what that looks like for their family.\"",
      "The Federal Trade Commission has started an inquiry into several social media and artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI, about the potential harms to teens and children who use their chatbots as companions.",

    "summary": "A prolonged government shutdown, as occurred in 2018, could lead to long lines at TSA checkpoints and economic losses, experts warn.",
    "story": [
      "Although a short U.S.\u00a0government shutdown would be unlikely to have much impact on air travel, a prolonged impasse could lead to disruptions for passengers and financial losses for businesses, according to travel experts and industry groups.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration and Transportation Security Administration define most of their employees as essential, requiring them to work even if the government closes and workers at other federal agencies are furloughed. That means airport screeners, air traffic controllers, federal air marshals, safety inspectors and other workers with the two agencies would be expected to continue showing up on the job \u2014 without pay \u2014 even if lawmakers fail this week to strike a deal on federal funding.",
      "But things could get messy if a shutdown dragged on and government employees suddenly deprived of a paycheck come under financial pressure, Caleb Harmon-Marshall, a former TSA officer, told CBS News.",
      "\"TSA officers are expected to continue to report to work. But in the past, if a shutdown exceeds two weeks, officers start to get frantic, and they stop going to work,\" he said, adding that agency personnel may call in sick and even seek other job opportunities if a shutdown persists.",
      "Any ensuing labor shortages can lead to snarled lines at airport security. For example, roughly 10% of TSA workers called in sick during the 34-day government shutdown that started in December 2018 and extended into 2019, driving up screening times at major airports across the country.",
      "\"So if officers decide not to come to work, there is less personnel manning checkpoints, and wait times can potentially get longer,\" Harmon-Marshall said.",
      "Barring a deal in Congress, a shutdown would begin at 12:01 a.m. on Wednesday, Oct. 1. If lawmakers passed a spending bill, TSA and FAA workers would be entitled to back pay for any time worked during a shutdown.",
      "$1 billion hit",
      "The U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, warned that a government shutdown could cost the economy $1 billion a week, while also inconveniencing passengers and hurting travel industry businesses.",
      "\"A shutdown exacerbates staffing shortages among Transportation Security Administration officers and air traffic controllers, threatening longer airport security lines, flight delays and cancellations,\" the group said in a Sept. 25 letter. \"It halts hiring and training of new air traffic controllers when we are already short more than 2,800 controllers nationwide, and restarting the process adds further delays even after funding is restored.\"",
      "The U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of air traffic controllers, and has launched an effort to hire more than 2,000 additional controllers by the end of the fiscal year.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Transportation Department responded to requests for comment about the impact of a potential government shutdown on travel in the U.S.",
      "By contrast, train travel is unlikely to be disrupted if the government closes this week, according to the Rail Passengers Association, which represents the nation's rail travelers. Although Amtrak receives some federal funding and could eventually be impacted if a shutdown dragged on, the rail service is financially healthy enough to pay workers in the near term and keep trains in operation, the group\u00a0said in a statement last week.",

    "published": "Mon, 29 Sep 2025 11:46:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Eli Sharabi, who was taken hostage by Hamas terrorists on October 7, 2023, before being released last February, explains why he remains optimistic for the future.",
    "story": [
      "\"You know, 50 meters underground, you actually understand the meaning in life,\" said Eli Sharabi. For 491 days, Sharabi was a Hamas hostage. \"That it's not your academic degrees and not your profession,\" he said. \"You miss your family and friends, and just wish for another minute with them.\"",
      "Held captive deep in tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi always imagined returning to his home in the Israeli Kibbutz Be'eri. \"Sunday Morning\" was with him earlier this month when he returned for the first time since his release. Time has seemingly stopped in this community just three miles from Gaza. Two years on, the shrubbery has grown up around his house. But there's no concealing the pain here.",
      "\"Wow,\" Sharabi said, getting emotional. \"I remember they grabbed me from here.\"",
      "His wife, Lianne, and their daughters, 16-year-old Noiya and 13-year-old Yahel, were still inside, as Hamas terrorists overran their kibbutz, killing 101 of its residents.",
      "He said, \"This place used to help so much to Palestinian civilians \u2013 send them money and take some of them from the border to hospitals in Israel.\" Those memories are hard to reconcile with his last moments here.",
      "He says he knew he was being kidnapped: \"I understood Arabic. My last second in the house, I just turned my head and like that to my daughters and said, 'I'll come back.'\"",
      "It's a nightmare he details in his book \"Hostage,\" a gripping account of his ordeal, in which he wrote on page one, \"Five terrorists enter with weapons drawn. We are in our pajamas; they come with uniforms, balaclavas, and Kalashnikovs. They found us.\"",
      "\"I will never forget the fears in my daughter's eyes,\" he said. \"It was horrible.\"",
      "In that horrible chaos of the day when 250 others were taken hostage, Sharabi was ultimately brought into a home and tied up.",
      "\"After 52 days, they moved us to the tunnels,\" he said. \"The first mosque we've seen, we got in, they opened the door on the floor, and we've seen the ladder and they asked us to climb down, something like 30 meters. It looked like the perfect grave.\"",
      "In the tunnels under Gaza, Sharabi was held with various hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was later murdered by Hamas at age 24. Golberg-Polin often repeated a quote which stuck with Sharabi: \"He who has a why to live, can bear any how.\"",
      "\"You're looking for any source that give you hope, that give you strength,\" Sharabi said.",
      "His captors told him his wife and daughters were alive, seen at protests campaigning for his release. It was the \"why\" he needed to cope with that torture in the tunnels.",
      "\"They beat us,\" Sharabi said. \"One time they broke my ribs and I couldn't breathe properly for two or three months, and my friend needed to help me to stand to go to the bathroom. They undressed us every two weeks and look for things that maybe we are going to attack them with them.\"",
      "What did that experience do to him? \"It's very humiliating moments for you,\" he said, \"and especially when you are chained to your friends, leg by leg, and you need to go to the bathroom with him \u2026 you have to go together. It's very, very humiliating moment. There's no running water, so you use bottles. You can see the worms everywhere. Worms, rats, cockroaches.\"",
      "When we were in Kibbutz Be'eri in mid-September, explosions could be heard as Israel stepped up its ground offensive in Gaza. \"It's not nice, these explosions,\" Sharabi said. \"Especially when you think it's another 48 hostages remain there. Two years. It's awful for both sides.\"",
      "I asked, \"There are going to be people who watch this and say, 'You're giving this space to this man to share his story. What about the 60,000-plus people in Gaza who've been killed?'\"",
      "\"First of all, they need to remember who started October 7,\" Sharabi replied. \"If someone can explain to me how you fighting against a terror organization that hiding behind his own population without people to get hurt, innocent people, I don't know how to do it.\"",
      "He worries especially about another captive he left behind: 24-year-old Alon Ohel. Sharabi became a father figure to him in their year-plus together, and when Sharabi found out he was going to be freed, Ohel was not on the list. \"You imagine this moment hundreds of times,\" Sharabi said. \"And you believe it's going to be the happiest moment ever. And because of Alon, this moment become very complicated. He had small panic attack. He started to cry and shaking. So, we took water, washed his face, hugging him. It wasn't easy.\"",
      "He says his mission now is to bring all of the hostages home. Sharabi has been fighting to get the remaining living hostages out, along with the bodies of those, like his brother, Yossi, who were killed in captivity.",
      "Sharabi's emotions are often close to the surface, but kept in check, even describing the unimaginable: being shackled. \"We were chained with iron chains on our legs, 24/7,\" he said. \"Every step you make, it's not more than three inches. It was a week before the release when they took it off, and our legs start to fly all over the place. We couldn't control them because we didn't know how to walk.\"",
      "When he was released, he'd lost 66 pounds. The handover was terrifying, he says, but he could endure anything just to hug his wife and daughters again. Then, he heard this from the social worker greeting him in Israel: Your mother and your sister waiting for you.",
      "Sharabi said when he heard that he said, \"'Well, just bring me Lianne and my daughters.' And she said, 'Well, your mother and your sister will tell you.'\"",
      "Lianne, Noiya and Yahel were among the 1,200 people killed on October 7, 2023.",
      "Next to their graves is a place for his brother, Yossi.",
      "Today, Sharabi said, \"I choose life. I need to be strong for them. I don't have the privilege to break. I'm really grateful for my second chance.\"",
      "He says he thinks of his wife and daughters and the life they missed. \"But I'm very positive the life I'm going to rebuild,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"How can you be so positive after losing so much?\"",
      "\"I love life. I love life,\" he replied. \"I'm very proud that I'm that meaningful for other people. It's the most moving feeling that you can feel, that people care about you. People say for me, 'We lose simple things, and we think our world is finished. And you lost your brother, your wife, and your daughters, and you're smiling today. How's that possible?'\"",
      "And his response? \"I can't do anything, anything that bring back Lianne, Noyia, Yahel, Yossi. And so, the best thing I can do for their memories is to be optimistic and to be strong and to rebuild my life.\"",

      "The execution came as Iran vowed to confront what it called its enemies after the United Nations reimposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program this weekend. The European Union followed suit Monday, imposing similar sanctions on Iran.",
      "Iran accused Choobiasl of meeting with operatives from the Israeli spy agency Mossad, calling him the agency's \"most trusted\" spy.

Iran has taken Russia's side in that conflict, giving its military critical support, including armed drones.",

It's something the president's going to make the final determination on,\" Vance said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"",

      "The U.S.-made Tomahawk missile has a range of about 1,500 miles, which would place Moscow well within the range of Kyiv should the Ukrainian government obtain them.",
      "On Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov implied that the U.S. was directly interfering in the war between Russian and Ukraine. \"Moscow has heard Washington's statements about possible Tomahawk deliveries to Ukraine and is carefully analyzing them,\" Peskov said at a news conference. \"It is important to understand who will be directing and launching the Tomahawk missiles from Ukrainian territory \u2014 the Americans or the Ukrainians themselves.\"",

      "Russia fired more than 600 drones and missiles\u00a0at targets across Ukraine in the early hours of Sunday morning, the Ukrainian Air Force\u00a0said in a statement. The attacks killed four people and wounded dozens more, Ukrainian officials said, and was one of the largest aerial barrages Ukraine has faced since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of the country in 2022.",
      "Mr. Trump has grown increasingly frustrated with Russia's failure to come to the table to negotiate a peace deal with Ukraine, and he has offered Ukraine encouragement over the past week in its fight to repel Russian troops.",
      "\"Russia has been fighting aimlessly for three and a half years a War that should have taken a Real Military Power less than a week to win. This is not distinguishing Russia. In fact, it is very much making them look like 'a paper tiger,'\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post Tuesday.",

The Russia-friendly Alternativa Bloc came third, followed by the populist Our Party. The right-wing Democracy at Home party also won enough votes to enter parliament.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to Face The Nation. We have breaking news as we begin what is likely to be another turbulent week here in Washington. Congress faces a government shutdown deadline of October 1. Our Robert Costa spoke this morning to President Trump. Bob, top leaders, both parties, both sides of the Capitol, are coming to the White House. Did the President tell you he thinks a shutdown can be avoided?",
      "ROBERT COSTA: A shutdown looks likely at this point based on my conversation this morning with President Trump. He says both sides are at a stalemate. Democrats want to extend health care subsidies that were part of the Affordable Care Act, but President Trump said his focus on health care is on preventing undocumented migrants from having access to any of the U.S. health care system. Now, it's illegal for any non-citizen to have that sort of access, but President Trump says we're not going to have it. Quote, we're not going to allow it, in terms of moving forward on any discussion, unless the Democrats come to his side on health care and don't focus on the subsidies. But based on my conversations with top Democrats, that's not going to happen. So President Trump told me quote, I just don't know how we are going to solve this issue. That makes a shutdown quite likely. And inside the White House, sources are saying President Trump actually welcomes a shutdown in the sense that he believes he can wield executive power to get rid of what he calls waste, fraud and abuse. And there is that memo, as you mentioned, that says the government is ready to have mass firings if a deal isn't struck.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Reductions in force, right. Well, we also know that the President took some extraordinary public statements in the past few days. He publicly said he wants to see Adam Schiff, now a senator, Letitia James prosecuted along with James Comey, the former FBI director who is now indicted. Yesterday, he twice posted on social media about former FBI Director Chris Wray. Did the President tell you, is he planning prosecutions?",
      "COSTA: I did not speak directly to the president about that today. But fishing around all weekend in his inner circle, it's clear, this is just the beginning in terms of possible prosecutions of those who have scrutinized the president or criticized him over the years. You mentioned the mortgage policy, potentially, of Senator Adam Schiff of California. He's being discussed inside of the Trump administration. So is Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, who sued the president over how he valued his real estate holdings. And there are others not even on our radar at this moment, like retired Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Milley, who are being discussed as people who have, may have taken action against the administration or president in some way, allegedly, in the views of those inside. And they want to see the Justice Department hold them to account. There's such a gap right now in Washington. Republicans believe what President Trump is doing is accountability. Democrats are alarmed and see this as authoritarian government at work. And there's a real tension there that's not going away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No. And a justice system that has to deal with evidence and facts.",
      "And we're going to talk about all of this ahead with some of our guests. Robert Costa, thank you very much for your reporting."

      "Another two Americans were released from Afghanistan in March. Faye Hall, who had been detained earlier in the year on charges of using an unauthorized drone, was arrested with a British couple who remained in Taliban custody, sources told CBS News after Hall's release. The British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, were freed earlier this month. Separately, American\u00a0George Glezmann was also freed in March after being detained during a tourist visit to Afghanistan in 2022, in a move that the former U.S. envoy to Afghanistan called \"a goodwill gesture\" to President Trump by the Taliban.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Ty Cobb, who served as White House Special Counsel during President Trump's first term, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ty Cobb. He served as White House Special Counsel for just under a year during the first Trump administration, helping to coordinate the response to Robert Mueller's probe of Russian influence on the 2016 election. Good morning to you.",
      "FORMER WHITE HOUSE SPECIAL COUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT TY COBB: Good morning, Margaret. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we saw this action against former FBI Director James Comey this past week, and he was indicted on two charges specific to his September 2020 testimony to Congress about Russian election meddling in 2016, so-called Crossfire Hurricane. In your view, from what you've heard of this case, do you think it has enough substance to actually head to trial?",
      "COBB: I don't, really. You know, as you and Senator Kaine discussed briefly, moments ago, that the grand jury rejected one of the counts, the top count, actually, in the indictment, approved two, but by a very slim margin, 14 out of 23 in a process where there's no defense attorney in the room, and the standard is merely probable cause. The next courtroom that this will be assessed in, if it gets to trial, requires unanimity from 12 people, and there will be a vigorous defense. I don't see any way in the world that, you know, Comey will be convicted. And I think there's a good chance, because of, you know, the wholly unconstitutional, authoritarian way that this was done, that the case may get tossed out well before trial.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Wholly unconstitutional and authoritarian. That's- that's quite a description. You used to work for President Trump. What makes you now characterized his actions that way?",
      "COBB: I used to work- well, I used to work at the White House as as a lawyer, you know, interacting with the Justice Department in the Mueller investigation and other matters, and I was not Trump's personal lawyer. So, my role was really, you know, as a- as a government employee, and not personal to the- to the president. He did have personal lawyers, but, you know, at the time, you know, I was trying to perform the duties that were assigned to me. In this- in this circumstance, you know, I'm eight years removed from that. I don't- I don't have any allegiances or reasons to, you know, say anything other than balls and strikes. And former Attorney General Jackson, Justice Jackson, Nuremberg Prosecutor, himself, highlighted in 1940 that the most important thing at the Justice Department when he was Attorney General was that people not target individuals, that they merely pursue crimes. Griffin Bell, years later, 1978 said essentially the same thing. Emphasized how political- politics and favor have no business at the Justice Department. It's all about even-handedness. And I think we talked about the misrepresentations that Attorney General Bondi made about how she would proceed even-handedly, and, you know, she's wholly abandoned that and is now merely doing the President's bidding when he says, prosecute my enemies, now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. Well, the New York Times is reporting that half a dozen US Attorney's Offices have been ordered to draft plans to investigate a group funded by George Soros, who is a democratic donor. You look at that, you look at the list of names of others who the President has said he specifically wants to be prosecuted or investigated. I'll read a few of them to you: Two former Trump officials, Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor. He also said he wants a federal investigation into former Special Counsel Jack Smith, the DOJ fired the 35 lawyers who were involved in the January 6th and classified documents cases. The Justice Department is now going after Fulton County DA Fani Willis' travel records. We have quite an exhaustive list here. What is the pattern you see?",
      "COBB: Well, I think if you go to 30,000 feet, what you see is a lot of moving parts, but simple themes. The simple themes are rewriting history. Trump wants to rewrite history so that, you know, the next generation may not know that he incited a violent insurrection, refused to peacefully transfer the power of the presidency after losing an election, stole classified documents and showed them to friends and- and guests at Mar-a-Lago, you know, and that he was a criminal. I mean, he's a convicted felon. All- all anybody involved in those events that offended him, they're- they're in real danger. So, you have the rewriting history stuff. You know, the US attorney that he appointed, his personal lawyer, Lindsay Halligan. You know her, her role previously in the administration was, you know, trying to eliminate the theory that, you know, America had slaves at the Smithsonian. She was there to, you know, whitewash the- the Smithsonian and paint America- paint America is something that- that it isn't. I mean, America needs to learn from the mistakes and lessons that we've had, and one of the biggest mistakes that- that America ever had was re-electing President Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, a number of Republican lawmakers are declining to speak out and are leaving the door open that these cases are legitimate. Do you think that the judicial system can resist what you are saying here as just simply politically motivated pressure?",
      "COBB: I think that's an excellent question. I think, you know, the founders, when they- when they drafted the Constitution, Article One is to Congress, and Congress has the greatest powers under the Constitution; spending power, war power, impeachment. Congress is really there to check the presidency. Congress has been neutered by the cowardice of the Republicans. Mike Johnson won't even seat recently elected representative Grijalva because he doesn't want her to tip the balance on the- on the Epstein vote. Congress is totally in the tank and --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sorry, I'm gonna have to cut you off. I'm sorry, because we're out of time there. Ty Cobb, thank you for your time. We'll be right back."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Mike Turner, Republican of Ohio, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we're joined now by Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Good morning. Good to have you here in person.",
      "REP. MIKE TURNER: Thanks. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to talk to you about Ukraine, which you just returned from, but before I do that, let's button up where we left the conversation with Senator Klobuchar. FBI Director Chris Wray was twice spoken about in public statements by the President yesterday, and he said he has some explaining to do. He seemed to be connecting it to the FBI and January 6th. Are you at all concerned by the former director's actions?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, I do think that there- you know, with this new information, there's going to have to be some explaining as to what 6th- what is this new information, and how does this relate to January?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Specifically, the number of the agents? That 274 --",
      "REP. TURNER: Yes. This does seem to be significantly different than what anyone has heard before, and how does this relate to the circumstances of what occurred there. Certainly, Kash Patel, as he's bringing this forward, this is going to be information that I think does relate. It really does go to everyone's confidence of what we currently know about that day. There's been a number of investigations, and a number of people who've looked at this. You know, this certainly is concerning. And I think you know it is better --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, what part is concerning, because that inspector general report said months ago that there were several 100 FBI agents who responded after the Capitol Police asked him to be there?",
      "REP. TURNER: But it's the issue of, you know, what was- what- what was their role? What did they do? You know, that aspect, I think certainly. As we look at this information, as the FBI looks at the information, is it the same? Is it the same information that has been looked at before, or is it different? And that certainly bears review, and that, I think, will occur.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the President says Chris Wray has some explaining to do, how do you interpret that? Because the Inspector General report is public. Kash Patel said those individuals were there. It's not standard to send them, but it was disclosed they were there at the Capitol.",
      "REP. TURNER: I mean, obviously, the current FBI Director, and the FBI is going to have to come forward with the information. That information will be reviewed, and then, ultimately, the FBI is going to have to- and I think that the prior director will have to explain how this information relates to what we've looked at before. And it's either going to be the same and prove that it is as everyone believed the circumstances were before, or it's going to be different. And, at that point, we're going to have to look at, you know, how does it relate to what we believe we knew, and how does it relate to what we now see, what we don't know. Because I have no information, I think no one else has any additional information besides what the news reports are, and we'll have to review what that information is.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But just to be very clear, because it is such a dangerous information environment in so many ways, you are not in any way suggesting that the FBI was secretly agitating, which is what the president said the attack on January 6th?",
      "REP. TURNER: I'm not suggesting anything, and I don't think you are either. I think what we're both suggesting is that this currently is in news reports, and those news reports certainly bear a review of the information that's going to come forward, and that information is either going to tell us that it's the same information that has been seen before, or it's going to be new information. And if it's new information that's going to need to be reviewed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break, and I want to talk about your trip to Ukraine on the other side of it, but I have to do this right now. So stay with us, all of you.",
      "((COMMERCIAL BREAK))",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. We return now to our conversation with Ohio Republican Congressman Mike Turner. Congressman, we were showing video there earlier of the overnight attack Russia carried out against Ukraine. You were just there, in Kyiv. I'm sure you welcomed what the President said this week, when he said he now has changed his mind, and he does believe Ukraine could win this war and get its territory back from Russia. But he also added he wishes everyone well when he made that statement. So is he telling us that the United States is walking away from Ukraine and leaving it up to them, or is he signaling that the United States is going to help Ukraine win that territory back?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, we definitely need to help. And this is part of the dirty secret that really where the United States really needs to step it up, and it's part of the meeting that he had with the president of the EU Commission. You know, the United States is providing aid to Ukraine. But, at the same time, the West, the EU, and the United States is subsidizing Russia and its production machine, because, you know, we're buying from China and India that is buying energy from Russia, and the EU is buying energy from Russia. So we need to place sanctions on Russia so that we're not funding their economy, which is funding their ability to attack and kill Ukraine. So we're funding both sides of this. Unfortunate- unfortunately, there are those in Congress that want to stop supporting Ukraine's ability to defend themselves. Well, that'll just result in more attacks from Russia, as we saw last night, against Ukraine. That's not going to get us to peace. The only way to get us to peace, and Trump's vision of peace, is to impact their ability for production, to stop subsidizing Russia's economy and their ability for production and killing Ukrainians, and that's to adopt Lindsey Graham and Brian Fitzpatrick's bill that would impose sanctions. Give the President the ability to impact Russia's ability to wage this war and get us to peace.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Speaker Johnson has said before that he would put that bill to a vote, he just hasn't. And he has said, oh, I need the president to green light it. That's not true. He has a veto-proof majority. We've had Senator Graham on this program a million times telling us this is set to go, just give us the green light. Did Speaker Johnson respond to your request to move?",
      "REP. TURNER: No, and he's- the momentum is here, we need to do this now. The President doesn't need to give us a green light. He's not a red light. The last time that- and we and we're coming back, and we need to do so, we need to do so now. The last time we put on the floor the bill that would have stopped funding Ukraine, over 300 members voted for it. If we put the bill on the floor to stop the- to put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their economy, it would be similar. Over 300 members would vote for it. The only way to peace is to put sanctions on Russia, continue our support for Ukraine, which is what we're doing, what the President is going to be doing, and bring this war to an end. Support Trump's vision of peace. Put sanctions on Russia, stop funding their- their war economy. Now, what I saw in Ukraine, which is what's really incredible, is that they are winning modern warfare. What they're doing with their anti-drone technology, I mean, they are really the tech bros of the future. They are implementing on the front line, anti-drone air defense technology that is winning this war with our help and assistance, which they're going to continue to need for the long-range systems that Russia is bringing in and that are attacking Kyiv with. But what their anti-drone technology that no one else has, that they are implementing. They are winning this war. We need to be on the side of that war of the future that they're winning and support Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And I've heard military officials explain this to me that this is like a really interesting test case to learn the lessons that Ukraine is illustrating for the world. However, in the immediate term, will the President lift restrictions on Ukraine's ability to use long-range weapons to actually attack Russia?",
      "REP. TURNER: Well, and he really needs to do so, because what's happening with that pressure that's on the front line \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But he has the old Biden policy.",
      "REP. TURNER: Right, well, he does, and that's what he needs to release, because with the pressure on the front line and the fact that Ukraine has developed anti-drone technology, where they're taking down Russian drones, they're using their own drones to attack Russia, but Russia has long-range weapons that they're attacking that front line. Ukraine needs to have the ability to use long-range weapons to push Russia back. And when they're able to do that, they will get their territory back. If they are able to do that, they will win this war. And if we put sanctions on Russia, impacting their ability to produce their war machine and production, they will be able to win this modern warfare, and will be on the right side of what- this is not old-time war. This is modern war, and we're being on the right side of Ukraine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You've just got to persuade President Trump to do that- that change in policy. When we were in France last week speaking to President Macron, I asked him about those incursions into European airspace, some would say by Russian drones or Russian jets, others have said they still need to investigate. We've seen drones or jets into Poland, Estonia, Romania, Norway, possibly Denmark. What should the United States be doing to push back on those provocations?",
      "REP. TURNER: You know, what's interesting about this is it? What we've always said is that, you know, Russia, once they got through Ukraine, would be testing and go- can continue into Europe. But what they're seeing- but what they're seeing now, because they're having this- this success of Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine. They're now going into Poland and Romania, and they're seeing that Poland and Romania don't have the advanced technology that Ukraine does, and instead of going through Ukraine, they're going over Ukraine since- since this is Modern Warfare, and Ukraine is winning it, they're seeing that the old war is actually old Europe.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Mike Turner, thank you for sharing some of your insights, what you learned on the ground in Ukraine.",
      "REP TURNER: Thank you,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And we'll be right back in a moment. So stay with us."

      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Thanks, Margaret, great to be on again.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we just heard from my colleague, Robert Costa that the President indicated to him the likelihood of a shutdown, and with that, potentially mass firings. Do you think this is posturing, or do you worry your fellow Democrats are walking into a trap?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I am glad the president has finally agreed to meet with the leadership in Congress. He canceled the meeting last week, which I think was a big mistake, because this is an opportunity for the country because of one big problem. And that is that the Republicans have created a health care crisis. My constituents, Americans are standing on a cliff right now with these insurance premium increases that are upon them. So Democrats are united in pushing on this and saying, look, let us do something about this crisis before it is too late. Seventy five percent increase in premiums starting November 1, on people who are small business owners, people who are farmers out there, twice as much in the rural areas. So that's what this is about to us, and the President prides himself in the art of a deal, this is the moment for him to meet with Democrats and come to an agreement.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So those premiums go up November 1. You're talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, but insurance companies plan that year out, so these premiums are already priced in here. Why not agree to--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --Margaret, what we know is that these tax--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --government--",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: --If I could just, okay, go ahead, the tax credits are what really could make a difference here for people, because of the fact that we know these premiums hit November 1. Getting this done now is a now thing. It's not a December thing. It's not a January thing. It's not an off ramp. It is something we have to get done now. As one of my farmers that I met with out in rural Minnesota said, when looking at the President's tariffs and looking at what's happened in farm country, five-year high in small farm bankruptcy, he said it's a perfect storm of ugly. That's where we are with the economy right now. And that's why we are pushing on what is one of the biggest cost drivers for Americans, in addition to groceries and electricity prices going up, it's health care.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, you couldn't take the seven week funding and then negotiate that, you're saying it has to be agreed to right now.",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: We believe this is a now problem, and while we are eager to talk with Senator Thune, I know Senator Schumer is to get this moving, in the end, we know that they are rubber stamped for what the President wants. Not everyone is like Rand Paul going off in his own direction and talking about the debt out of the \"Big, Beautiful Bill.\" I don't agree with a lot of what he says, but he's right about that debt. He's right about what happened with that bill, most of them are just going to rubber stamp what President Trump says. That's why it was so important to get this meeting, and I hope he sees it, not as the president, not as political theater, but as real people who are facing a crisis right now, whether it's in the cities, the suburbs or the rural areas of America.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You sit on the Judiciary Committee. So I want to ask you about what's happening right now. Earlier this month, the U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Erik Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York Attorney General Letitia James. We just spoke about her with Robert Costa. Monday, Lindsey Halligan was sworn in as the interim U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. She has never prosecuted a case before. Three days into this new job, she moved forward with the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on two counts. Have you spoken to your fellow Republicans on the Judiciary Committee? Do they have concerns about what's happening in Virginia?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: Well, I plan on doing that this week. And what I see, this as a former prosecutor myself, this is weaponizing the Justice Department, basically taking a career prosecutor who was recommended by the Republican governor of the state of Virginia, clearly has Republican roots, who made a decision based on the evidence over a period of months, made a decision. Then he's pushed out, forced out, so that the President can install his own aid into the job. When I questioned Attorney General Bondi during her confirmation hearing, she assured me that politics would not play a role that they would make independent decisions. That is not what this is. This is a vengeance prosecution. It is not about the law.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You also worked on investigating January 6, 2021, and the attack of the United States Capitol. FBI director, Kash Patel. Yesterday said publicly 274 FBI agents were quote, \"thrown into crowd control on that day against FBI standards.\" President Trump also said publicly that FBI agents acted as agitators who were secretly placed against all rules, regulations, protocols and standards into the crowd prior to and during the attack. This contradicts what the Inspector General said in a published report that said there was no evidence of undercover employees in the crowd, and that there were hundreds of special agents and employees who came in after the Capitol Hill police asked for them. This is now newly in focus, because the President put the focus there, what was the role of the FBI that day?",
      "SEN. KLOBUCHAR: I chaired the investigation of the security problems, along a bipartisan investigation with Senator Peters and then Senator Blunt and Senator Portman. This went on. We had a number of open hearings, and we made major, major recommendations for changes at the Capitol and nowhere was it found that the FBI was acting as agitators. In fact, they were called in when there was such a delay in bringing in the military to insist- to assist in what was essentially an insurrection, where over 100 police officers were injured or maimed because of this criminal activity at the Capitol. So I just find it appalling that the President would say that the FBI was somehow part of this. Kash Patel did clarify that in fact, they were brought in after the fact, but they were brought in because we needed help. Senators, Republicans and Democrats were calling the military leaders. They were calling the Attorney General. They were asking for help because that help was not coming to the Capitol. And everyone has seen those facts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your insight there. We'll be watching what happens here, as the President tweeted both of those things, and in reference to former director Chris Wray, we'll be right back with a lot more Face the Nation. Stay with us."

      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Good morning, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have what, 140,000 federal civilian workers in your state, one of the highest numbers in the nation. How concerned are you that you will see mass layoffs if we go into the shutdown that the White House says they are preparing for?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, and I think your reporter Robert Costa said they're even welcoming it. We are really worried about it, Margaret. When Ted Cruz forced a shutdown of the government in October 2013, it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And when Donald Trump forced a shutdown of the government in late 2018, early 2019 it hurt Virginia pretty bad. And this one would be the same. The only thing about the President's threat to fire more people is he's already doing it, and instead of threatening, he should just be meeting to negotiate. We came near shut down deadlines during the Biden administration, but we never shut government down because the President would sit down with congressional leaders of both parties and would find a path forward. And that's what we've been asking for since the Democrats put an alternate plan on the table on September 18, just sit down and talk with us, and finally, he has agreed to do that tomorrow. But if you're reporting, is to be believed, he's sort of going into it, setting reducing expectations improperly. He should be doing what presidents do and saying, we're going to find a deal to keep the government of the greatest nation on earth open.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it enough of a deal to say, take the short term, seven week funding deal, and we'll continue to talk about these health care subsidies that Democrats say they are so concerned about. I mean, is it really worth the risk?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Here's, here's my thought about this, Margaret. And this is my personal view. We've got to solve this health care issue. And Republicans are saying the same thing. Mike Johnson has said it. Senator Cornyn has said it, Senator Hawley has said it. Senator Murkowski has said it. We're asking to fix a problem that even Republicans want to fix. I don't think we have to have every detail pinned down with all the Is dotted and Ts crossed in order to do a short term extension, but I do want to see that Republicans are saying, You're right. We can fix this, and here's the path to finding a fix. And the second thing we need, which is so reasonable, we're just asking, if we do a deal, please don't, Mr. President, sign the deal, and then immediately the next day start, starting to take away funds, rescinding agreements that you just made yesterday. A deal should be a deal, and we should all agree that Americans should not see their health care suffer, their premiums spike, and people lose insurance and providers close. We've already had providers in Virginia announce that they are closing their doors because of the bill that the Republicans passed in July, and this is happening all over the country. Let's just do what's right by our constituents and fix it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you another question specific to Virginia, and that is, what is going on inside the judicial system. Back in August, it was the US Attorney for the Western District of Virginia, Todd Gilbert, who suddenly resigned. Then earlier this month, the US Attorney in the Eastern District of Virginia, Eric Siebert resigned after failing to bring a case against New York's Attorney General, Letitia James. What is going on here in the Virginia court system? Margaret?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: It's pretty darn plain the President nominated two U.S. attorneys in Virginia, both with Republican bona fides. Todd Gilbert in the Western District, had been the Republican Speaker of our house of delegates. He resigned as a legislator to take the Trump appointment. President Trump's team interviewed these candidates, approved the candidates, nominated the candidates, and then even appointed them into the interim position. But both were forced out because they said their integrity as prosecutors would not allow them to genuflect to Donald Trump. And in Todd Gilbert's case, they wanted to force him to demote a long time career member of the Western District of Virginia who had served under multiple administrations and presidents. He refused to do so. And in Eric Siebert's case, he refused to bring a criminal charge against a perceived Trump political opponent when there was no evidence to support the charge. President Trump is spending time going after enemies, trying to figure out a way to give $20 billion to a friend, the Argentine Government, instead of dealing with the challenges we elected him to confront. Food prices are going up. Building supplies are going up. School supplies are going up. Energy costs are going up, health care costs are going up, and Donald Trump seems to be focused on a retribution campaign. You got to focus, man, this is an important job. It's time to focus.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When it comes to those Virginia cases, have you talked to Siebert, have you talked to Gilbert to understand why they felt they had to resign?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: I have talked to each of them after the resignations were done. These were individuals I knew both. I knew Todd Gilbert because of his legislative role, and I knew Eric Siebert very well by reputation. And again, this was the prosecutor Margaret, who, when the Biden administration transitioned to the Trump administration, the Trump administration DOJ put him in the role as an interim even before we recommended him, along with our republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, as you mentioned. So after they had been fired, yes, I did call and say I'd like to understand why you were forced out, and they shared thoughts with me without getting into anything about particular cases or particular communication they'd had with Trump administration officials. But I am convinced, and Virginians are convinced. I traveled around the state this week. People are talking about this. Both of these individuals had a backbone. They wouldn't genuflect to Donald Trump, and they wouldn't bring baseless cases, and we shouldn't see that in any district in this nation. And it's sad that President Trump is more focused on retribution than serving his constituents.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, that Eastern District did come forward with this, this indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. Yes, it was just a two page indictment, no evidence presented publicly here, but it was convincing enough to 14 of 23 people sitting on a grand jury. Can you really say there's no there there?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, a bare majority, as you know, Margaret, there's 23 people on a grand jury. They need at least 12 votes to get an indictment, and yes, they got their finger over the bar with 14, although the four- the 23 wouldn't agree on one of the charges that the US attorney was pushing. So we will see what this case is about. It is odd that the indictment has so few facts, and I found it very odd. I used to practice in this court, and when the Attorney General put out a press statement after the indictment and said, we will follow the facts in this case. What prosecutors follow the facts before they indict, they don't indict, and then say, well, let's see what the facts are. I think she even revealed that this is a weak case, which everyone in her office was telling her it was a weak case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You in your armed services role. I want to quickly ask you, you have said you are supportive of the creation of a Palestinian state, and we saw at the UN this past week, a large number of members just simply walked out when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke, it was a statement tomorrow he's going to be at the White House ahead of that meeting, President Trump said this:",
      "VO SOT PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank. There's been enough. It's time to stop now, okay?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That's a strong statement. Do you know how the United States should enforce that? How do you force Israel to step back from annexation?",
      "SEN. TIM KAINE: Well, I was very heartened that the President said that, and you're right. I support what the United States voted for in the UN in 1947 a state of Israel and a state of Palestine. One of those promises has been met. One hasn't, and we need to be on a path for a Palestinian state that's demilitarized, where Hamas plays no role in its governance. And until we find that path forward, we're going to have continued cycles of violence that are bad for Israelis, bad for Palestinians, bad for the region. So I hope the president, who, by all accounts, has a strong relationship with Prime Minister Netanyahu, makes plain that we are, we are against annexation, and this 21 point proposal that the President has on the table, which is pretty similar to the New York dialog being led by the French and the Saudis. They're different efforts, but they're trying to reach the same point, a future state for Israel and Palestine, where both can live in peace, and creating stability in the region instead of the cycles of violence. So I hope the president leans into that at the meeting tomorrow. I was heartened by his comment. It would be a big mistake for the Prime Minister Netanyahu to look at all of these nations that have been allies, saying you need to change course, and for him to just pull his head in the shell and turn inward and continue to isolate Israel, rather than move forward toward peace and more stability in the region.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine, thank you for your insights today. We'll be back in a moment."

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sept. 28, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to go now to the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, Senator Rand Paul, who joins us from Bowling Green, Kentucky. Good morning to you, Senator.",
      "SEN. RAND PAUL: Good morning. Thanks for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I want to start on that news you just heard, that the President is basically expecting a shutdown and possibly to carry out these mass layoffs. Do you think all of this is just a threat to make Democrats fold?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Well, I think both sides have to look at the proposals for spending and decide, you know, what is the best way forward for the country. The Republican proposal adds about $2 trillion in debt over the next year, so it'll be short $2 trillion. So I oppose the Republican plan because it adds debt. The Democrat plan would add $3 trillion in debt. So really, both plans are laden with deficit spending, and I think that's the biggest problem that our country faces. So I've actually proposed an alternative. I proposed a penny plan, which would cut a little bit across the board, and my plan would balance over about five years, we got a vote on mine last week, and 36 Republicans supported it, 16 didn't and no Democrats did. So my plan didn't pass either, but the plan that I would support would be a plan that reduces spending and reduces deficit spending.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we have this immediate deadline, though, of this week, and we know leaders are going to the White House. If we end up in this shutdown. Do you think it is appropriate and illegal for the executive to carry out the kind of mass firings that the budget director laid out in that memo this past week?",
      "SEN. PAUL: You know, there's been several cases adjudicated now all the way to the Supreme Court, and the President seems to have won every one of them on his ability to hire and fire within the executive branch. And I think this is understandable, because in the executive branch if the president can't fire him, who can? and so I think the President has a great out",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Without consulting congress?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Over executive branch employees- for hiring and firing people in the executive branch? I think he has a great deal of leeway. The court has upheld this repeatedly, and so I suspect they will, even when Congress- you know, the Democrats try to protect this agency called the Consumer Financial Protection Board, and they say, well, the funding will come from the Fed. You won't get to vote on the funding, and the person hired can't be fired. Well, he did fire that person in 2020 and the courts upheld that in 2021, in the Supreme Court, and really since then, every case he has won. And as you know, I'm a equal parts critic of both Republicans and Democrats. I've criticized Trump on things, but the one thing is on the hiring and firing. I think he's going to win every one of those cases.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your role in Homeland Security. You are chairman of that oversight committee. The President announced yesterday, and I'm sure you saw his social media post, that he's going to send troops to Portland, Oregon. He called it a 'war ravaged' city. He said he's also going to send troops to any immigration facilities around the country which are, quote, 'under siege from attack by antifa, and other domestic terrorists.' End quote. He said he's authorizing full force if necessary. Do you know what full force means here? Do you know what's in store?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think he has the legal authority to send troops to protect federal buildings and federal proceedings such as courts, and that's been around since Civil Rights Era. We've acknowledged that the federal government will sometimes come in despite what states say. I do think it's better when the states agree to it. For example, I mean, in Chicago- Chicago is a nightmare. It is literally a war zone, and the people being hurt, the worst are those who are poor and living in these communities. I've been to the most dangerous precinct in Chicago, and it's just despair and sadness and these young boys are growing up with no families\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on the plans for Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: There's no restaurants, no drugs- excuse me?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you haven't been briefed on plans to send troops to Oregon?",
      "SEN. PAUL: Not for Portland, no.",
      "[CROSSTALK ENDS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because we have not yet seen troops in Chicago, though you're referencing the President's past threats to do so. In Oregon, the governor said there's no need, and they don't want these troops, but the mayor said- the mayor of Portland, federal agents have been arriving along with some armored vehicles. Are you comfortable with pushing the limits here of some of these uses of either potentially troops or federal agents.",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think both the people in Portland and across America have to decide about this. You know, we had anarchy in Portland for like, six months or a year. The city didn't even control large swaths of the city. These had federal buildings on them, and so I think there is a role for the federal government. Am I excited about it? No. I'd prefer not to have troops in our cities, or I'd prefer them only to come, you know, with the acceptance of the local authorities. But I do think there is a role if the states will not step up. Portland did not step up, and they let their city go, you know, they let it burn for goodness sakes, and then they let a whole area become the city, you know, these blocks of anarchy where some sort of local thug rule was a- was- was going on. So I don't know, I think ultimately what's going to happen. And I think some of this is the President showing the politics of Republicans versus Democrats is eventually cities like Chicago and Portland are going to give up on Democrats because their people are dying. It's their people in their community. The people have been supporting the Democrat party for decade after decade. They are the ones dying. It's not the people in the rich neighborhoods that are country club Republican, it's the poor people in every city is dying. Well, you know the cities have to step up on this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I'm asking about your oversight role, because it seemed like the President's statement yesterday, it took a turn. It wasn't how he talked about Chicago. In fact, when he was speaking in this social media post about Portland, he used language here about domestic terrorists. And we know just a few days ago, the President did issue that executive order saying he wanted to declare this anti fascist group, antifa, to be a domestic terrorist organization. Have you seen evidence that these left wing activists are now becoming a more organized group with national leadership, something the FBI has said in the past, that they're really more of an ideology?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I think you lose the description as activists once you start wielding weapons, and you show up with helmets and you're breaking windows. That's what was going on apparently in Portland, at the ICE building. I do think, though, that it's important when people start talking about labeling people, that we realize everybody, the worst among us, even those accused of heinous crimes, will get due process. So we can't single out a group and say, oh, they're not going to get due process because we're calling them terrorists. So I'd be careful of the labels, but I'm absolutely for going after the people wielding clubs and sticks and fighting with the police and trying to get into the federal buildings. They have to be punished, and they will be.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you have concerns about designating groups with these anti-government sentiments as domestic terrorist groups. I mean, do you start worrying about Fourth Amendment violations?",
      "SEN. PAUL: I don't know that it's helpful to label groups, particularly since antifa, there are some real people in antifa, they're real violent people, but it is an amorphous group in the sense that I don't think they have a president, they don't have a local chapter. It is more an ideology. And it was useful, maybe around the world, to call things terrorism. But there's different rules of engagement. When we have to go after terrorist in the Middle East, we send- we send a Hellfire missile or a drone, often. In the United States, it's much tricker to be a police. I have a great deal of respect for our police because you're right. They have to respect the Fourth Amendment, the First Amendment, and so we have to be careful with labels, but that doesn't mean we should go soft on antifa and these people that are committing violence.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, Senator Rand Paul, thank you for your time this morning, 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

The White House has offered scant information about how the operations came together or the legal authorities under which they were carried out.",
      "Earlier this year, Petro resisted deportation flights using American military aircraft, leading to a diplomatic crisis as Trump threatened to retaliate with higher tariffs and visa suspensions. The U.S. is Colombia's largest trading partner, and Petro's government relented, saying it would accept the planes.",
      "The U.S. accused Colombia earlier this month of failing to cooperate with anti-narcotics efforts. Although the designation did not include sanctions that would have slashed U.S. assistance to the country, it was a sharp rebuke that frustrated Petro.",

    "summary": "Experts question the popular social media trend of using magnesium products on the feet for better sleep due to a lack of research backing the claims.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Wendy Troxel, a sleep therapist in Utah, discusses a study that found small bouts of light exercise in the evening can help promote more restful sleep.",
      "Magnesium is an essential mineral that supports many basic bodily functions.",
      "It is important for a healthy heart, nerves, muscles and bones, and also helps to regulate calcium and blood sugar levels. The mineral is also vital for protein production, according to Harvard Health.",
      "And now, a new trend on social media claims that magnesium can also promote better sleep, although experts warn there is limited scientific evidence.",
      "HIDDEN SLEEP DANGER COULD INCREASE RISK OF 172 DISEASES, MAJOR STUDY REVEALS",
      "In particular, TikTokers have posted about the effects of magnesium lotion, oils and sprays to induce sleepiness when used on the bottoms of the feet.",
      "One user (@gandyscraftcorner) posted a video that received nearly 20,000 likes with the caption, \"POV: you start putting magnesium lotion on your feet every night before bed and suddenly your insulin and cortisol levels are balancing out \u2026 Sleep quality is better than ever and restless leg symptoms have disappeared.\"",
      "Some TikTok users claim that putting magnesium lotion on the feet promotes better sleep. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Brendan Camp, M.D., a New York-based dermatologist, raised doubts about the claims in an interview with Fox News Digital.",
      "Camp said more research is necessary to determine whether applying magnesium-containing products on the skin increases magnesium levels, therefore promoting sleep.",
      "ALZHEIMER'S RISK COULD RISE WITH SPECIFIC SLEEP PATTERN, EXPERTS WARN",
      "\"In addition, the skin on the plantar surface of the foot is very thick,\" he noted. \"Much of the product that is applied is probably not absorbed systemically, but rather remains on the skin's surface.\"",
      "In a separate interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Wendy Troxel, a Utah-based sleep psychologist at the RAND Corporation, commented that it\u2019s \"easy to see why magnesium lotion is tempting.\"",
      "A dermatologist noted that most of a magnesium-based lotion most likely does not get absorbed into the skin. (iStock)",
      "\"Everyone is looking for that magic solution to support better sleep, especially when a product is trending or seems like a natural remedy,\" she said. \"However, current scientific evidence does not support magnesium lotion as a sleep aid.\"",
      "The research on magnesium's impact on sleep, whether taken orally or applied topically, is \"limited and equivocal at best,\" according to Troxel.",
      "DEMENTIA RISK NEARLY DOUBLES AMONG THOSE WITH COMMON SLEEP DISORDER, STUDY FINDS",
      "The sleep expert hypothesized that the benefits of a foot massage as part of a nightly routine may contribute to sleepiness more than the actual lotion.",
      "\"Everyone is looking for that magic solution to support better sleep, especially when a product is trending or seems like a natural remedy.\"",
      "\"Massage helps activate the body\u2019s relaxation response and can make a real difference when winding down prior to bedtime,\" she said.",
      "Healthy sleep foundations",
      "Prioritizing the \"evidence-based\" foundations of sleep health is more important than following what\u2019s on-trend, according to Troxel.",
      "These foundations include having a consistent bedtime and wake-up time, avoiding technology use at night, and cultivating a cool, dark and quiet sleeping environment.",
      "Tech use before bed can disrupt sleep due to its stimulating and \"often addicting\" content and light exposure, Troxel cautioned.",
      "A sleep expert recommends prioritizing the \"evidence-based\" foundations of sleep health. (iStock)",

      "\"What really matters is making your nighttime routine consistent and predictable, so your body and brain get clear signals that it\u2019s time for sleep.\"",
      "In addition to massage, Troxel suggested trying other methods to \"calm a racing mind\" at night, including a nightly gratitude practice, which can \"shift your focus and promote relaxation.\"",

      "A \"scheduled worry exercise\" can also be a powerful tool, she said. This involves setting a timer for 15 minutes and writing down every worrying thought that comes to mind until the time is up, then shutting the journal.",
      "Tech use before bed can disrupt sleep due to its stimulating and \"often addicting\" content and light exposure, a sleep expert said. (iStock)",
      "Studies show that this exercise can help prevent anxious ruminations and make it easier to transition into sleep.",
      "For those who may be using a magnesium product to manage leg cramps or uncomfortable tingling sensations, Troxel warned that these symptoms may be a sign of restless leg syndrome, a clinical sleep disorder commonly associated with iron deficiency.",

    "summary": "Personal trainers explain how older adults can exercise safely by avoiding common mistakes like ego lifting, skipping strength training and having inadequate recovery time.",
    "story": [
      "Marfred Suazo, known online as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, speaks about the importance of building muscle for daily functioning and longevity.",
      "Experts agree that exercise is vital to longevity and helps to preserve muscle mass, bone density and joint health as we age. But it\u2019s important to approach workouts in the right way to ensure safe, optimal results.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, along with at least two days of strength training and activities to improve balance.",
      "However, these recommendations should be modified to meet each individual\u2019s physical abilities and conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "FITNESS EXPERT REVEALS 6 PILLARS OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT OLDER ADULTS SHOULD MASTER",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" Marfred Suazo, a fitness professional known as Fonz the Trainer in New York City, told Fox News Digital.",
      "The general guideline is for healthy adults to get 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week. (iStock)",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Fox News Digital spoke with fitness experts to identify some of the most common mistakes older adults make when working out and how to avoid them.",
      "\"Most people focus only on the chest, arms, quads and abs, because that is what they see in the mirror,\" Suazo said. \"But ignoring your back, glutes, hamstrings and core creates poor posture, weak links and, eventually, pain.\"",
      "OLDER ADULTS SHOULD TARGET THESE MUSCLES WHEN STRENGTH-TRAINING, SAYS FITNESS PRO",
      "To counteract this, Suazo recommends training the muscles you cannot see, a strategy he calls \"non-mirror training.\"",
      "\"Add rows, Romanian dead lifts, hip bridges, Paloff presses and farmer\u2019s carries to your routine,\" he advised. \"This type of training builds strength that shows up in your posture, balance and the way you move every day.\"",
      "Orrie Markfeld, a personal trainer at Life Time Garden City in New York, said a common mistake he sees is older adults trying to work out with the same intensity and volume as when they were younger, which often leads to overuse injuries and burnout.",
      "\"Most adults are not failing in the gym because they are lazy. They are failing because no one ever taught them how to train for the stage of life they are in right now,\" a fitness trainer said. (iStock)",
      "\"The solution is simple: train smarter,\" he recommended to Fox News Digital. \"Follow principles of progressive overload and proper mechanics and make recovery days a priority.",
      "\"Longer warm-ups, mobility prep and respecting rest go a long way toward preventing setbacks.\"",
      "\"Walking, biking and spin classes are great, but if you avoid strength training, you lose muscle and power with every passing year,\" Sauzo told Fox News Digital. \"That makes you more likely to get hurt and slows recovery.\"",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, according to the expert.",
      "\"They keep doing the same workouts they did years ago and wonder why their back aches, their knees are sore and their progress has stalled.\"",
      "Suazo confirmed that adults should strength train at least two times per week. \"Start light, master the form and progress slowly,\" he recommends.",
      "Markfeld agreed that many older adults stick only to cardio, thinking it\u2019s all they need.",
      "Building muscle helps protect the joints, speeds up metabolism and ensures strength for life, experts say. (iStock)",
      "\"The problem is, skipping resistance training accelerates muscle and bone loss, which are critical for staying active and independent,\" he reiterated.",
      "\"Including two to three days a week of strength and resistance-specific work is ideal. This can be as simple as body weight movements, resistance bands or dumbbells, focusing on compound/functional movements like squats, pushes and pulls.\"",
      "Going straight from sitting at a desk to lifting weights is a recipe for injury, according to Suazo.",
      "\"Cold muscles and stiff joints make even simple exercises harder than they should be,\" he warned.",
      "HOLLYWOOD ICON HAS USED THE SAME 12-MINUTE WORKOUT ROUTINE SINCE THE 1960S",
      "To help ensure a safe, successful workout, Suazo recommends spending five minutes preparing your body. This can include walking as well as doing hip openers, shoulder circles and a few body weight squats.",
      "\"You will lift better, feel better and recover faster,\" the expert said.",
      "\"Fast, sloppy reps and ego lifting are the reason most people end up with sore shoulders and bad backs,\" Suazo cautioned.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The trainer emphasized the importance of slowing down.",
      "\"Choose a weight you can control, move with intention and feel the muscles working,\" he said. \"Controlled reps will keep you safe and build strength you can use.\"",
      "\"If you are sore all the time, you are not getting stronger, you are just breaking your body down,\" Suazo said. \"Strength is built when you recover, not just when you train.\"",
      "When you train this way, you will move better, feel younger and keep doing the things you love without pain holding you back,\" a trainer said. (iStock)",
      "It\u2019s important to make recovery part of your plan, the expert advised. This can include walking, stretching, taking an active recovery day and getting quality sleep.",
      "\"Your body will reward you by coming back stronger.\"",
      "\"Many people overlook mobility and balance work,\" Markfeld noted. \"These decline naturally with age and are major factors in injury risk.\"",
      "\"Focus on non-mirror training, slow your movements down and respect your recovery time.\"",
      "He suggests dedicating 10 to 15 minutes of every workout to joint mobility, core stability and balance exercises.",
      "\"Simple drills like ankle mobility before squats or single-leg balance work can have a huge payoff in long-term health,\" Markfeld said.",
      "For more Health articles, visit\u00a0www.foxnews.com/health",

      "Republican and Democratic congressional leaders left a meeting with President Donald Trump with no deal to avert a government shutdown as the deadline fast approaches.",
      "Leaders met with Trump on Monday for roughly an hour to negotiate a path forward to avert a partial government shutdown, but it appeared neither side was willing to budge from their position.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said after the meeting, \"I think we're headed into a shutdown because the Democrats won't do the right thing. I hope they change their mind.\"",
      "\"If you look at the original they did with this negotiation, it was a $1.5 trillion spending package, basically saying the American people want to give massive amounts of money, hundreds of billions of dollars to illegal aliens for their health care, while Americans are struggling to pay their health care bills,\" Vance said. \"That was their initial foray into this negotiation. We thought it was absurd.\"",

      "Democrats, however, have pushed back on assertions that they\u2019re looking to salvage healthcare for anyone but the American people.",
      "\"There was a frank and direct discussion with the President of the United States and Republican leaders. But significant and meaningful differences remain,\" Jeffries said. \"Democrats are fighting to protect the health care of the American people, and we are not going to support a partisan Republican spending bill that continues to gut the health care of every day America, period.\"",
      "Congress has until midnight Oct. 1 to pass a short-term funding extension, or continuing resolution (CR), to avert a partial government shutdown. The House already passed a funding extension, but the bill was blocked in the Senate earlier this month.",
      "Republicans and the White House want to move forward with their \"clean,\" short-term funding extension until Nov. 21, while Democrats have offered a counter-proposal that includes a permanent extension of expiring Obamacare tax credits and other wishlist items that are a bridge too far for the GOP.",
      "Vance appeared alongside Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought in a show of Republican unity after the meeting, but made clear both sides are still far apart.",
      "Thune, holding up a copy of the funding extension, panned Jeffries and Schumer\u2019s accusation that the bill was partisan in nature.",
      "Congressional Republicans argue that the House GOP\u2019s is everything that Democrats pushed when they controlled the Senate: a \"clean,\" short-term extension to Nov. 21 without partisan policy riders or spending, save for millions in new spending for increased security for lawmakers.",

      "\"To me, this is purely a hostage-taking exercise on the part of the Democrats,\" Thune said. \"We are willing to sit down and work with them on some of the issues they want to talk about, whether it's an extension of premium tax credits, with reforms, we're happy to have that conversation. But as of right now, this is a hijacking.\"",
      "Neither Schumer nor Jeffries took questions after their remarks, but appeared slightly more optimistic than their GOP counterparts after the meeting concluded.",
      "\"I think for the first time, the president heard our objections and heard why we needed a bipartisan bill,\" Schumer said. \"Their bill has not one iota of Democratic input. That is never how we've done this before.\"",
      "Vance said he was \"highly skeptical\" that it was Trump\u2019s first time hearing the issue and said there was a bipartisan path forward on healthcare \u2013 but panned Democrats\u2019 push to include an extension of COVID-19 pandemic-era Affordable Care Act (ACA) extensions in the bill.",
      "\"We want to work across the aisle to make sure that people have access to good healthcare,\" he said, but added, \"We are not going to let Democrats shut down the government and take a hostage unless we give them everything that they want. That's not how the people's government has ever worked.\"",
      "The meeting in the Oval Office comes after Trump canceled a previously scheduled confab last week with just Schumer and Jeffries. At the time, the president railed against their demands on his social media platform Truth Social and contended that congressional Democrats were pushing \"radical Left policies that nobody voted for\" in their counter-CR.",

      "Senate Republicans have argued that Democrats\u2019 desires are unserious, and Thune has publicly said that Republicans would be willing to have discussions on the ACA subsidies, which are set to sunset at the end of this year, after the government is funded.",
      "Schumer insisted Democrats needed it addressed immediately, however, in a press conference back on Capitol Hill after the meeting.",
      "\"We think when they say later, they mean never. We have to do it now, first because of the timing issue and second, because now is the time we can get it done,\" he said.",

      "Progressives excoriated Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., in March when he reluctantly provided Democratic votes to break a filibuster to avoid a government shutdown.",
      "Democrats on both sides of Capitol Hill were apoplectic. They felt betrayed by Schumer. The New York Democrat caved to Republicans to avert the shutdown without pocketing any political concessions in return. At the time, Schumer said a shutdown under those conditions would be worse.

      "And so liberals thought that Schumer may have overstayed his welcome, and it was time to move on.",
      "Schumer didn\u2019t provide the necessary votes to avoid a shutdown when the Senate took a test vote to clear the way for the House-approved interim spending bill a week-and-a-half ago. So that made Schumer an easy target of the right. Plus, calling it the \"Schumer Shutdown\" is alliterative. It rolls off the tongue and easy for the GOP to characterize what\u2019s going on.",

      "This explains how Republicans are trying to always flag a potential challenge to Schumer by Ocasio-Cortez. They portray Schumer as finding himself in a tight spot, having to appeal to the left-leaning base of the Democratic Party. If Democrats fold, they face an avalanche of criticism from progressives.",

Political observers consistently mention Ocasio-Cortez among the top four potential Democratic presidential candidates were she to run in 2028.

On its face, government funding has nothing to do with what congressional Republicans approved under the hallmark of Trump\u2019s legislative agenda. But, as we said, this is one of those inflection points. So it\u2019s an opportunity for Democrats to emphasize what Republicans passed and portray it as a negative ahead of the 2026 midterms.",
      "Secondly, Democrats are pushing for a renewal of subsidies for Obamacare to make healthcare costs more affordable. If Congress fails to act, costs spike for tens of millions of Americans. Granted, those subsidies don\u2019t expire until the end of the calendar year. Not the government\u2019s fiscal year on Oct. 1. But households will start receiving notices in the mail soon about prospective price hikes. Time the arrival of those notices with a protracted government shutdown and the Democratic arguments might start to resonate with voters.",

      "What's new in school security",
      "The district is using ZeroEyes, an AI video analytics platform that integrates with existing security cameras. The software scans for visible firearms and sends an alert whenever a potential threat appears. A team of military and law enforcement veterans at a 24/7 operations center then reviews the image to confirm whether the gun is real. Once verified, the system pushes an alert to school staff and police within three to five seconds. At the same time, buildings go into lockdown automatically.",
      "South Jersey schools have deployed AI to spot weapons and alert police in seconds. (Jay Janner/The Austin American-Statesman via Getty Images)",
      "These alerts are distributed through Singlewire Software's InformaCast platform. This system can send warnings across school PA systems, strobe lights, digital signs, desk phones and other communication tools. Together, the two technologies give law enforcement and educators a faster and more coordinated way to respond to potential dangers.",
      "How the system works",
      "Security cameras around each building feed video into the ZeroEyes software. When the AI detects what appears to be a firearm, it highlights the object and immediately shares the footage with human analysts. If those experts confirm that the weapon is real, they send the alert to the district and local authorities. InformaCast then pushes the message to every connected device, allowing staff and students to receive instructions within seconds. The goal is to shorten the time between detection and action so schools can respond before violence has a chance to unfold.",
      "Concerns to consider",
      "As with any new technology, questions remain. Even with human oversight, AI can make mistakes, and false alerts are always a possibility. Privacy also comes into play since the system depends on constant monitoring through security cameras. Cost is another factor because installing, maintaining and training staff for these systems requires significant funding. Finally, schools need to build community trust by explaining how the technology works and preparing students and parents for what to expect during drills or emergencies.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE ABUSING ICLOUD CALENDAR TO SEND PHISHING EMAILS",
      "Glassboro district becomes first in U.S. to pair AI gun detection with mass alerts. (Lori Van Buren/Albany Times Union via Getty Images)",
      "What this means for you",
      "For parents, teachers and students, this technology represents an important shift in how schools approach safety. AI adds speed to the process by recognizing threats before most people would even notice them. Alerts reach law enforcement and staff almost immediately, creating a critical advantage in a crisis. The system also provides a layered approach to protection by combining cameras, AI and communication tools. Parents may also find reassurance in knowing that human experts verify each threat to help reduce false alarms. While no system is perfect, this integration builds confidence that schools are investing in stronger defenses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The decision to use AI gun detection with instant communication tools marks a major change in how schools can protect their communities. The Glassboro rollout demonstrates how technology can detect threats and share critical information in seconds. While no solution eliminates every risk, this approach gives schools more time to react when lives are at stake.",

      "When you search Google for apps, it feels natural to trust the first results you see. They're supposed to be the most reliable, right? Unfortunately, hackers know this too. They're sneaking fake websites into search results that look just like the real thing. If you click and download from one of these sites, you could end up with malware instead of the app you wanted. In other words, the top search results aren't always safe, and that's exactly how scammers trick people.",

      "Researchers at FortiGuard Labs found that attackers are setting up websites that look almost identical to trusted providers. These sites host installers for apps like Signal, WhatsApp, Deepl, Chrome, Telegram, Line, VPN services and WPS Office. The catch is that these downloads include both the real app and hidden malware.",
      "Once you run one, the malware drops files into your system, asks for administrator access and quietly starts spying. It can collect personal information, log everything you type, monitor your screen and even disable your antivirus.",
      "Hackers are planting fake apps in Google search results and they look just like the real thing. (Harun Ozalp /Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Some versions were designed to snoop on Telegram messages. All of this is possible because hackers use a tactic called SEO poisoning, which manipulates Google's search results so their fake websites appear near the top. Even if you stick to \"safe-looking\" search links, you could still land on a fraudulent page.",
      "How hackers disguise fake apps as real ones",
      "So how do these fake sites end up in your search results in the first place? The attackers use a technique called SEO poisoning. They register lookalike domains, use plugins to game search algorithms and then climb up Google's rankings. That way, when you search for a trusted app, the fake site may appear as one of the first results.",
      "According to FortiGuard Labs, this particular campaign mainly targeted Chinese-speaking users, but the method is being used everywhere. In fact, earlier reports from Cisco Talos showed ransomware groups pushing fake downloads of AI tools like ChatGPT or InVideo. Others used spoofed sites for PayPal, Microsoft, Netflix and Apple. Sometimes, attackers even buy sponsored ads so that their malicious links appear right at the top.",
      "The scary part is that you might not even realize you installed something dangerous. Because the fake installer includes the real app, everything seems to work fine. Meanwhile, the hidden malware is already active on your device. That makes it harder to detect and much easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from malware in Google Searches",
      "I have listed some steps below that you can take to protect yourself from these fake apps and the malware they carry.",
      "The safest way to avoid malware is to get software directly from the official website or verified app stores like Google Play or the Apple App Store. Avoid third-party download sites or search results that look suspicious, even if they appear at the top of Google.",
      "Before clicking \"download,\" carefully inspect the domain name. Hackers often create lookalike domains that look nearly identical to real ones, adding small spelling changes or extra words. Even small differences can indicate a fake site designed to deliver malware.",

      "Cybercriminals are disguising malware as trusted apps, tricking users through poisoned search results. (Dilara Irem Sancar/Anadolu via Getty Images)",

      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",
      "DON\u2019T FALL FOR THIS BANK PHISHING SCAM TRICK",
      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Regularly updating your operating system, browser and applications helps patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit in phishing scams. Staying current with updates minimizes your exposure to known threats.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

The setup usually looks harmless: someone sends you a check for more than the agreed amount, asks you to forward the difference and disappears once the check bounces.

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",
      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services and get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

      "But every once in a while, a new model rolls onto the scene that flips that thinking on its head. Meet the Robeta Ananya. This isn't just a van: it's a \"glamper\" on wheels, and it makes other builds look like tin cans.",

      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "A true living room, not just a chair",
      "Robeta makes it clear they really mean luxury. Instead of adding the typical swivel seat like most models, they built an actual, fully realized living room. There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",
      "Robeta Mobil is offering a luxury camping experience via its newest camper model, available in 2026. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

      "Robeta Mobil says that its Ananya model will offer a luxury experience on the road. (Robeta Mobil)",
      "A kitchen you'll actually use",
      "Over in the kitchen, things continue to impress. You get a Corian countertop, a proper two-burner gas stove, a grill and oven combo, and a roomy 130-liter fridge and freezer. This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",
      "Robeta Ananya price in the U.S. and how to buy one",
      "The Robeta Ananya is pure luxury on wheels, and its price reflects that. In the United States, the limited Founders' Edition starts at about $295,000. Only five of these exclusive models will be built, with deliveries starting in January 2026. If you want one, you'll need to act quickly. Robeta is taking U.S. orders directly through its website.",

It delivers a real living room, a full kitchen and a bathroom that feels like it belongs in a home. You can wash clothes on the road, sleep in a proper bed and stay powered up for days without plugging in. This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

      "The Robeta Ananya proves that camper vans can be more than cramped compromises. With thoughtful design, smart use of space and luxury features, it invites you to travel farther and stay longer in comfort. Whether you want to roam the backroads or set up in scenic spots for days, this van makes it easy to do both in style.",

      "Kirk, an outspoken conservative whose organization sought to promote right-of-center thinking on traditionally liberal campuses, was shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University on Sept. 10. Robinson allegedly told his roommate and romantic partner that he did it because he \"had enough of [Kirk's] hatred. Some hate can't be negotiated out.\"",
      "The partner, who was identified as trans, is cooperating with investigators.",
      "\"Obviously they've got the concern about defending their client, they've got concerns about the media attention, but I also think that they may have concerns about their personal safety,\" Rice said. \"This certainly is a political assassination. It's something that has been in the headlines. There are a lot of individuals who are emotional about this. And certainly people on the left are certainly emotional about it. People on the right are certainly emotional about it. And so there are concerns from the defense team's perspective. About their personal safety and that's something they're going to have to consider throughout this entire trial.\"",

      "Authorities say they've recovered messages to his romantic partner and other friends taking responsibility for the shooting. According to a probable cause affidavit, he had \"confessed...or implied\" guilt to a close family friend. The Washington County Sheriff's Office later said his parents convinced him to surrender peacefully rather than take his own life.",
      "Police recovered a rifle at the scene that investigators allege had Robinson's DNA on it. They also have surveillance video on the campus and nearby roads and a footprint on the rooftop where a sniper fired the bullet that killed Kirk.",
      "According to court documents, the suspect used his phone on school grounds at least once, on video. That could provide police with additional evidence. They also identified a suspect vehicle, a gray Dodge Challenger, like the one Robinson drives.",

      "And as Fox News Digital reported Thursday, an officer guarding the campus perimeter \"made contact\" with Robinson near where police recovered the suspected murder weapon as he was allegedly texting his roommate about wanting to retrieve it before skipping town, according to law enforcement sources.",
      "Defending a death penalty case will require Robinson's legal team to hire forensic specialists, mental health evaluators and jury consultants, among other measures, Rice said, but his lawyers may have to fight for funding or risk being \"hamstrung\" before the case goes to trial.",
      "Kirk's family may also weigh in before prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal. His widow, Erika Kirk, said during her husband's memorial service Sunday said she has already forgiven Robinson \"because it was what Christ did, and it's what Charlie would do.\"",
      "Separately, she said she did not want to get involved in the decision to seek capital punishment in an interview with the New York Times.",
      "\"I\u2019ll be honest,\" she told the paper. \"I told our lawyer, I want the government to decide this. I do not want that man\u2019s blood on my ledger. Because when I get to heaven, and Jesus is like: \u2018Uh, eye for an eye? Is that how we do it?\u2019 And that keeps me from being in heaven, from being with Charlie?\"",

      "If prosecutors decide to offer a plea deal, it may not look like the recent plea for Bryan Kohberger in the Idaho student murders case, according to Louis Gelormino, a Staten Island defense attorney who is following the case.",
      "\"One of the things that surprised me out there in Kohberger was they didn\u2019t let him allocute to the crimes,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Usually, when you take a plea, you have to confess to your crimes. I would imagine here, if they do take that off the table and they do get a plea out of him, that he\u2019ll have to allocute and explain his crime in public.\"",
      "He said he expects Robinson's team to explore a potential insanity defense, but his alleged escape from Orem and week spent plotting the crime could complicate that argument. He also expects defense attorneys to challenge as much evidence as possible in case prosecutors or police failed to \"cross all their Ts and dot all their Is,\" he said.",

      "DENVER \u2013 A former FBI agent says a serial killer who doubled as an FBI informant for years manipulated agents into believing he was helping them, all the while preying on unsuspecting victims.",
      "Scott Kimball will likely spend the rest of his life in a federal prison in Colorado after he was sentenced to 70 years in 2009. He pleaded guilty to killing four people between 2003 and 2004, and his number of victims could be much higher, according to former FBI Special Agent Jonny Grusing.",
      "\"He made a game out of tricking the FBI,\" Grusing told Fox News Digital, adding that Kimball's case was unprecedented. \"As long as he won the game in front of him, that\u2019s all that mattered.\"",

      "\"To have someone who enjoyed manipulating us, putting stuff in our files, and then making people disappear was beyond anything I\u2019d seen,\" Grusing said.",
      "Kimball, now 58, was a known serial fraudster who spent time in and out of prison during his youth and early adulthood. In the 1990s, he practiced working the criminal justice system, becoming an informant for local police and blaming his own crimes on cellmates.",
      "After a 2001 arrest for check fraud in Alaska, he befriended his cellmate Steve Ennis, who had been charged in a drug case. To snake his way into a role as an FBI informant, a calculated Kimball convinced Ennis that he could make the drug case go away, and that he had powerful connections that could have witnesses \"taken care of.\" During the jail stint, he also befriended Ennis' girlfriend, a stripper named Jennifer Marcum.",
      "After planting the seeds of a murder-for-hire plot, Kimball reported to the FBI that Ennis was planning to have witnesses killed, and shortly thereafter, was granted confidential informant status. He was moved to a lower-security prison and eventually released.",

      "NEWLY RELEASED DOCUMENTS REVEAL IDAHO KILLER'S DISTURBING BEHAVIOR BEFORE CAMPUS MURDERS",
      "\"Our primary victim in our case was Jennifer Marcum,\" Grusing said. \"Mainly, he convinced Steve [Ennis] to hook him up with Jennifer to get Jennifer out of stripping. So, at the same time he's making Steve look like the bad guy, he's taking Jennifer and isolating her and killing her.\"",
      "By February 2003, Scott was a bona fide informant operating throughout the western United States, and Marcum was dead.",
      "During his several-year span as an informant, Kimball was responsible for killing four people, including Marcum. He would later confess to killing at least 21 people, and according to Grusing, told his own attorneys, he was responsible for 45 to 50 killings. His other alleged victims all remain unnamed.",
      "After his eventual arrest, authorities would learn that Scott killed LeAnn Emry, another stripper, whom he shot and left for dead in a remote desert area, just one month prior to Marcum's murder.",
      "In August of that year, Kayci Mcloed went missing. Her murder was eventually linked to Kimball, and he confessed to it.",
      "In 2004, Kimball killed his own uncle, Terry Kimball.",
      "In each case, the serial killer provided \"breadcrumbs\" to the FBI that ended up in the case files, including that he was the last person to be seen with two of the victims.",

      "\"And that's when two dads came to the FBI office to talk to my boss and say, not only was Scott responsible for Jennifer's disappearance, but another girl named Kayci was last with Scott, and that reporting was in the case file,\" said Grusing. \"But Scott had mastered such that, again, he enjoyed the game, and it was like leaving little breadcrumbs to say, 'I'm so good at this, I can tell you about these homicides, and you'll never know I'm doing them.'\"",
      "In March of 2006, Kimball was arrested in California on fraud-related charges.",
      "While he was in jail, the FBI built a case against him, and in 2009, he was officially charged with the murders.",
      "But the killer's manipulation of the FBI continued for years, as Grusing and others tried to get him to give up the locations of his victims' remains.",

      "\"We knew he was manipulating us, pointing us in different directions, but he's the only one who knew what happened to them,\" said Grusing. \"So even though it was painful to be in front of him and let him win all the time, as long as he thought he was squirming, he would always talk. So that's how I stayed with this man for 15 years.\"",
      "Eventually, McLeod and Emry's remains were recovered.",
      "At one point during Grusing's decade-and-a-half quest to get justice for more of Kimball's victims, the killer asked him why he had never been named like other serial killers.",
      "Grusing asked what name Kimball would give himself.",

    "summary": "Expert analyst Bill Roggio explains why China&apos;s growing influence with the Taliban makes President Donald Trump&apos;s plan to retake Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan unlikely to succeed.",
    "story": [
      "Senior Fellow Foundation for Defense of Democracies Bill Roggio says that China and the Taliban will never allow the US to retake Bagram Airbase despite comments from President Donald Trump",
      "President Donald Trump made the shocking announcement this month that the U.S. is \"trying\" to take back Bagram Airfield from the Taliban in Afghanistan after abandoning it more than four years ago.",
      "There\u2019s just one problem with Trump\u2019s latest ambition \u2014 China will see to it that Washington does not accomplish this goal, warned Bill Roggio, expert analyst and senior editor of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies\u2019 \"Long War Journal.\"",
      "\"First of all, the Taliban will never accept the return to the US. I'd sooner\u2026believe the Taliban would give up on its Sharia or Islamic law before I\u2019d believe that it would let the U.S. return,\" Roggio told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"But let's say the Trump administration could convince the Taliban to consider allowing the U.S. to return to Bagram,\" he continued. \"The Chinese would come down hard.\"",

      "Roggio explained that China and Russia have a vested interest in the U.S. staying out of the region.",
      "The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan opened the mineral-rich nation to China and has enabled Beijing to expand its Belt and Road Initiative into a country \u2014 though run by a terrorist organization \u2014 that it was previously unable to tap.",
      "China \u2014 the first country to appoint an ambassador to the Taliban-run nation in 2023 \u2014 sent its foreign minister, Wang Yi, in August to Kabul to hold talks with Afghanistan's acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi.",
      "According to the Taliban, China expressed an interest not only in Afghanistan\u2019s mining opportunities, where minerals like lithium, copper, iron, gold and uranium are abundant, but Beijing also said it was open to expand trade with Kabul.",

      "While access to these minerals could greatly benefit China, the impact that trade and mining agreements with Beijing could have on Afghanistan\u2019s dire economy may prove crucial for Kabul.",
      "\"The Chinese just wield significant influence with the Taliban, particularly when it comes to something like the U.S. return,\" Roggio said. \"They would pressure the Taliban by possibly canceling those mining rights, by restricting trade, by ending political and diplomatic recognition. These are all things that are important to the Taliban as they try to develop as a government and try to become legitimately recognized.\"",

      "\"The Taliban don't care if the U.S. recognizes them as much as the Taliban would care if the Chinese would recognize them, if the Russians would recognize them,\" he added.",
      "Trump claimed that the deal he formed with the Taliban in 2020 in Doha, Qatar \u2014 which outlined the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan by May 2021 \u2014 did not include the Bagram Air Base.",
      "\"We were going to keep it,\" Trump told reporters from the U.K. last week.",
      "But the original deal did not include a stipulation allowing the U.S. to maintain forces at the base about 30 miles north of Kabul.",

      "Trump also said a major reason he wants to get the base back is because it's \"an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.\" But when asked which facility he was referring to, neither the White House nor the Pentagon would confirm, and Fox News Digital could not locate a Chinese nuclear facility through open-source intelligence that close to Afghanistan\u2019s border.",
      "Regardless of whether there is a Chinese nuclear facility near the former American base in Afghanistan, Roggio warned that the economic ties Beijing and Kabul are establishing is \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"The growing Taliban-Chinese relationship is something we should worry about. The Chinese can give the Taliban access to technology \u2014 military technology,\" he said. \"They could give them the resources that they need.\"",
      "Roggio pointed out that a mining deal could put \"billions\" into the Taliban\u2019s pockets.",
      "\"Why is this important? Because al Qaeda and other terrorist groups are using Afghanistan as a base of operations,\" Roggio said, noting that al Qaeda is reported to be running training camps in 13 out of the nation\u2019s 34 provinces.",

    "story": [
      "'The Dave Rubin Show' host Dave Rubin discusses speculation surrounding President Donald Trump and Elon Musk at Charlie Kirk's memorial service on 'America Reports.'",
      "Elon Musk has once again entered the British political fray, this time promoting a new right-wing party, Advance UK, while criticizing the leader of the rapidly growing and influential Reform UK party, Nigel Farage.",
      "Musk recently posted on X: Go with @_AdvanceUK, Ben [Habib] and Tommy [Robinson] for the real change that\u2019s needed to save Britain!\" In another post, he said, \"Advance UK will actually drive change. Farage is weak sauce who will do nothing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, he addressed tens of thousands in London at the \"Unite the Kingdom\" rally organized by the controversial right-winger Tommy Robinson. The billionaire joined the march by video link and condemned the left as \"the party of murder.\"",
      "NIGEL FARAGE RESPONDS AFTER ELON MUSK DECLARES HE 'DOESN'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES' TO LEAD REFORM UK PARTY",
      "The billionaire also took aim at the man who could be Britain's next prime minister and claimed Nigel Farage \"doesn\u2019t have what it takes.\" That was before the birth of Advance UK. More recently, he said, \"There needs to be massive government reform in Britain and the people need to be in charge, not some bureaucracy that doesn\u2019t care.\"",
      "The right-leaning party, which is close to officially registering, is led by Ben Habib, a former co-deputy chairman of Reform UK. \"The two-party system is dead,\" Habib said. \"The Conservatives and Labour Party have had their chance, and now the people want something new.\"",
      "\"You clearly don\u2019t have a two-party system,\" said Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society think tank. However, he asked: \"Will this system produce a majority government and whether, for example, at the end of the process it delivers a main opposition party.\"",
      "Part of the fragmentation of British politics is the widespread disgust of political leaders. Prime Minister, Keir Starmer, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage all received unfavorable views between 52% and 68%, according to data from polling organization YouGov.",

      "Despite the negative view of Farage, Reform UK leads in the polls in the event of a general election, according to the polling company Ipsos. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean Reform will win at the next election.",
      "\"If there was an election tomorrow, then it would likely win,\" Mendoza says. However, we don\u2019t know when the next election will be, which makes it near impossible to predict at this stage, he says. \"The golden law of British politics is you can\u2019t predict the vote that far ahead.\"",
      "BRACE FOR A 'POLITICAL REVOLUTION' IN EUROPE, UK'S NIGEL FARAGE SAYS AFTER VANCE'S SPEECH IN MUNICH",
      "When asked why Advance UK is needed when Farage's party is far ahead in the polls, Habib said, \"Reform will not deliver. It stands for nothing. It is a populist party without a political philosophy and without intellectual heft or capability,\" Habib said, claiming \"Farage has a patriotic persona, but he is nothing more than a political expedient. He would be worse than [former Prime Minister] Boris Johnson.\"",
      "Nevertheless, it doesn\u2019t look like Advance U.K. will split the vote with Reform. According to Mendoza, bringing Robinson into the party may have been a mistake. During the recent rally, some protestors allegedly attacked police officers. \"Most people will not like violence at a political rally,\" he said. \"And they won\u2019t support the party.\"",
      "One of the leading frustrations voters have at the moment is that neither the current government nor the last one has managed to stop the surge of legal and illegal immigration. In fact, it has worsened. Almost 50,000 undocumented immigrants, many seeking asylum, arrived in Britain in the 12 months through June. That\u2019s up from around 39,000 at the same time the previous year, according to government data.",
      "On Saturday, the Daily Telegraph reported that migrants now account for 98% of the latest rise in population. According to the Office for National Statistics, the Telegraph reported, 69.3 million people were estimated to be living in the country in mid-2024, up 755,254 from the same time in 2023.",

      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also said borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum-seekers are living in hotels at taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million a day ($7.4 million).",
      "\"We need a holistic solution to reduce immigration,\" Habib said. He also agrees that borders must be enforced and illegal migrants deported. Worse still, those asylum seekers are living in hotels at the taxpayers\u2019 expense of \u00a35.8 million per day ($7.4 million).",
      "Earlier this summer, protests over asylum hotels erupted in Epping, southeast England. Separately, Farage suspended one of his local councilors over accusations of racism during the demonstration.",
      "Elon Musk responded to Farage's suspending the council member on X. He wrote: \"Farage is weak, runny sauce. He won\u2019t let Reform even stand up for their own people, e.g. punishing their Epping member, and he will change nothing of significance politically.\"",

Earlier this year, Irish comedian Graham Linehan was met by armed police at Heathrow Airport after making online comments about transgender people. Such incidents appear to be fast becoming the norm.",
      "Yet despite Musk's criticism, a new opinion poll released on Friday in the U.K. by YouGov showed Farage's Reform UK on target to deliver a massive defeat of Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his ruling Labour Party if an election were to be held.",

      "Tina Turner's fans seem to agree that a new statue of the late music legend is simply not the best.",
      "The 10-foot-tall bronze statue was unveiled Sept. 27 during the annual Tina Turner Heritage Days celebration in Turner's hometown of rural Brownsville, Tennessee. It depicts the \"What's Love Got to Do with It\" singer, who died in May 2023 at age 83, performing in a mini-skirt and heels while holding a microphone.",
      "Fred Ajanogha, the Atlanta-based sculptor who created the statue, reportedly paid extra attention to capturing the essence of Turner's hair, which he compared to the \u201cmane of a lion,\" according to the AP.",
      "But after the Brownsville Haywood County Chamber of Commerce shared a video on Facebook showing the moment the statue was uncovered near a museum honoring Turner at the West Tennessee Delta Heritage Center, fans began expressing disappointment.",
      "\"That statue should have been kicked down after the unveiling. That is a very poor replica of what is supposed to be The Iconic Tina Turner. So Disrespectful!\" one wrote beneath the video while another fan said whoever paid for the statue should \"get their money back.\"",
      "The statue also met with criticism on X, with one disappointed Turner fan calling it a \"tragedy,\" and writing, \"She deserves better.\"",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but the Tina Turner statue is hilarious. I can\u2019t look at it without laughing. And that\u2019s my girl, but why they do that to her hair?\" wrote someone else.",
      "Another music lover questioned how anyone could take the statue of Turner seriously. \"At this point Im convinced that these so-called sculptors are trolling us,\" the person wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, others who seemed to know something about art blamed the medium rather than the sculptor, like the person who posted side-by-side pics of the Turner statue next to a notorious 2009 statue of comedy legend Lucille Ball that was so hated, the sculptor ended up apologizing for it.",
      "\"Some bronze statues,\" the person reasoned, \"just don\u2019t turn out that well.\""

    "summary": "Robyn Brown and Kody Brown explains why he is reconsidering polygamy for reasons of sex.",
    "story": [
      "Robyn Brown has mourned the end of her plural marriage in recent seasons of \"Sister Wives\" and made it clear that she'd love to live a polygamous life once again.",
      "However, the reality star was taken aback when Kody Brown told her the one reason he'd consider adding another wife to their relationship in the Season 20 premiere.",
      "The scene took place when the couple was at a restaurant discussing the status of their marriage now that Kody Brown's relationships with Meri, Janelle and Christine Brown have ended.",
      "\"Do you see a value in (polygamy) for us and our future in any way?\" Kody Brown asked his wife.",
      "Robyn Brown said she'd be open to plural marriage again if they found someone who was \"really supportive\" and \"really wanted a relationship with me as well as with you.\"",
      "Kody Brown, on the other hand, wasn't so sure and said, \"I think you and I share something very special, but if it\u2019s not duplicatable, it could put us at risk.\"",
      "Roby Brown agreed that their relationship wasn't worth risking unless they had a \"guarantee\" that things would work out with another woman.",
      "Kody Brown then realized they weren't speaking the same language.",
      "\"No, not the guarantee. Why would we put that at risk for anything other than in my brain, there\u2019s something I want maybe more than you do,\" he said.",
      "Robyn Brown at first wasn't sure what her husband is talking about, but then realized he was referring to sex.",
      "\"My primary motivation, I\u2019m afraid at this state in my life, would be just how good looking she is. I\u2019m not kidding,\" he said.",
      "\"And that would be the very worst reason,\" she said.",
      "Robyn Brown then cautioned her husband that he doesn't know how he's \"coming across.\"",
      "\"I know. I\u2019m a guy and I don\u2019t freaking care,\" he said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Robyn Brown addressed her husband's blunt statement, saying, \"You\u2019re just kind of being a bit of a pig right now.\"",
      "In his own confessional, Kody Brown explained himself.",
      "\"I\u2019m being crass here for a reason. I\u2019m saying, 'Yeah, she looks hot. And that would make me want to talk to her. But I\u2019m not interested in marrying her because that won\u2019t matter when I\u2019m getting nagged,'\" he said.",
      "Robyn Brown definitely didn't see eye-to-eye with her husband on this one and explained why in her confessional.",
      "\"For me, I\u2019m like, OK, well so you have the real relationship with me, but then she\u2019s just, what, a concubine? Because that\u2019s pretty much what that is. It should be more than that, for sure. Most women want commitment. They want love, they want tenderness, they want companionship, they want honesty and depth and and emotional intimacy,\" she said.",
      "Kody Brown then addressed the top at further length in an interview.",
      "\"If I was to ever try this again, (the other woman) would have to be an absolute diamond. And I\u2019m not talking about just looks. ... Just take the sex out completely. She would have to adore Robyn so much that I would never, ever have to worry about whether she was competing with Robyn for my love and affection,\" he said."

      "A comedy festival in the capital of Saudi Arabia has become a cultural flash point as major comedians face criticism for accepting seemingly lucrative deals to perform in a country that was virtually impossible to visit until 2019 and a pariah in much of the West for its human rights record.",

      "The Saudi Embassy in Washington, D.C., declined to comment. Saudi Arabia\u2019s General Entertainment Authority, which announced the festival in July, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\u201cThe festival is the largest of its kind globally, bringing together a selection of award-winning comedy stars known for their outstanding performances on international stages and streaming platforms,\u201d the Saudi Press Agency wrote in its announcement for the General Entertainment Authority. \u201cIt reflects the efforts to amplify Riyadh\u2019s status as a leading destination for major cultural and artistic events.\u201d",
      "Saudi Arabia, the oil-rich home of Islam\u2019s two holiest sites, was for years among the most socially conservative nations on Earth with a morality police enforcing a strict interpretation of Shariah. In recent years under the rule of de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the country expanded its cultural and political influence by diversifying its economy and investing in sports, entertainment and tourism to improve its global image. Along with this, the crown prince oversaw a sweeping crackdown on dissent \u2014 imprisoning disgruntled royals, women\u2019s rights advocates, and reforming clerics as well as adherents to previously government-sanctioned proponents of strict Wahhabi Islam.",
      "Celebrities and influencers have often been criticized for performing in the country or participating in tourism campaigns, and FIFA drew condemnation last year for selecting Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup.",
      "Shane Gillis, who said he was offered an invite, claimed that the organizers \u201cdoubled the bag,\u201d or the amount of money offered, after he declined to participate.",

      "In a news release last week, Human Rights Watch wrote that the Saudi government is using the festival \u201cto deflect attention from its brutal repression of free speech and other pervasive human rights violations\u201d and called on the performers \u201cto publicly urge Saudi authorities to free unjustly detained Saudi dissidents, journalists, and human rights activists.\u201d",
      "The nonprofit watchdog organization noted that some of the events land on the seventh anniversary of the assassination of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, who was killed at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul by intelligence operatives with close ties to the crown prince. The festival also takes place just months after Saudi authorities executed Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.",
      "\u201cThe seventh anniversary of Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s brutal murder is no laughing matter,\u201d Joey Shea, Saudi Arabia researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cAnd comedians receiving hefty sums from Saudi authorities shouldn\u2019t be silent on prohibited topics in Saudi like human rights or free speech.\u201d",
      "Other listed performers for the festival include: Sebastian Maniscalco, Maz Jobrani, Tom Segura, Whitney Cummings, Jimeoin, Russell Peters, Andrew Santino, Bobby Lee, Chris Distefano, Mark Normand, Gabriel Iglesias, Hannibal Buress, Sam Morril, Jeff Ross, Omid Djalili, Ali Siddiq, Zarna Garg, Chris Tucker and Ben Hart.",

In the U.S., relatives of victims of the Sept. 11 terror attacks have accused the Saudi government of having potential ties to the attack. (A direct link has not been proven.)",
      "But it has also made significant inroads with some powerful figures in the West, most notably the Trump family. President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner worked with the Saudis to secure a $2 billion investment in his firm and recently partnered with the country\u2019s public investment fund to strike a $55 billion deal to take the video game giant Electronic Arts private.

      "At least one comedian, however, appears to have changed his mind despite initially agreeing to perform.

    "summary": "A new study has found the Amazon rainforest\u2019s biggest trees are growing because of the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.",
    "story": [
      "The giants of the Amazon are getting even bigger.",
      "A sweeping, new study has found the rainforest\u2019s largest trees are not only holding their ground, but they\u2019re thriving \u2014 growing, multiplying in number and continuing to play a major role in mitigating the impacts of climate change.",
      "There was a 3.3% expansion in big trees per decade, scientists found, after tracking changes in 188 intact forest plots across the Amazon over the past 30 years.",
      "Led by almost 100 researchers from 60 universities in Brazil, the U.K. and elsewhere, the findings were published Thursday in the journal Nature Plants.",
      "The authors attributed the growth to the rising amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from the burning of gas, oil and coal.",
      "The paper was welcomed as evidence of forest resilience in the face of climate change, but scientists warned these big trees remain vulnerable as droughts, lightning and fires are increasing in frequency, while deforestation continues to pose a serious threat.",
      "There was an understanding that big trees were \u201cexpected to be vulnerable to climate change,\u201d Adriane Esquivel-Muelbert, one of the study\u2019s lead authors, told NBC News in a telephone interview Saturday. \u201cWhat we see here is actually they seem to be showing quite a resilience.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not seeing signs of them dying off,\u201d said Esquivel-Muelbert, who co-authored the study while at Britain\u2019s University of Birmingham but has since moved to the nearby University of Cambridge. \u201cThey are increasing in size and number as well.\u201d",
      "Scientists stressed that while protecting intact forest areas was essential to stabilizing the climate, the Amazon cannot on its own offset the vast amount of carbon dioxide produced worldwide by cars, factories and power stations \u2014 and it remains under threat.",
      "The rainforest is a carbon sink, meaning it stores more carbon than it produces. Pushing the rainforest past its limit could accelerate climate change and have terrible consequences for local communities, including Indigenous groups who depend on it.",
      "Esquivel-Muelbert stressed it was difficult to predict how worsening climate change would have an impact in the future, and hesitated to say that increased CO2 benefited the forest, warning it may cause bigger trees to become more exposed to other factors like drought.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know the consequences in the long run,\u201d she said.",
      "Other factors, including deforestation, remain a colossal risk to the health of the Amazon.",
      "Fattening trees is, in some ways, a \u201cpositive news story,\u201d said Rebecca Banbury Morgan, a lead author of the study from the University of Bristol. But it also means that the forest is now \u201cmore vulnerable to losing those trees.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough we have shown that trees in intact forest are still increasing in size, any benefits of this in terms of the carbon sink can be quite easily negated by deforestation and logging impacts, so preserving these intact forests is really a priority,\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "Wildfires, deforestation and global warming could permanently destroy the water cycle that sustains parts of the Amazon rainforest if action is not taken in the coming decades, according to a separate study published last year in Nature.",
      "The study suggested that 10% to 47% of the landscape is at risk of transitioning away from rainforest by 2050 if warming and rates of deforestation aren\u2019t dramatically curbed.",
      "Brazil\u2019s Congress approved a bill in 2023 to relax environmental licensing to pave a highway cutting through the heart of the Amazon, and close to one of the last regions that still has large areas of pristine forest.",
      "Losing a large portion of the Amazon could turn a key carbon sink into a source of emissions, as wildfires burn and plants and animals decompose, no longer able to survive."

    "summary": "America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments this week.",
    "story": [
      "ABOARD THE USS GERALD R. FORD, The North Sea \u2014 America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, may be in an undisclosed location in the North Sea off the coast of Norway, but this week it is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments.",
      "With a series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO countries\u2019 airspace setting off alarm bells throughout Europe, the nuclear-powered carrier has been launching squadron after squadron of fighter jets as part of a multinational operation known as Neptune Strike.",
      "Two NATO officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive operational matters, told NBC News that the jets were taking off for assignments somewhere in Eastern Europe, where tensions have been high after a spate of Russian incursions.",
      "Nerves jangled further on Wednesday when German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told his country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, that Russia continued to test the line and overflew a German warship in recent days.",
      "A German military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Russian jets flew close to the frigate called Hamburg. He added that the ship, which is currently operating in the Baltic Sea, was taking part in Neptune Strike, among other things.",
      "The flyby came two days after NATO met to discuss Russia\u2019s recent violation of Estonian airspace with three MiG-31 fighter aircraft. The meeting was convened after Estonia requested consultations under Article 4, a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies.",
      "Earlier this month, there was also widespread anger after a number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have been at war for more than three and a half  years. A drone also reportedly entered Romanian airspace.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have been weighing a tougher response toward the Kremlin; NATO leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week condemned the Kremlin for a spate of \u201cescalatory\u201d incidents and vowed to defend the alliance.",
      "President Donald Trump also said Tuesday that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they enter their airspace as he met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pressed on whether the U.S. would back up NATO allies in such a situation, Trump said \u201cit depends on the circumstance.\u201d",
      "Heading to a summit with Putin in Alaska last month, Trump said he wanted a ceasefire. Since then, Moscow has expanded its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, while seemingly ignoring his overtures for further dialogue to end the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, out at sea, the level of military cooperation seems unimpeded by political currents, as the Ford takes part in Neptune Strike. NATO has said it is not a military exercise, instead calling it an \u201cenhanced vigilance activity.\u201d",
      "On the Ford, it was all-systems-go as squadron after squadron of F-18 fighter jets took off and landed within minutes of each other. The pace on the flight deck was frenetic aboard the nuclear-powered ship, which weighs around 100,000 tons and has a crew of between 4,500 and 4,700.",
      "No ship in the U.S. fleet can launch more jets faster. The dramatic thump of the ship\u2019s four electromagnetic catapults which shoot them into the sky is constant and can be heard throughout the ship.",
      "\u201cSeveral of those aircraft are going a long distance to drop live weapons on a close air support range that is to the northeast of here,\u201d the Ford carrier strike group commander, Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, said after a squadron took off.",
      "The purpose of the \u201cactivity\u201d is to demonstrate large-scale coordination in multiple theaters, NATO says. It has been run several times a year since it started in 2020.",
      "Lanzilotta also stressed that this week\u2019s maneuvers were not a response to recent events in Eastern Europe, but had been planned long in advance. This is part of the core message that NATO intends to send, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in an action-reaction mode,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO, as you know, is a defensive alliance and that is what we are doing. We\u2019re proving that out and showing it in the way that we planned months ago.\u201d",
      "Protected by Navy F-18 and Dutch air force F-35 fighter jets overhead and French and other Allied ships nearby, as well as launching planes quickly, the Ford can also land them within minutes of clearing the runway.",
      "As they come in to land, the 20-ton jets hook onto a series of wires on the aft end of the deck, before they are quickly moved out of the way by tow trucks and other machinery as another one sets down.",
      "Teams in green, yellow and white vests scurry around orchestrating the operation, which can be extremely dangerous with so much hardware around.",
      "At a briefing, a model of a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet hung behind Capt. David Dartez, commander of the Ford\u2019s air wing. Asked if that meant Russia was on their minds, he said they trained for any possible adversary.",
      "He also said he had conducted flights as far as Finland, which shares an 800-mile border with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fuel-dependent, but we have lots of friendly allies,\u201d he said, adding that he had refueled from a Finnish aircraft while on NATO maneuvers.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t say where I was, but he gave me gas because I was very far away from the aircraft carrier\u2026 at that moment, over 1,000 miles,\u201d he said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled a comprehensive peace proposal to end the war in Gaza, nearly two years after Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel.",
      "During his visit with Trump at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly backed the 20-point plan, but Trump acknowledged that Hamas had not agreed to it.",
      "The key components of the proposal include the release of all living and dead hostages in Gaza, a requirement for Hamas to lay down its arms, a withdrawal of Israeli troops from the territory, the delivery of humanitarian aid and the installation of a civilian governing authority for Palestinians.",
      "Trump said that if Hamas rejects the deal, he would back Netanyahu in dismantling and destroying Hamas.",
      "Here is the full text of the plan:",
      "Gaza will be a deradicalized terror-free zone that does not pose a threat to its neighbors.",
      "Gaza will be redeveloped for the benefit of the people of Gaza, who have suffered more than enough.",
      "If both sides agree to this proposal, the war will immediately end. Israeli forces will withdraw to the agreed upon line to prepare for a hostage release. During this time, all military operations, including aerial and artillery bombardment, will be suspended, and battle lines will remain frozen until conditions are met for the complete staged withdrawal.",
      "Within 72 hours of Israel publicly accepting this agreement, all hostages, alive and deceased, will be returned.",
      "Once all hostages are released, Israel will release 250 life sentence prisoners plus 1700 Gazans who were detained after October 7th 2023, including all women and children detained in that context. For every Israeli hostage whose remains are released, Israel will release the remains of 15 deceased Gazans.",
      "Once all hostages are returned, Hamas members who commit to peaceful co-existence and to decommission their weapons will be given amnesty. Members of Hamas who wish to leave Gaza will be provided safe passage to receiving countries.",
      "Upon acceptance of this agreement, full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip. At a minimum, aid quantities will be consistent with what was included in the January 19, 2025, agreement regarding humanitarian aid, including rehabilitation of infrastructure (water, electricity, sewage), rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries, and entry of necessary equipment to remove rubble and open roads.",
      "Entry of distribution and aid in the Gaza Strip will proceed without interference from the two parties through the United Nations and its agencies, and the Red Crescent, in addition to other international institutions not associated in any manner with either party. Opening the Rafah crossing in both directions will be subject to the same mechanism implemented under the January 19, 2025 agreement.",
      "Gaza will be governed under the temporary transitional governance of a technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee, responsible for delivering the day-to-day running of public services and municipalities for the people in Gaza. This committee will be made up of qualified Palestinians and international experts, with oversight and supervision by a new international transitional body, the \u201cBoard of Peace,\u201d which will be headed and chaired by President Donald J. Trump, with other members and heads of State to be announced, including Former Prime Minister Tony Blair. This body will set the framework and handle the funding for the redevelopment of Gaza until such time as the Palestinian Authority has completed its reform program, as outlined in various proposals, including President Trump\u2019s peace plan in 2020 and the Saudi-French proposal, and can securely and effectively take back control of Gaza. This body will call on best international standards to create modern and efficient governance that serves the people of Gaza and is conducive to attracting investment.",
      "A Trump economic development plan to rebuild and energize Gaza will be created by convening a panel of experts who have helped birth some of the thriving modern miracle cities in the Middle East. Many thoughtful investment proposals and exciting development ideas have been crafted by well-meaning international groups, and will be considered to synthesize the security and governance frameworks to attract and facilitate these investments that will create jobs, opportunity, and hope for future Gaza.",
      "A special economic zone will be established with preferred tariff and access rates to be negotiated with participating countries.",
      "No one will be forced to leave Gaza, and those who wish to leave will be free to do so and free to return. We will encourage people to stay and offer them the opportunity to build a better Gaza.",
      "Hamas and other factions agree to not have any role in the governance of Gaza, directly, indirectly, or in any form. All military, terror, and offensive infrastructure, including tunnels and weapon production facilities, will be destroyed and not rebuilt. There will be a process of demilitarization of Gaza under the supervision of independent monitors, which will include placing weapons permanently beyond use through an agreed process of decommissioning, and supported by an internationally funded buy back and reintegration program all verified by the independent monitors. New Gaza will be fully committed to building a prosperous economy and to peaceful coexistence with their neighbors.",
      "A guarantee will be provided by regional partners to ensure that Hamas, and the factions, comply with their obligations and that New Gaza poses no threat to its neighbors or its people.",
      "The United States will work with Arab and international partners to develop a temporary International Stabilization Force (ISF) to immediately deploy in Gaza. The ISF will train and provide support to vetted Palestinian police forces in Gaza, and will consult with Jordan and Egypt who have extensive experience in this field. This force will be the long-term internal security solution. The ISF will work with Israel and Egypt to help secure border areas, along with newly trained Palestinian police forces. It is critical to prevent munitions from entering Gaza and to facilitate the rapid and secure flow of goods to rebuild and revitalize Gaza. A deconfliction mechanism will be agreed upon by the parties.",
      "Israel will not occupy or annex Gaza. As the ISF establishes control and stability, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will withdraw based on standards, milestones, and timeframes linked to demilitarization that will be agreed upon between the IDF, ISF, the guarantors, and the Unites States, with the objective of a secure Gaza that no longer poses a threat to Israel, Egypt, or its citizens. Practically, the IDF will progressively hand over the Gaza territory it occupies to the ISF according to an agreement they will make with the transitional authority until they are withdrawn completely from Gaza, save for a security perimeter presence that will remain until Gaza is properly secure from any resurgent terror threat.",
      "In the event Hamas delays or rejects this proposal, the above, including the scaled-up aid operation, will proceed in the terror-free areas handed over from the IDF to the ISF.",
      "An interfaith dialogue process will be established based on the values of tolerance and peaceful co-existence to try and change mindsets and narratives of Palestinians and Israelis by emphasizing the benefits that can be derived from peace.",
      "While Gaza re-development advances and when the PA reform program is faithfully carried out, the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood, which we recognize as the aspiration of the Palestinian people.",
      "The United States will establish a dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians to agree on a political horizon for peaceful and prosperous co-existence."

      "\u201cIntense negotiations have been going on for four days, and will continue for as long as necessary in order to get a Successfully Completed Agreement,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social, calling the discussions \u201cvery inspired and productive.\u201d",
      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post, he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",
      "Negotiations for either a complete end to the fighting or a temporary ceasefire and hostage exchange have previously stalled as both Israel and Hamas have accused the other of reneging on promises, changing details and rejecting deals accepted by the other.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who faced a mass walkout as he spoke at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Friday, has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas has been disarmed, and to maintain lasting security control over Gaza.",
      "After dozens of diplomats left the room, Netanyahu reiterated his intention to \u201cfinish the job\u201d against Hamas in Gaza, in a combative speech that also saw him attack the recognition of a Palestinian state by multiple Western countries.",
      "Israel and the U.S. have both said that the move risks rewarding  Hamas, which carried out the deadliest attack in Israeli history on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 hostages were taken into Gaza, according to Israel.",
      "Israel has killed more than 65,000 people in Gaza over the past 23 months, according to health officials in the enclave. It has also destroyed vast areas of the strip, displaced around 90% of the population and caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in exchange for a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal.",
      "Trump said Friday that the militant group was \u201cvery much aware of these discussions, and Israel has been informed at all levels,\u201d including Netanyahu. \u201cThere is more Goodwill and Enthusiasm for getting a Deal done, after so many decades, than I have ever seen before,\u201d he added.",
      "Trump presented proposals to Arab nations on Monday \u2014 including Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt \u2014 during a meeting held on the sidelines of the annual General Assembly, according to his special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "Netanyahu, meanwhile, met with the foreign minister for the United Arab Emirates in New York on Friday. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan stressed an urgent need to end the war in Gaza and to reach a permanent and sustainable ceasefire, his office said.",
      "Bin Zayed also reiterated support for efforts to achieve a two-state solution in the region, at the same time as Israel pushes ahead with a widely condemned settlement plan that would effectively split the West Bank in two, further fracturing what Palestinians envision as their future state.",
      "UAE leaders have previously said annexation of the West Bank would be a red line for the influential Gulf state, blocking any future recognition of Israel and preventing the completion of Trump\u2019s landmark Abraham Accords that sought to establish diplomatic normalization between Israel and several Arab states including the UAE.",
      "Trump said Thursday that he would not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "In September, Israel launched a widely condemned ground offensive into Gaza City, the enclave\u2019s most populous area, driving out hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom had previously been displaced on multiple occasions.",
      "Doctors Without Borders said Friday that it had been forced to leave the city in northern Gaza. \u201cWe have been left with no choice but to stop our activities, as our clinics are encircled by Israeli forces,\u201d it said on X.",
      "Israeli strikes and gunfire killed at least 40 people across Gaza on Saturday, including 23 from Gaza City, Dr. Khalil Al-Daqran, a spokesperson for Gaza\u2019s Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The spiraling conflict in the Middle East has been a focal point of the General Assembly this week. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas addressed the gathering Thursday, albeit by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",

      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",

      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war. We  will never be starting any wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut whomever attacks us, we will do our utmost to give them the strongest answer. We will certainly augment our capabilities on a daily basis so as to prevent anyone from attacking us,\u201d Pezeshkian added.",
      "Injury during an airstrike",
      "Pezeshkian, who practiced as a doctor before entering politics, addressed an injury he sustained during the 12-day war with Israel in June, during which senior military leaders, scientists and hundreds of Iranian civilians were killed. Twenty-eight Israelis died during the conflict.",
      "\u201cThey hit us because they were seeking to martyr us like everyone else. We are not afraid of death and martyrdom. We have lived our lives. I have lived my life,\u201d he said.",

      "Britain\u2019s The Sun newspaper claimed last week that Harry\u2019s first meeting with the king in two years was \u201cdistinctly formal,\u201d claiming the prince had expressed feeling more like an \u201cofficial visitor\u201d than a son.",
      "Harry\u2019s camp rejected that outright.",
      "\u201cRecent reporting of The Duke\u2019s view of the tone of the meeting, is categorically false,\u201d a spokesperson told NBC News, referring to Harry\u2019s title, Duke of Sussex. \u201cThe quotes attributed to him are pure invention fed, one can only assume, by sources intent on sabotaging any reconciliation between father and son.\u201d",
      "The public feud over the meeting has only deepened tensions at a moment when the family is seeking to project unity, and it could set back attempts to mend the relationship, according to NBC News royal commentator Daisy McAndrew.",
      "\u201cI think the king will be really disappointed,\u201d she said.",
      "Harry had earlier sounded eager to build on the brief tea, emphasizing his desire to spend more time with his father while defending his tell-all memoir in an interview with Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper following that trip to the U.K.",
      "The accusations from Harry\u2019s camp came just a week after the family showcased its finest pomp and pageantry during Trump\u2019s state visit \u2014 a triumph quickly overshadowed by a return to all-too-familiar controversy.",
      "While Trump\u2019s trip was only briefly marred by the Epstein scandal, the subject was soon back on newspaper front pages with new royal revelations.",
      "The king has instructed Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, that they will not be welcome at the royal Christmas, according to weekend reports in Britain\u2019s Telegraph and Sunday Times newspapers that cited multiple sources.",
      "Buckingham Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the report and on the statement from Harry\u2019s spokesperson.",
      "That comes after Ferguson was dropped as a patron by a number of charities following a newly surfaced email that revealed she had referred to Epstein as a \u201csupreme friend,\u201d despite the disgraced financier\u2019s conviction on sex offenses. A spokesperson for the duchess said the email was sent to counter a threat Epstein had made to sue her and accuse her of defamation.",
      "The disclosure reignited scrutiny of royal ties to Epstein, long centered on Andrew.",

      "\u201cThe problem with Andrew is he\u2019s always grabbing the attention back,\u201d she said.",

      "William, the heir to the throne, added: \u201cLife is said to test us as well, and being able to overcome that is what makes us who we are.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK \u2014 The United States clashed with world leaders over artificial intelligence at the United Nations General Assembly this week, rejecting calls for global oversight as many pushed for new collaborative frameworks.",
      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, said that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",

      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",

      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

      "Pezeshkian spoke with \u201cNBC Nightly News with Tom Llamas\u201d during a trip to New York for the United Nations General Assembly. His comments came after Trump said in his U.N. speech on Tuesday that U.S. attacks in June had hit \u201cIran\u2019s key nuclear facility, totally obliterating everything.\u201d",

      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war\u2026will never be starting any wars.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe can just say that it was a hematoma formed in the region of the knee. We dropped the needed liquid and blood, and after that, we got over it,\u201d he added.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Llamas asked about a Washington Post report based on a review of satellite imagery and independent analysis indicating increased work at an underground site in Iran that analysts say could be a potential future nuclear facility, and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility.  Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA, they can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hardline parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council will vote on a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions. But despite this, and the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, it appeared that the penalties would be reimposed after the Saturday deadline."
