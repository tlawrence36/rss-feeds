      "The 2025 Grammy Award nominations are here",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Welcome toBeyonc\u00e9 country. When it comes to the 2025 Grammy Award nominations, \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d rules the nation. She leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to 99 nominations. That makes her the most nominated artist in Grammy history.",
      "\u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is up for album and country album of the year, and \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d is nominated for record, song and country song of the year. She also received nominations in a wide swath of genres, including pop, country, Americana and melodic rap performance categories.",
      "This is her first time receiving nominations in the country and Americana categories. Previously, she and her husband Jay-Z were tied for most career nominations, at 88.",
      "If Beyonc\u00e9 wins the album of the year, she\u2019ll become the first Black woman to do so in the 21st century. Lauryn Hill last won in 1999 for \u201cThe Miseducation of Lauryn Hill,\u201d joining Natalie Cole and Whitney Houston as the only Black women to take home the Grammys\u2019 top prize.",
      "Post Malone also received his first ever nominations in the country categories this year, having released his debut country album \u201cF-1 Trillion\" in August. That one is up for country album and \u201cI Had Some Help,\u201d his collaboration with Morgan Wallen, is nominated for country song and country duo/group performance. They are Wallen\u2019s first ever Grammy nominations.",
      "Malone is just behind Beyonc\u00e9, with seven nominations, tied with Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Charli XCX, who earned her first nominations as a solo artist.",
      "Lamar\u2019s ubiquitous diss track released during his feud with Drake, \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d is nominated for record and song of the year, rap song, music video as well as best rap performance. He has two simultaneous entries in the latter category, a career first: Future & Metro Boomin featuring Lamar, \u201cLike That\u201d is up for best rap performance and best rap song.",
      "This is his third time receiving two simultaneous nominations for best rap song.",
      "Taylor Swift and first-time nominees Sabrina Carpenter and Chappell Roan boast of six nominations each.",
      "Last year, women artists dominated the major categories. This year, that continues somewhat, but the main trend seems to be a variance of genre. In the album of the year category, alongside \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d is Andr\u00e9 3000\u2019s new age, alt-jazz \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d and multi-instrumentalist Jacob Collier\u2019s \u201cDjesse Vol. 4.\u201d Rising pop stars Carpenter and Roan round it out, with \u201cShort n\u2019 Sweet\u201d and \u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess\u201d respectively, as well as Swift\u2019s \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cHit Me Hard and Soft,\u201d and Charli XCX\u2019s rave-ready \u201cBRAT.\u201d",
      "Eilish is the only artist to have her first three albums become nominated for album of the year.",
      "Last year, Swift won album of the year for \u201cMidnights,\u201d breaking the record for most wins in the category with four. This year, she becomes the first ever woman to seven career nominations in the category.",
      "\u201cThe breadth and the variety of genres represented in the general field feels new and really exciting,\u201d says the Recording Academy CEO and President Harvey Mason jr. He credits an active and evolving voting body for its success. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very intentional in how we looked at and tried to rebalance our membership. So not just gender or people of color, different racial makeup, but also genre equity and trying to make sure that all different types of music in different regions and different locations are being represented in every way possible.\u201d",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Sept. 16, 2023 through Aug. 30, 2024 were eligible for nominations. The final round of Grammy voting, which determines its winners, will take place Dec. 12 through January 3.",
      "In the best new artist category, Carpenter and Roan will go head-to-head, alongside Benson Boone, Doechii, Khruangbin, RAYE, Shaboozey and Teddy Swims.",
      "In the song of the year category, Beyonc\u00e9 is joined by Eilish with \u201cBirds of a Feather,\u201d Swift and Post Malone with \u201cFortnight,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cPlease Please Please,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Lady Gaga and Bruno Mars\u2019 \u201cDie With A Smile,\u201d and Shaboozey\u2019s \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy).\u201d",
      "Shaboozey is also a first-time nominee. His \u201cA Bar Song (Tipsy)\u201d is the biggest song of the year, having spent more weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 than any other \u2014 it is so popular, a remix of the track is also up for remixed recording.",
      "Elsewhere, Shaboozey is nominated in the melodic rap performance category for his feature on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially-successful Black woman musician in country, is also featured on the song, delivering the 83-year-old artist her first Grammy nomination.",
      "For record of the year, \u201cTexas Hold \u2019Em\u201d will compete against Swift and Post Malone\u2019s \u201cFortnight,\u201d Eilish\u2019s \u201cBirds of a Father,\u201d Lamar\u2019s \u201cNot Like Us,\u201d Roan\u2019s \u201cGood Luck, Babe!\u201d, Carpenter\u2019s \u201cEspresso,\u201d Charli XCX\u2019s \u201c360,\u201d and the Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re trying to make sure we\u2019re keeping up with how music creators and our community are using technology. And in this case, AI enhanced the record and allowed it to be eligible in the categories that it was eligible in,\u201d Mason jr explains.",
      "Dolly Parton scored her 55th career nomination in the audio book, narration, and storytelling recording category for her \u201cBehind the Seams: My Life in Rhinestones,\u201d news The Associated Press broke to the country music legend Friday morning. \u201cNo! What did I get nominated for?\u201d she cheered over the phone. \"Oh, well, that's cool. I thought it would be for my rock album, I'd take it.",
      "\u201cIt feels good. I\u2019m always appreciative of everything. I don\u2019t work for that, but it\u2019s always good to say \u2018you\u2019ve done good work,' and for somebody to acknowledge that. So, I\u2019m always proud of every award I get and every mention I get. That just makes me feel like I\u2019m doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "She's up against producer Guy Oldfield, George Clinton, Barbra Streisand and Jimmy Carter, who could become the oldest Grammy award winner in history at 100.",
      "So, what\u2019s missing? Like last year, there\u2019s a huge dearth of Latin music \u2014 the fastest growing streaming genre in the United States \u2014 across the board, and no representation in the major categories. There are also only four entries in the best M\u00fasica Mexicana album category, despite it also being one of the fastest growing genres.",
      "And K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across their career.",
      "\u201cI definitely see room for improvement across many genres and we are continuing to invite people to be a part of the academy,\u201d Mason jr. says. \u201cWithout the right representation we don\u2019t get the right results. When I say right, I mean reflective and representative of what\u2019s happening in music today. So, the work continues.\u201d",
      "The 2025 Grammy Awards will air Feb. 2 live on CBS and Paramount+ from the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles."

      "It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show",
      "NEW YORK -- It looks like the 2025 Grammy Awards may be a different kind of award show. Beyonc\u00e9 leads the nods with 11, bringing her career total to a record-breaking 99 nominations. There's an incredible diversity of genres represented across the major categories, and women continue to succeed. So... who didn\u2019t make the cut? What were the best surprises of all? Let\u2019s take a look.",
      "Country music has bled into other prominent genres and the Recording Academy has taken note. Country hybridists \u2014 like Beyonc\u00e9, Post Malone and first-time nominee Shaboozey \u2014 lead many nominations, in country and beyond.",
      "But that means the traditionalists might not see rewards: CMA Awards favorites Cody Johnson\u2019s \u201cLeather\u201d and Luke Combs\u2019 \u201cFathers & Sons\u201d didn\u2019t see any nominations. The latter shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise: Comb\u2019s blockbuster cover of Tracy Chapman\u2019s \u201cFast Car\u201d wasn\u2019t nominated for record of the year at the Grammys in 2024, either \u2013 though it did land a nod in best country solo performance.",
      "This year also marks Malone and Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s first-ever nominations in the country categories.",
      "Who saw this one coming? The Beatles last new song, the AI-assisted \u201cNow and Then,\" is up for record of the year. Released in 2023, the song utilized artificial intelligence to extract John Lennon\u2019s voice from an old demo. It's the same technology used to separate the Beatles\u2019 voices from background sounds during the making of director Peter Jackson\u2019s 2021 documentary series, \u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\u201d",
      "Last summer, the Recording Academy announced a series of changes to the Grammy Awards, including new protocols involving technological advancements in machine learning. It sparked headlines: \u201cOnly human creators\u201d could win the music industry\u2019s highest honor in a decision aimed at the use of artificial intelligence in popular music. At the 2025 Grammys, clearly, those changes are in action.",
      "Last year's album of the year category was dominated by pop women \u2014 and that continues, with Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Charli XCX's rave-ready approach to the genre receiving noms. The latter is a nice surprise (more on that below), but the two men nominated are creative outliers. OutKast frontman Andr\u00e9 3000's experimental jazz-flute album \u201cNew Blue Sun\u201d is a contender, as well as Jacob Collier's \u201cDjesse Vol. 4,\u201d though that one may fulfill a space left vacant by Jon Batiste.",
      "Charli XCX, having never received a solo artist nomination at the Grammys, is up for seven awards at the 2025 ceremony. Those include record and album of the year, as well as pop solo and pop duo/group performance, pop dance recording, dance/electronic album and music video. Clearly, her culture-shifting \u201cBRAT\u201d album \u2014 and the summer of memes it inspired \u2014 has continued to hold real influence.",
      "There is no shortage of first-time nominees this year. Some were expected \u2014 like Roan, Carpenter and Shaboozey \u2014 others less so. Willow Smith has received her first nomination in the arrangement, instruments and vocals category for arranging her song \u201cb i g f e e l i n g s.\u201d Linda Martell, the first commercially successful Black woman musician in country, is featured alongside Shaboozey on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cSPAGHETTII,\" which is up for the melodic rap performance category. That delivers the progenitor her first-ever Grammy nomination at age 83.",
      "And lastly, Morgan Wallen \u2014 undoubtedly one of the most popular musicians in the country, and one rife with controversy \u2014 has received his first two Grammy nominations for his feature on Malone's \u201cI Had Some Help.\u201d Last year, his song \u201cLast Night\u201d was nominated for best country song, but that is a songwriter\u2019s award, and Wallen did not receive a nod.",
      "In the past, the country singer has been absent from nominations. In 2021, after video surfaced of him using a racial slur, he was disqualified or limited from several award shows and received no Grammy nominations for his bestselling \u201cDangerous: The Double Album.\u201d",
      "Just like last year, Latin music is missing from the top categories at the 2025 Grammys, despite a surplus of eligible talent: Peso Pluma\u2019s \u201c\u00c9xodo,\" Shakira\u2019s \u201cLas Mujeres Ya No Lloran,\u201d Residente, \u201cLas Letras Ya No Importan,\" Car\u00edn Le\u00f3n's \u201cBoca Chueca, Vol. 1\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d among them.",
      "Same as above: K-pop, too, seems to be absent. There are no nominations for the BTS members who\u2019ve released solo material this year: RM\u2019s \u201cRight Place, Wrong Person,\u201d J-Hope\u2019s \u201cHope on the Street, Vol. 1,\u201d and Jimin\u2019s \u201cMuse.\u201d As a boy band, BTS has received five nominations across its career.",
      "Despite being one of the great global superstars of the current moment \u2014 regularly celebrated as one of the most streamed artists on the planet \u2014 Bad Bunny's \u201cNadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Ma\u00f1ana\u201d received only one nomination, for m\u00fasica urbana album.",
      "And Usher, who had a blockbuster year \u2014 including a star-studded Super Bowl halftime show \u2014 also received only one nomination, for R&B album.",
      "In pop, Dua Lipa's \u201cEternal Optimism\" is nowhere to be seen. In country, best new artist hopeful Megan Moroney received no nominations. In R&B, Normani's long-awaited debut album, \u201cDopamine,\u201d failed to make waves with voters, and in rap, Nicki Minaj's \u201cPink Friday 2\u201d and Megan Thee Stallion's \u201cMegan\u201d are absent.",
      "Last year, Jack Antonoff took home producer of the year, non-classical for a third year in a row, tying Babyface as the only other producer to do so consecutively. This year, he didn't receive a nod in that category \u2014 one he has held a place in since 2019. Who will take the mantle?",

      "LONDON -- A father and daughter crippled by a suicide bomber who killed 22 people after an Ariana Grande concert in England in 2017 were awarded 45,000 pounds ($58,000) Friday in a case against a former television producer who claimed the tragedy was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert and his daughter, Eve, won their harassment suit in the High Court in London last month against Richard Hall for videos, a film and a book he produced that falsely claim the Manchester Arena bombing was staged using actors and no one was wounded or killed.",
      "Hall, an independent producer, had claimed \u201cmillions of people have bought a lie\u201d about the attack and defended his work, including surreptitiously filming the daughter, as journalism in the public's interest.",
      "Justice Karen Steyn called Hall\u2019s conduct a \u201cnegligent, indeed reckless, abuse of media freedom.\" She said he used the \u201cflimsiest of analytical techniques\u201d to dismiss \"the obvious, tragic reality to which so many ordinary people have attested.\u201d",
      "Salman Abedi blew himself up with a bomb hidden in a knapsack as fans were leaving the Grande concert on May 22, 2017. In addition to those killed, more than 260 people were wounded and hundreds of others were left with \u201cdeep psychological injuries,\u201d police said.",
      "Martin Hibbert was paralyzed from the waist down and his daughter, who was 14 at the time, nearly died and has severe brain damage.",
      "The Hibbert's also won an injunction preventing Hall from further harassment, and Hall will have to pay 90% of their legal costs that are currently estimated at 260,000 pounds ($335,000).",
      "The award, however, is meager compared to many won in U.S. lawsuits. In a case that also involved denying a major tragedy, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was ordered to pay $1.5 billion to parents of children killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut in 2012 for falsely claiming it was a hoax.",
      "Martin Hibbert said that he never expects to see a penny of the award, but the victory wasn't about money.",
      "\u201cWhat this was about was bringing him down in public, in front of his own followers, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done,\" he said outside court.",
      "Hall said the trial was unfair and continued to insist the bombing didn't happen as he left the court."

      "Lawyers for Combs filed the request in Manhattan federal court, where his previous requests for bail have been rejected by two judges since his September arrest on racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he coerced and abused women for years with help from a network of associates and employees, while silencing victims through blackmail and violence, including kidnapping, arson and physical beatings.",

      "In their new court filing, lawyers for Combs say they are proposing a \u201cfar more robust\u201d bail package that would subject the entertainer to strict around-the-clock security monitoring and near-total restrictions on his ability to contact anyone but his lawyers. But the amount of money they attach to the package remains $50 million, as they proposed before.",
      "They also cite new evidence that they say \u201cmakes clear that the government's case is thin.\u201d That evidence, the lawyers said, refutes the government's claim that a March 2016 video showing Combs physically assaulting his then-girlfriend occurred during a coerced \u201cfreak off,\u201d a sexually driven event described in the indictment against Combs.",
      "They wrote that the encounter was instead \u201ca minutes-long glimpse into a complex but decade-long consensual relationship\u201d between Combs and his then-girlfriend.",
      "The lawyers argued that the jail conditions Combs is experiencing at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn violate his constitutional rights to participate in his defense.",

      "The U.S. exhibit showcases seven African American artists whose works examine the past, present and future repercussions of slavery. It's part of the international festival held every other year and known as Dak\u2019Art.",

      "The exhibition, founded in 1989 by the Senegalese government to promote the continent's thriving art scene, has over the years become one of the most important among African artists.",
      "This year's theme, \u201cThe Wake,\u201d has 58 artists from 33 countries exploring various meanings and evocations of the term, such as exhumation, mourning and uprooting, according to the organizers.",
      "The central idea behind it is to link the past and the future by giving them equal importance, Salimata Diop, Dak\u2019Art\u2019s artistic director said in a statement distributed to the media.",
      "The United States was the guest of honor of this year\u2019s show.",
      "The work of African American artists explored cultural beliefs about the afterlife held by Lebou, one of Senegal's ethnic groups. The Lebou believe that in the afterlife, spirits dwell eternally in the ocean.",
      "There was also an entire new alphabet depicted on the curly hair pattern of African hair, as well as an immersive exhibit attempting to let viewers experience what it might have felt like to be a slave and be thrown into the water.",
      "The wake of slavery impacted all Americans, said Diana Baird N\u2019Diaye, the show's curator. She is based between the U.S. and Senegal. The displayed art does not only relate to the past, but also looks towards the future, she added.",

      "The Dak'Art comes as several countries in the region are stepping away from traditional Western allies and turning towards new partners, such as Russia and China, with a less complicated history in the region.",
      "In a region rocked in recent years by coups and extremist violence, Senegal has managed to maintain its reputation as a stable democracy. Still, Senegal's ruling party, which is facing an election next week, has pledged to review its relationship with Western countries, but so far has not made any radical decisions.",
      "Khady Di\u00e8ne Gaye, Senegal's minister of youth, sports and culture, told reporters that the U.S. role as the guest of honor is \u201ca display of the importance of art as a tool for dialogue between peoples, the promotion of peace, mutual understanding, but most importantly as a tool for economic and social development.\u201d",
      "The Dak\u2019Art runs until Dec. 7. Originally scheduled for May, it was postponed following political tensions around the April presidential election and funding issues that the new authorities blamed on the former administration."

      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d",
      "An heirloom piano takes on immense significance for one family in 1936 Pittsburgh in August Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Piano Lesson.\u201d Generational ties also permeate the film adaptation, in which Malcolm Washington follows in his father Denzel Washington\u2019s footsteps in helping to bring the entirety of The Pittsburgh Cycle \u2014 a series of 10 plays \u2014 to the screen.",
      "Malcolm Washington did not start from scratch in his accomplished feature filmmaking debut. He enlisted much of the cast from the recent Broadway revival with Samuel L. Jackson (Doaker Charles), his brother, John David Washington (Boy Willie), Ray Fisher (Lymon) and Michael Potts (Whining Boy). Berniece, played by Danielle Brooks in the play, is now beautifully portrayed by Danielle Deadwyler. With such rich material and a cast for whom it\u2019s second nature, it would be hard, one imagines, to go wrong. Jackson\u2019s own history with the play goes back to its original run in 1987 when he was Boy Willie.",
      "It\u2019s not the simplest thing to make a play feel cinematic, but Malcolm Washington was up to the task. His film opens up the world of the Charles family beyond the living room. In fact, this adaptation, which Washington co-wrote with \u201cMudbound\u201d screenwriter Virgil Williams, goes beyond Wilson\u2019s text and shows us the past and the origins of the intricately engraved piano that\u2019s central to all the fuss. It even opens on a big, action-filled set piece in 1911, during which the piano is stolen from a white family\u2019s home. Another fleshes out Doaker's monologue in which he explains to the uninitiated, Fisher\u2019s Lymon, and the audience, the tortured history of the thing. While it might have been nice to keep the camera on Jackson, such a great, grounding presence throughout, the good news is that he really makes narration shine as well.",
      "Wilson purists will certainly have opinions on these artistic choices; But they let the film breathe a bit, offering some respite from the living room with the looming piano. And most of the film stays right there, in 1936. Boy Willie and Lymon descend early one morning, uninvited, on the Pittsburgh home of Berniece and her uncle Doaker. It\u2019s a family reunion with an agenda: They\u2019ve driven a truck full of watermelons up north from Mississippi, and Willie, Berniece\u2019s younger brother, wants to sell the watermelons and then the piano. The dusty old instrument represents to him a chance to let the past go and start a future. With the money, he wants to buy the land that his enslaved ancestors worked. Berniece has other ideas about the piano, namely keeping it. It\u2019s a connection to the past, not an anchor. Besides, it might be haunted.",
      "Yes, \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d in theaters Friday and streaming on Netflix on Nov. 22, isn\u2019t just a meditation on family history. It\u2019s also a literal ghost story, with creaks, spooks and shadows lurking when the piano is disturbed. Deadwyler is electric as Berniece, who bears the brunt of the haunting, walking on eggshells in her life, trying to care for her young daughter and fend off passes from men who assume she can only be fulfilled with one at her side. Now she must deal with her somewhat manic brother who might, Doaker wisely reminds, actually, annoyingly, have a point. Perhaps the film academy will make up for their snub of her performance in \u201cTill\u201d with this turn.",
      "Regardless of your familiarity with Wilson's Pittsburgh Cycle, \u201cThe Piano Lesson\u201d is a worthwhile, captivating and moving watch full of charismatic performers. Talent isn\u2019t always genetic, but the Washington family is putting in the work to prove otherwise. And with \u201cFences,\u201d\u201cMa Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom\u201d and now \u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d they\u2019re making a mark with a bold and ambitious project that is probably long overdue. Only seven more to go.",
      "\u201cThe Piano Lesson,\u201d a Netflix release in theaters Friday and streaming Nov. 22, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201cstrong language, violent content, some suggestive references and smoking.\u201d Running time: 125 minutes. Three stars out of four."

      "NEW YORK -- Rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine struck a deal to end his current jail stint, agreeing to serve a month behind bars for violating the terms of his release after a felony conviction, prosecutors said Wednesday.",
      "The deal with federal prosecutors was described in a letter partially endorsed by a Manhattan federal judge. It calls for the entertainer to be sentenced to a month in jail, followed by a month of home incarceration, a month of home detention and a month of curfew. He would also be subject to electronic monitoring.",
      "Judge Paul A. Engelmayer said he will sentence the performer whose real name is Daniel Hernandez immediately after he admits to the violations at a Nov. 12 hearing. He said he will require each side to explain why a one-month jail sentence followed by three months of home incarceration, detention or curfew are sufficient for repeated violations of probation.",
      "The terms of the deal also call for Tekashi 6ix9ine to submit to supervision from the court's Probation Department for another year.",
      "Tekashi 6ix9ine, 28, was within a few months of being free from court supervision when he was arrested on Oct. 29 after his probation officer complained that he wasn't following rules about obtaining permission in advance to travel and that he had failed drug tests.",
      "In 2019, Engelmayer sentenced him to two years in prison in a racketeering case after the musician pleaded guilty that same year to charges accusing him of joining and directing violence by the gang known as the Nine Trey Gangsta Bloods.",
      "In April 2020, Tekashi 6ix9ine was freed months early from his prison sentence after complaining that his ailments made him particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, which was spreading through the nation's jails and prisons.",
      "Engelmayer, expressing dismay at the artist's apparent failure to follow the rules, noted at a hearing last month that he had granted compassionate release to him during the coronavirus crisis.",

      "The song\u2019s question \u2014 courtesy of the Irish post-punk band Fontains D.C. \u2014 is an acute one for \u201cBird.\u201d Arnold\u2019s films ( \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d \u201cFish Tank\u201d) are rigorous in their gritty naturalism. Her fiction films \u2014 this is her first in eight years \u2014 tend toward bleak, hand-held verit\u00e9 in rough-and-tumble real-world locations. Her last film, \u201cCow,\u201d documented a mother cow separated from her calf on a dairy farm.",
      "Arnold specializes in capturing souls, human and otherwise, in soulless environments. A dream of something more is tantalizing just out of reach. In \u201cAmerican Honey,\u201d peace comes to Star (Sasha Lane) only when she submerges underwater.",
      "In \u201cBird,\u201d though, this sense of otherworldly possibility is made flesh, or at least feathery. After a confusing night, Bailey awakens in a field where she encounters a strange figure in a skirt ( Franz Rogowski ) who arrives, like Mary Poppins, with a gust a wind. His name, he says, is Bird. He has a soft sweetness that doesn\u2019t otherwise exist in Bailey\u2019s hardscrabble and chaotic life.",
      "She\u2019s skeptical of him at first, but he keeps lurking about, hovering gull-like on rooftops. He cranes his neck now and again like he\u2019s watching out for Bailey. And he does watch out for her, helping Bailey through a hard coming of age: the abusive boyfriend (James Nelson-Joyce) of her mother (Jasmine Jobson); her half brother (Jason Buda) slipping into vigilante violence; her father marrying a new girlfriend.",
      "The introduction of surrealism has the ironic effect of breaking the spell that has marked Arnold\u2019s best films. \u201cBird,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday, is, like the writer-director\u2019s vivid previous work, a movie only she could make. Arnold has described it as the hardest thing she\u2019s ever created, and it\u2019s easy to applaud her for grasping at something in \u201cBird\u201d that ultimately is just out of reach. A resolutely realistic filmmaker turning to magical realism has the uncomfortable effect of making the whole movie, not just the Rogowski bits, feel inauthentic. Instead of being \u201ctoo real for ya,\u201d \u201cBird,\u201d with its in-your-face poverty and narrative extremes, never feels particularly real at all.",
      "The most incongruous parts of \u201cBird,\u201d though, might not be the mysterious avian friend. (Rogowski, a compelling performer, only ever feels half in the movie, as if \u201cBird\u201d can\u2019t quite commit to him being there, either.) Keoghan is a reliably arresting actor who here feels out of place. He doesn\u2019t seem even vaguely fatherly, and while that might be part of the point, too many other things about Bug feel more performative than genuine. There\u2019s his scheme to use hallucinogenic slime from a toad to pay for his wedding, for starters. Add in some karaoke scenes and the sensation creeps in that \u201cBird\u201d is being less compelled by its own story than it is by a pursuit of Arnold\u2019s previous style.",
      "\u201cBird\u201d may go down as a rare miss for Arnold but you can still see the keenness of her eye and the nimbleness of her camera, with her regular cinematographer Robbie Ryan. And that\u2019s true never so much as when the camera is on Adams, a talent, whose melancholy eyes say more than all the theatrics around her.",
      "\u201cBird,\u201d a Mubi release, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201clanguage throughout, some violent content and drug material.\u201d Running time: 118 minutes. Two stars out of four."

      "Megan Park is just getting started as a filmmaker",
      "Megan Park feels a little bad that her movie is making so many people cry. It's not just a single tear either \u2014 more like full body sobs.",
      "She didn\u2019t set out to make a tearjerker with \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d now streaming on Prime Video. She just wanted to tell a story about a young woman in conversation with her older self. The film is quite funny (the dialogue between 18-year-old and almost 40-year-old Elliott happens because of a mushroom trip that includes a Justin Bieber cover), but it packs an emotional punch, too.",
      "Writing, Park said, is often her way of working through things. When she put pen to paper on \u201cMy Old Ass,\u201d she was a new mom and staying in her childhood bedroom during the pandemic. One night, she and her whole nuclear family slept under the same roof. She didn\u2019t know it then, but it would be the last time, and she started wondering what it would be like to have known that.",
      "In the film, older Elliott ( Aubrey Plaza ) advises younger Elliott ( Maisy Stella ) to not be so eager to leave her provincial town, her younger brothers and her parents and to slow down and appreciate things as they are. She also tells her to stay away from a guy named Chad who she meets the next day and discovers that, unfortunately, he's quite cute.",
      "At 38, Park is just getting started as a filmmaker. Her first, \u201cThe Fallout,\u201d in which Jenna Ortega plays a teen in the aftermath of a school shooting, had one of those pandemic releases that didn\u2019t even feel real. But it did get the attention of Margot Robbie \u2019s production company LuckyChap Entertainment, who reached out to Park to see what other ideas she had brewing.",
      "\u201cThey were very instrumental in encouraging me to go with it,\u201d Park said. \u201cThey\u2019re just really even-keeled, good people, which makes them great producers. They treat everybody the same, which is the vibe that I like. There\u2019s no ego, there\u2019s no hierarchy.\u201d",
      "LuckyChap even empowered her to cast Stella first and to build it out around her. In a more traditional setting, she said, you have to start with the most famous person.",
      "Park came to writing and directing after some 20 years of acting. The product of a small town in Canada (Lindsay, Ontario), she knew she loved the arts but had no connections to the industry. The only job she could imagine for herself was actor, she said. Luckily, she had some success at it, with roles in films (\"Charlie Bartlett\u201d) and television shows like \u201cLife with Derek\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of the American Teenager\u201d (she was Grace, the conservative cheerleader). It was on that show that she met one of her dearest friends, Shailene Woodley, and started to realize that perhaps acting wasn\u2019t quite her passion.",
      "There wasn\u2019t one \u201cah-ha\u201d moment, but she does remember seeing how passionate Woodley was about getting the role \u201cThe Descendants,\u201d which would prove to be her breakout.",
      "\u201cShe really wanted that role and she knew that it was her role and she was just like fighting for it and working so hard and was so passionate. I remember thinking that\u2019s so inspiring and so cool that she feels that way about this. And then I was like, \u2018(expletive), I don\u2019t feel that way about acting.\u2019\"",
      "Instead, Park found that spark in writing, and eventually directing, starting with shorts and music videos for the likes of Billie Eilish, Gucci Mane and even her husband, singer-songwriter Tyler Hilton, before setting off to do a feature.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t really know that writing and directing movies was a viable career. So I came about it a little bit backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel so lucky that I had such an education of like 20 years on a film set before I was ever behind the camera, where I was really absorbing way more than I thought I was absorbing.\u201d",
      "As a filmmaker, Park said she has two aesthetic extremes inside of her. The first is \u201cheartfelt, evergreen, nostalgic movies.\u201d Think Chris Columbus, \u201cStepmom,\u201d \u201cMrs. Doubtfire\u201d and \u201cMy Girl,\u201d she said. Her other passion is quiet, French, female-driven cinema. C\u00e9line Sciamma\u2019s \u201cTomboy\u201d is the only movie she has downloaded on her computer. On set, she likes to keep things calm, reminding those around her that they\u2019re not \u201csaving lives.\u201d",
      "\u201cI genuinely think that\u2019s an important mentality to have because people get so caught up in it. There\u2019s always going to be a fire, there\u2019s always going to be not enough time, but there\u2019s always going to be a fix to the problem,\u201d she said. \u201cI try to just be clear with what I need, but also really flexible. I think the best directors are people who consider their role as not as the end-all, be-all genius behind the magic because you\u2019re not. You\u2019re the curator of creating an environment for creativity to thrive.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s seen all the extremes as an actor: The energies that work, the ones that don\u2019t and how all actors need different things from the director. And her actors appreciate that about her.",
      "\u201cI want every single movie for the rest of my life to be directed by a woman,\u201d said Stella. \u201cIt was one of my favorite experiences. I was just constantly surrounded by female energy, which was very inspiring for me and very safe. It just felt very cozy and sweet and it was very easy to work in that environment.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been almost a year now since \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d became one of the breakout films of the Sundance Film Festival, and almost three years since she started working on it, or, basically half of her nearly 5-year-old daughter\u2019s life (she calls it \u201cthe Maisie movie\u201d). With a new 4-month-old as well, she's just started work on another film. But she\u2019s still feeling the glow from \u201cMy Old Ass\u201d and the effect it\u2019s having on audiences.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t really get your hopes that high that people are going to feel anything, let alone how deeply they seem to be feeling the movie,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been kind of surreal, honestly and really beautiful and hard to metabolize it all.\u201d"

      "Four years ago, Fox News precipitated an internal crisis with a bold election night call that President Joe Biden would beat Donald Trump in the crucial state of Arizona. This year illustrated the difference that four years can make.",
      "Fox News wasn't the first network early on Wednesday to declare Trump had sealed his victory over Kamala Harris \u2014 upstart NewsNation, conservative rival Newsmax and Scripps Networks led the way \u2014 but its ultimate call came nearly four hours before ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC and The Associated Press made theirs.",
      "Judging by the cheers that erupted when Fox's call was shown to the Trump faithful gathered at his West Palm Beach victory party, it was a decision that surely was received much better by its viewers than the 2020 call was.",
      "\u201cWhen you don't like how the cake tastes, you're not going to like the recipe,\u201d said Chris Stirewalt, politics editor at NewsNation. \u201cWhen you like the cake, you'll love the recipe.\u201d",
      "Fox's Bret Baier called Trump's victory \u201cthe biggest political phoenix from the ashes story that we have ever seen,\u201d and Fox can claim a comeback of its own.",
      "Fox's Arizona call in 2020 infuriated Trump and many of the network's viewers. While it ultimately proved correct, it set in motion furious internal second-guessing and led some Fox personalities to embrace conspiracy theories, which ultimately cost the network a staggering $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit by Dominion Voting Systems.",
      "NewsNation, which used information from the elections forecasting company Decision Desk HQ, made its call at 1:22 a.m. on Wednesday. Scripps and Newsmax, which also use DDHQ, were within a minute of making the same declaration.",
      "At about that time, Baier said that \u201cwe're not there yet,\u201d but noted there was no path to victory for Harris. Fox made its call at 1:47 a.m.",
      "The AP called the election for Trump at 5:34 a.m. ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and the AP all made their calls within a few moments of each other. The AP explained that its declaration that Trump had won came after awarding Wisconsin to the former president by determining that remaining uncounted votes from around the Milwaukee area would not be enough for Harris to overcome Trump's lead there.",
      "For NewsNation's Stirewalt, his network's early call on Wednesday provided a rich irony. He was politics editor at Fox News in 2020 and he and a fellow executive, Bill Sammon, were essentially fired following the outcry over the Arizona call \u2014 even though they were proven right.",
      "\u201cIt would be easy to overstate the results and I want to be careful not to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cI will say this, it is a victory for the way things used to be done and a personal vindication.\u201d",
      "He said Decision Desk HQ and NewsNation let the numbers do the talking with their calls. He would not criticize rivals for waiting longer, saying it was a natural reaction to be careful in making race calls following what happened in 2020.",
      "The happiness of some viewers at Fox's call was evident in some social media posts. Fox rejects any suggestion that its calls are politically motivated and its decision desk, led by veteran Arnon Mishkin, is widely respected in the industry. Stirewalt called Mishkin \u201csuperb\u201d and said \u201cit is to Fox's credit that they kept him when they didn't keep Bill Sammon and me.\u201d",
      "A vigorous conservative media ecosystem has built up in recent years to compete with Fox. But the network remains king of the hill, illustrated again Wednesday by the Nielsen company's preliminary ratings of television election night coverage.",
      "Fox averaged 9.7 million viewers for its coverage in the prime-time hours, well above second-place ABC News, which had 5.7 million. Newsmax, Fox's chief rival for conservative viewers, had 947,000 viewers and NewsNation had 237,000, Nielsen said.",
      "\u201cI am extremely proud of our team\u2019s commitment to delivering the top reporting and analysis to the largest and most politically diverse audience in news,\u201d Fox News Media CEO Suzanne Scott said of Tuesday night\u2019s ratings, according to the network.",
      "Trump's complicated relationship with the network also attests to its continued influence. The Republican candidate was a regular guest on its shows during the campaign, particularly the morning \u201cFox & Friends,\u201d yet also complains bitterly on social media if he doesn't like something that is said there.",

      "Prosecutors also said that Payne\u2019s toxicological exams showed that his body had \"traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant\u201d in the moments before his death.",
      "Investigators said hours after Payne\u2019s death that he was by himself when he fell. But the prosecutors' office said Thursday that one of the people charged was often with the singer during his time in Buenos Aires. The second is a hotel staffer who allegedly gave Payne cocaine during his stay between Oct. 13 and 16. And the third is a drug dealer.",
      "The charges in Payne\u2019s case bear some resemblance to the U.S. cases stemming from the death of \u201cFriends\u201d star Matthew Perry a year ago. The actor\u2019s personal assistant and a longtime friend are among those charged with helping supply him with ketamine in the final months of his life, leading up to his overdose on the anesthetic.",
      "Three young men were similarly charged in the opioid-overdose death of rapper Mac Miller in 2018.",
      "Local authorities gathered, among other pieces of evidence, Payne's cell phone records, material for forensics and testimonies. They are yet to unlock the singer\u2019s personal computer \u2013 which is damaged \u2013 and other devices that were seized.",
      "Payne\u2019s autopsy showed his injuries were neither caused by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious.",
      "Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the chances of Payne committing suicide.",
      "One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne \u2014 like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson \u2014 pursued a solo career.",
      "The singer had posted on his Snapchat account that he traveled to Argentina to attend Horan\u2019s concert in Buenos Aires on Oct. 2. He shared videos of himself dancing with his girlfriend, American influencer Kate Cassidy, and singing along in the stands. Cassidy had left Argentina after the show, but Payne stayed behind.",

      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d is enjoying another weekend at the top of the box office charts",
      "\u201cVenom: The Last Dance\u201d enjoyed another weekend at the top of the box office. The Sony release starring Tom Hardy added $26.1 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "It was a relatively quiet weekend for North American movie theaters leading up to the presidential election. Charts were dominated by big studio holdovers, like \u201cVenom 3,\u201d \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d and \u201cSmile 2,\u201d while audiences roundly rejected the Tom Hanks, Robin Wright and Robert Zemeckis reunion \u201cHere.\u201d Thirty years after \u201cForrest Gump,\u201d \u201cHere\u201d opened to only $5 million from 2,647 locations.",
      "\u201cVenom 3\u201d only fell 49% in its second weekend, which is a notably small drop for a superhero film, though it didn\u2019t exactly open like one either. In two weeks, the movie has made over $90 million domestically; The first two opened to over $80 million. Globally, the picture is brighter given that it has already crossed the $300 million threshold.",
      "Meanwhile, Universal and Illumination\u2019s \u201cThe Wild Robot\u201d continues to attract moviegoers even six weeks in (and when it\u2019s available by video on demand), placing second with $7.6 million. That's up 11% from last weekend. The animated charmer has made over $121 million in North America and $269 million worldwide.",
      "\"'The Wild Robot' has quietly been this absolute juggernaut for the fall season,\" said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. \u201cFor that film to see an increase after six weeks is astounding.\u201d",
      "\u201cSmile 2\u201d landed in third place with $6.8 million, helping to push its worldwide total to $109.7 million.",
      "The time-hopping \u201cHere,\u201d a graphic novel that was adapted by \u201cForrest Gump\u201d screenwriter Eric Roth, was financed by Miramax and distributed by Sony\u2019s TriStar. With a fixed position camera, it takes audiences through the years in one living room. Critics were not on board: In aggregate it has a lousy 36% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cIt was a slow weekend anyway, but it didn\u2019t resonate in a way that many thought it might,\" Dergarabedian said. \"There are a lot of films out there for the audience that \u2018Here\u2019 was chasing.\"",
      "Despite playing in almost 1,000 more locations, \u201cHere\u201d came in behind Focus Features' papal thriller \u201cConclave,\u201d which earned $5.3 million. Playing in 1,796 theaters, \u201cConclave\u201d dropped only 20% from its debut last weekend and has made $15.2 million so far. Two Indian films also cracked the top 10 in their debuts, \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3\u201d and \u201cSingham Again.\u201d",
      "Overall box office continues to lag behind 2023 by almost 12%. But holiday moviegoing will likely give the industry an end-of-year boost with titles like \u201cGladiator II\u201d and \u201cWicked\u201d on the way.",
      "\u201cIn a couple of weeks, it\u2019ll get a lot more competitive,\u201d Dergarabedian said.",
      "Jesse Eisenberg\u2019s film \u201cA Real Pain,\u201d a comedic drama about cousins on a Holocaust tour in Poland, launched in four theaters this weekend in New York and Los Angeles. It made an estimated $240,000, or $60,000 per screen, which is among the top three highest per theater averages of the year. Searchlight Pictures will be expanding the well-reviewed film nationwide in the coming weeks, going wide on Nov. 15 to over 800 theaters.",
      "Box office charts don\u2019t always paint a full picture of the moviegoing landscape, however. This weekend several relatively high-profile films playing in theaters did not report full grosses for various reasons, including the Clint Eastwood film \u201cJuror #2,\u201d Steve McQueen\u2019s WWII film \u201cBlitz\u201d and the Cannes darling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez.\u201d Netflix, which is handling \u201cEmilia P\u00e9rez,\u201d never reports box office. Apple Original Films is following suit with \u201cBlitz,\u201d a likely awards contender, which is in theaters before hitting Apple TV+ on Nov. 22.",
      "\u201cJuror No. 2\u201d is a Warner Bros. release, and a well-reviewed one at that. The film directed by Eastwood stars Nicholas Hoult as a juror on a murder case who faces a big moral dilemma. Domestic ticket sales were withheld. The studio did say that it earned $5 million from international showings, where it played on 1,348 screens.",
      "Even major studios withhold box office numbers occasionally. Earlier this year, Disney did not report on the Daisy Ridley movie \u201cYoung Woman and the Sea.\u201d Results were most notably withheld during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\"It\u2019s really up to the distributors,\" Dergarabedian said. \u201cOften times the reason that certain movies may not be reported is that there\u2019s a chance that the quality of the movie will be conflated with the box office number.\u201d",
      "Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, were:",
      "1. \u201cVenom: The Last Dance,\u201d $26.1 million.",
      "2. \u201cThe Wild Robot,\u201d $7.6 million.",

      "8. \u201cSingham Again,\u201d $2.1 million.",
      "9. \u201cBeetlejuice Beetlejuice,\u201d $2.1 million.",
      "10. \u201cBhool Bhulaiyaa 3,\u201d $2.1 million.___This story has been corrected to reflect that the seventh film in the top 10 was \u201cTerrifier 3,\u201d not \u201cTerrifier 2.\u201d"

      "After months of reporting on what polls described as a remarkably close race, news outlets finally have the chance to report on actual results",
      "For all the concerns about a tumultuous process that could leave Americans waiting for days to learn who its next president would be, news outlets instead experienced an election night that hewed close to tradition.",
      "Fox News Channel declared Donald Trump had reclaimed the presidency at 1:47 a.m. on Wednesday. Broadcast networks and The Associated Press had Trump on the precipice of returning to the presidency when he took the stage in Florida at 2:25 a.m. to declare victory. \u201cThis is, I believe, the greatest political movement of all time,\u201d Trump said onstage at his victory party in West Palm Beach.",
      "His opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, would speak later Wednesday morning, her campaign manager said, dispersing a crowd that had gathered to celebrate her at Howard University.",
      "Broadcast, cable news networks, digital news sites and one streaming service \u2014 Amazon \u2014 covered the count steadily into Wednesday morning. Many of their journalists had warned viewers that determining the winner could be a protracted process that could take several days, like it had in 2020.",
      "Yet from the first hints provided by exit poll results shortly after 5 p.m. Eastern time, the election night story moved methodically in Trump's direction. The dam broke at 11:18 p.m. on Tuesday, when the AP called the first of seven battleground states, North Carolina, for the former president.",
      "The networks moved quickly into the post-mortem stage.",
      "\u201cThis looks a lot more like 2016 to me than 2020,\u201d NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd said, a reference to Trump\u2019s victory that year over Democrat Hillary Clinton.",
      "Fox News Channel pointed to exit poll results that showed Trump making gains among young voters and Latinos. \u201cThe Biden-Harris people pushed them into Trump\u2019s open arms,\u201d said Fox\u2019s Dana Perino, a former White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.",
      "\u201cMaybe,\u201d Fox News' Brit Hume said, \u201cit's time for his enemies to stop it.\u201d",
      "In his speech, Trump praised his running mate, JD Vance, for \u201cgoing into the enemy camp\u201d for interviews on places like CNN and MSNBC. \u201cHe absolutely obliterated them,\u201d he said.",
      "Hours earlier, when the first exit poll results showed the unpopularity of President Joe Biden and Americans with a dim view of where the country was headed, CNN\u2019s Chris Wallace said that \u201cit would be a miracle if Harris could win with that.\u201d His colleagues, Dana Bash and Audie Cornish, warned him of jumping to conclusions that Harris would be blamed for that, but Wallace sounded more prescient as the night progressed.",
      "\u201cShe was trying to do something as a sitting vice president that had never been done before \u2014 succeed an unpopular president,\u201d Todd said.",
      "Former Sen. Claire McCaskill, an NBC News analyst, said the element of race could not be discounted. Some Americans were more comfortable with President Joe Biden, a white man, than Harris, who was attempting to be the first woman of color to be elected president, she said.",
      "\u201cCan you imagine a woman of color acting the way Donald Trump acted \u2014 even for one day?\u201d CNN analyst Van Jones said. \u201cThe kinds of stuff that he said, the kinds of stuff that he did, the way that he would insult people. If you're a person of color, you don't feel like you have the freedom.\u201d",
      "Trump had \u201ca license to just be a fool, just to be an obnoxious ass ... and he gets to be president,\u201d Jones said.",
      "Due to remarkably close pre-election polls, the outcome was considered a mystery that could take many days to resolve. In his last pre-election prediction, statistician Nate Silver said it was no better than a coin flip, giving an ever-so-slight edge to Harris.",
      "The New York Times' predictive Needle judged the contest a \u201ctoss-up\u201d in the beginning of the evening, leaning slightly toward Trump. But it moved steadily in Trump's direction, to the point where the Times by midnight judged Trump with a 90 percent likelihood of capturing the presidency again.",
      "Also by midnight, CNN's count had Trump leading Harris in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2014 the so-called blue wall that was central to her strategy for victory.",
      "\u201cIt's not mission impossible\u201d for Harris to come back and win Pennsylvania, CNN's John King said, looking over voter statistics. \u201cBut it's becoming mission improbable.\u201d Within two hours, CNN awarded Pennsylvania to Trump.",
      "For much of the night, the journalists who stood before \u201cmagic boards\u201d \u2014 King, Bill Hemmer on Fox News Channel, Steve Kornacki on MSNBC \u2014 took up much of the airtime with granular reports on results. State-by-state, county-by-county, they showed numbers where Trump was outperforming his 2020 campaign and Harris lagged behind Biden\u2019s results.",
      "If anything, the networks relied too much on their numbers czars than on their reporters.",
      "The presence of actual results were a tonic to news organizations that had weeks \u2014 and an excruciatingly long day of voting \u2014 to talk about an election campaign that polls have repeatedly shown to be remarkably tight. They tried to extract wisdom from anecdotal evidence.",
      "\u201cDixville Notch is a metaphor for the entire race,\u201d CNN\u2019s Alyssa Farah Griffin said, making efforts to draw meaning from the tiny New Hampshire community that reported its 3-3 vote for Harris and Trump in the early morning hours.",
      "Former NBC News anchor Brian Williams, during his one-night leading Amazon's streamcast appearance, had one unexpected guest in the California studio where he was operating. Puck reporter Tara Palmeri was supposed to report from Trump headquarters in West Palm Beach but was denied credentials to attend by the former president's team.",
      "Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita described her as a \u201cgossip columnist\u201d in a post on the social media site X. Palmeri told Williams she had accurately reported some anxiety within the Trump camp about who was voting early.",

      "Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince\u2019s only full sibling, died Monday",
      "NEW YORK -- Minneapolis musician Tyka Nelson, Prince's only full sibling, died Monday at North Memorial Health in Robbinsdale, Minnesota, her son President Nelson confirmed to The Associated Press. She was 64.",
      "A cause of death was not immediately available, and President Nelson said he doesn't expect to know \u201cfor a couple of days.\u201d",
      "Born to jazz musician John L. Nelson and Mattie Della Shaw in 1960, two years after Prince, Nelson was a singer-songwriter, releasing four albums across her career, starting with 1988's \u201cRoyal Blue.\" That album produced her biggest hits, \u201cMarc Anthony\u2019s Tune,\u201d which spent 11 weeks on Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at No. 33, and \u201cL.O.V.E.,\" which spent seven weeks on the chart and topped at No. 52.",
      "At the time, she told the Star Tribune of Minneapolis, \u201cThe album is basically about love relationships between a man and a woman. I\u2019m royal blue because I can\u2019t find him,\u201d she said.",
      "It's an alternative to her brother's chosen color of purple. Of their relationship, she said: \u201cThe funniest thing is people say, \u2018How does it feel to be Prince\u2019s sister?\u2019 They don\u2019t actually realize what they\u2019re saying. I\u2019ve been Prince\u2019s sister ever since I got here on Earth.\u201d",
      "The Associated Press described her \u201cRoyal Blue\u201d album as \"mostly adult-contemporary or easy-listening\" material, \u201cfar removed from Prince and the so-called Minneapolis sound. Hers is a mature, romantic sound aimed at 25- to 45-year-olds.\u201d",
      "Then came 1992's \u201cYellow Moon, Red Sky,\u201d 2008's \u201cA Brand New Me,\u201d and finally, 2011's \u201cHustler.\u201d",
      "Nelson is survived by two sons, President and Sir, and five grandchildren.",
      "\u201cBorn 1960, the daughter of Mattie and John Nelson, she was best known as Prince\u2019s sister and worked to keep his legacy alive with his fans attending fan and industry events,\u201d President Nelson shared in a statement. \u201cServices will be private, and in lieu of flowers, the family has asked that you take care of one another.\u201d",
      "According to the Star Tribune, Nelson was scheduled to retire and perform a farewell concert at the Dakota in downtown Minneapolis in June. Illness caused her not to take the stage. A few days before the concert, she said she had a mixtape on the way and was working on a memoir.",
      "Prince died of an accidental fentanyl overdose in 2016 at his home in Minneapolis. He was 57. He had no will, and his six siblings inherited equal interests in the estate: Tyka Nelson and five half-siblings \u2014 Sharon Nelson, Norrine Nelson, John R. Nelson, Omarr Baker and Alfred Jackson.",
      "Tyka Nelson, Baker and Jackson, the three youngest, sold their stake to a music publishing company called Primary Wave Music, LLC, which later assigned its interests to an affiliate, Prince OAT Holdings LLC. Jackson has since died.",

      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",
      "The customs documentation stated the containers contained iron oxide, according to local reports.",
      "\u201cThe case is under investigation from the Durres prosecutor's office and the Ministry of Tourism and Environment is cooperating for anything that the justice institution asks for,\u201d ministry spokesperson Erjon Uka told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "Albania's opposition accused the government in August of taking part in illegally trafficking hazardous material.",
      "Prime Minister Edi Rama said in Parliament in September that the shipment\u2019s documents were verified and that iron oxide is \u201cnot considered as toxic waste in the European catalogs on which the environmental and customs procedure of our country is based.\u201d",
      "Speaking to a parliamentary commission on Friday, Environment Minister Mirela Kumbaro said the case should not be politically exploited to spread panic.",
      "She urged for calm to allow the investigation to proceed.",
      "The ship, she said, is suspected of carrying hazardous waste but \u201chazardous waste does not mean toxic\u201d waste, adding that transport companies had declared the cargo consisted of \u201cnormal goods\u201d \u2014 and that it was only now being described as hazardous waste.",
      "The Seattle-based NGO has called on Albanian authorities to have a public opening and sampling of the containers to ensure transparency of the investigation.",
      "BAN has also said that while Albania is looking to join the European Union and the government has been eager to align its hazardous waste policy with that of the 27-nation bloc, it should ban \u201cthe export of hazardous wastes, household wastes, electronic wastes and plastic wastes to developing countries.\u201d",

      "Health officials say it's important to get flu and COVID-19 vaccines ahead of the holidays when respiratory bugs tend to spread",
      "WASHINGTON -- If you missed the early fall push for flu and COVID-19 vaccines, it's not too late.",
      "Health officials say it's important to get vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when respiratory bugs tend to spread with travel and indoor celebrations.",
      "Those viruses haven't caused much trouble so far this fall. But COVID-19 tends to jump in the winter months, a rise that usually starts around Thanksgiving and peaks in January.",
      "And that coincides with flu season, which tends to start in November or December and peak in January or February.",
      "It takes the body about two weeks to build up immunity after either shot \u2014 meaning vaccination is needed before these viruses start spreading. A lot of older adults also need protection against another risky winter virus, RSV.",
      "Yes, you can get your flu and COVID-19 shots at the same time. Don't call them boosters \u2014 they're not just another dose of last year\u2019s protection. The coronavirus and influenza are escape artists that constantly mutate to evade your body\u2019s immune defenses, so both vaccines are reformulated annually to target newer strains.",
      "While they\u2019re not perfect, vaccinations offer strong protection against a bad case of flu or COVID-19 \u2014 or dying from it.",
      "\u201cIt may not prevent every infection but those infections are going to be less severe,\u201d said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cI would rather have my grandmother or my great-grandmother have a sniffle than have to go to the emergency room on Thanksgiving.\u201d",
      "Last year, just 45% of adults got a flu vaccination and even fewer, 23%, got a COVID-19 shot.",
      "\u201cOur best defense to protect ourselves, our loved ones and all those around us is a simple shot,\u201d Dr. Bruce A. Scott, president of the American Medical Association, said in a recent statement.",
      "While it may have faded from the headlines, the coronavirus still killed more Americans than flu last year.",
      "\u201cMaybe we believe that it\u2019s not going to be me but let\u2019s not take a chance,\u201d said Dr. Michael Knight of George Washington University. \u201cWhy not get a vaccine that\u2019s going to help you reduce that risk?\u201d",
      "The CDC urges both an updated COVID-19 shot and yearly flu vaccine for everyone ages 6 months and older. If you recently had COVID-19, you can wait two or three months but still should get an updated vaccination because of the expected winter surge.",
      "Both viruses can be especially dangerous to certain groups including older people and those with weak immune systems and lung or heart disease. Young children also are more vulnerable. The CDC counted 199 child deaths from flu last year.",
      "Pregnancy also increases the chances of serious COVID-19 or flu \u2013 and vaccination guards mom plus ensures the newborn has some protection, too.",
      "In addition, the CDC is recommending that people 65 and older get a second COVID-19 shot six months after their fall dose to boost their year-round protection, since the coronavirus isn't just a winter threat. People with weakened immune systems are eligible for extra doses, too.",
      "Last fall\u2019s shots targeted a coronavirus strain that\u2019s no longer spreading while this year\u2019s are tailored to a new section of the coronavirus family tree. The Pfizer and Moderna shots are formulated against a virus subtype called KP.2 while the Novavax vaccine targets its parent strain, JN.1. Daskalakis said all should offer good cross protection to other subtypes now spreading.",
      "The Pfizer and Moderna mRNA vaccines can be used by adults and children as young as 6 months. The Novavax shot is a more traditional protein vaccine combined with an immune booster, and open to anyone 12 and older.",
      "High-dose shots and one with a special immune booster are designed for people 65 and older, but if they can't find one easily they can choose a regular all-ages flu shot.",
      "For the shot-averse, the nasal spray FluMist is available for ages 2 to 49 at pharmacies and clinics \u2014 although next year it's set to be available for use at home.",
      "All flu vaccinations this year will guard against two Type A flu strains and one Type B strain. Another once-common form of Type B flu quit spreading a few years ago and was removed from the vaccine.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a coldlike nuisance for most people but it, too, packs hospitals every winter and can be deadly for children under 5, the elderly and people with certain high-risk health problems.",
      "The CDC recommends an RSV vaccination for everyone 75 and older, and for people 60 to 74 who are at increased risk. This is a one-time shot, not a yearly vaccination \u2013 but only 24% of seniors got it last year. It's also recommended late in pregnancy to protect babies born during the fall and winter.",
      "And while \u201cyour arm may hurt and you may feel crummy for a day,\u201d it's also fine to get the RSV, flu and COVID-19 vaccines at the same time, Daskalakis said.",
      "The vaccines are supposed to be free under Medicare, Medicaid and most private insurance plans if people use an in-network provider.",
      "About 1.5 million uninsured adults got free COVID-19 vaccinations through a federal program last year but that has ended. Instead, the CDC is providing $62 million to health departments to help improve access. Call your local health department to ask about options.",
      "Check the government website, vaccines.gov, for availability at local pharmacies.",

      "Farmworkers in close contact with infected animals should be tested and offered treatment even if they show no symptoms, said Dr. Nirav Shah, principal director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The new guidance comes after blood tests for 115 farmworkers in Michigan and Colorado showed that eight workers \u2014 or 7% \u2014 had antibodies that indicated previous infection with the virus known as Type A H5N1 influenza.",
      "\u201cThe purpose of these actions is to keep workers safe, to limit the transmission of H5 to humans and to reduce the possibility of the virus changing,\u201d Shah told reporters.",
      "The CDC study provides the largest window to date into how the bird virus first detected in March in dairy cows may be spreading to people. It suggests that the virus has infected more humans than the 46 farmworkers identified in the U.S. as of Thursday. Nearly all were in contact with infected dairy cows or infected poultry.",
      "Outside experts said it\u2019s notable that the study prompted the CDC to take new action. Previous recommendations called for testing and treating workers only when they had symptoms.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant move towards the assessment that these H5N1 viruses are a greater risk than the CDC estimated before,\u201d said Dr. Gregory Gray, an infectious disease researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston.",
      "Every additional infection in animals or humans gives the virus the chance to change in potentially dangerous ways, said Angela Rasmussen, a virus expert at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada.",

      "The CDC study included 45 workers in Michigan and 70 in Colorado tested between June and August. Of the eight workers with positive blood tests, four reported no symptoms. All eight cleaned milking parlors and none used respiratory protection such as face masks. Three said they used eye protection.",
      "High levels of the virus have been found in the milk of infected cows, increasing the risk of exposure and infection, researchers said.",

      "Trent Russell, 34, of Bellevue, Nebraska, who worked at the time as a transplant coordinator for the Washington Regional Transplant Community and had access to hospital records all over the region, was convicted earlier this year of illegally accessing health care records and destroying or altering records at a jury trial.",
      "He was also charged with publishing that information on the internet in 2019, at a time when public speculation about Ginsburg's health and her ability to serve as a justice was a matter of public debate. Prosecutors said he posted the information along with a false claim that Ginsburg had already died. But the jury acquitted Russell on that count.",
      "Ginsburg served on the court until her death in 2020.",
      "Prosecutors said Russell disclosed the health records on forums that trafficked in antisemitic conspiracy theories, including conspiracy theories that Ginsburg was dead, but Russell's motivations for his actions were unclear. Indeed, Russell himself never admitted that he accessed the records, at one point suggesting that perhaps his cat walked across the keyboard in a way that mistakenly called up Ginsburg's data.",
      "Russell's excuses and refusal to accept responsibility prompted blistering critiques from prosecutors, who sought a 30-month sentence.",
      "\u201cHe offered completely implausible excuses with a straight face,\u201d prosecutor Zoe Bedell said.",
      "Russell's lawyer, Charles Burnham, sought a sentence of probation or home detention. He cited Russell's work saving lives as a transplant coordinator and his military record which included a deployment to Afghanistan as mitigating factors.",
      "\u201cMr. Russell has lived a quietly heroic life,\u201d Burnham wrote in court papers. He chalked up the criminal conduct to \u201cbeing stupid.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou chose to blame your cat,\u201d Nachmanoff said.",
      "The court records in the case are carefully redacted to remove any reference to Ginsburg, but during the trial and at Thursday's sentencing hearing, all sides openly acknowledged that Ginsburg was the victim of the privacy breach.",
      "Her status as a public figure, in fact, prompted a debate about the severity of Russell's crime. Prosecutors said her high public profile, in addition to her age and illness, made her a particularly vulnerable victim.",
      "\u201cHe went with the Supreme Court justice who was old, who was sick, and whose sickness was a public concern,\u201d Bedell argued.",
      "Russell's lawyer, on the other hand, argued that Ginsburg's high office and the power that comes with it is the opposite of vulnerability.",
      "Nachmanoff, in issuing his sentence, said he took into account the fact that Russell has a sick step parent who might need care. The judge noted \u201cwith some irony\u201d that the details of the stepparent's health problems are under seal.",
      "\u201cWhy? Because it is sensitive health information \u2014 a benefit you did not provide to Justice Ginsburg,\u201d he said.",

    "story": [
      "The story of \u201cKing,\u201d who doesn't disclose his real name, is similar to that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years",
      "SAO PAULO -- SAO PAULO (AP) \u2014 \u201cKing\u201d doesn\u2019t disclose his real name. Even clients of his Sao Paulo newsstand have to call him by his moniker. The Brazilian online sports gambling addict lowered his profile after a loan shark threatened to put bullets in his head if he didn\u2019t pay up.",
      "Broke and embarrassed, King sought treatment and support earlier this year.",
      "\u201cI was once addicted to slot machines, but then sports betting was so easy that I changed. I got carried away all the time,\" he told The Associated Press.",
      "King\u2019s story is that of many vulnerable Brazilians in recent years. The country has become the third-biggest market in the world for sports betting, following the U.S. and the U.K., a report by data analysis company Comscore said last year. But unlike those countries, rampant advertising and sponsorship have been coupled with an unregulated market. The government is now \u2014 belatedly, some say \u2014 striving to get a handle on the epidemic.",
      "On a recent evening, King's Gamblers Anonymous meeting took place in an improvised classroom inside a church, with coffee and cookies to keep everyone awake, and supportive messages scrawled onto the blackboard. One that's become ubiquitous in Brazil and beyond: \u201cOnly for today I will avoid the first bet.\u201d",
      "King and other attendees, all Christian, started a prayer and the meeting began.",
      "King said his financial problems arose from his addiction to online sports betting, chiefly on soccer.",
      "\u201cI miss the adrenaline rush when I don\u2019t bet,\" he said before the gathering. \"I have managed to stop for a couple of months, but I know that if I do it once again, even a small bet, it will all come back.\u201d",
      "The COVID-19 pandemic was a key driver for Brazilians embracing sports betting. King said he transformed almost every sale during that time into a bet. His hook was the non-stop advertising on TV, radio, social media as well as sponsorship of local soccer teams' jerseys. He asked for bank loans to pay his gambling debts and then, to cover those, went to the moneylender. His total debt now amounts to 85,000 reais ($15,000) \u2014 impossible to pay off with his monthly income of 8,000 reais.",
      "Digging oneself out of debt in Brazil is especially daunting with its sky-high interest rates. Loans from Brazilian banks could add interest of almost 8% per month to the borrowed sum, and from loan sharks could be even more.",
      "Four Gamblers Anonymous meetings attended by the AP in October featured discussions about difficulties paying down debts, forcing working-class members to postpone housing payments and cancel family vacations.",
      "Some members of impoverished Brazilian families have used welfare money for betting instead of paying for groceries and housing, official data suggests. In August, beneficiaries of Brazil\u2019s flagship program Bolsa Familia spent 3 billion reais ($530 million) on sports betting, according to a report from the central bank. That was more than 20% of the program\u2019s total outlay in the month.",
      "Sports betting was made legal in 2018 in a bill signed by former President Michel Temer. The subsequent turmoil has recently been setting off alarm bells, with addicts venting on social media and media reports of people losing huge sums.",
      "On Oct. 1, the economy ministry prevented more than 2,000 betting companies from operating in Brazil for having failed to provide all the required documents. Soccer-loving President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva said in an interview on Oct. 17 that he will shut down the entire market in Brazil if his administration\u2019s new regulations \u2014 presented at the end of July\u2014 fail to work. And Brazil\u2019s Senate on Oct. 25 opened an investigation into betting companies, focusing on crime and addiction.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s tax evasion, money laundering of organized crime, the use of influencers to trick people into betting. These companies need to be audited,\u201d Sen. Soraya Thronicke, who proposed the inquiry, told journalists in Brasilia.",
      "S\u00e9rgio Peixoto, a ride-sharing app driver in Rio, is one of many lower-middle-income Brazilians who have reduced their spending due to sports betting debt. Peixoto\u2019s debt currently amounts to 25,000 reais ($4,400). His monthly income is four times less than that.",
      "\u201cIt stopped being a game, it wasn\u2019t fun. I just wanted to get the money back, so I lost even more,\u201d said Peixoto, 26. \u201cI could have invested that money. It would surely have given me more benefits.",
      "Pressure on people to gamble is everywhere. Current and former soccer players, including Vinicius J\u00fanior, Ronaldo Naz\u00e1rio and Roberto Rivellino, are among the poster boys for local and foreign brands. All but one of the top-tier soccer clubs have betting companies among their main sponsors, with their name and logo emblazoned on their kits. There have been cases of kids and teenagers setting up accounts using their parents' personal information and money, multiple local media outlets have reported.",
      "Brazil's economy ministry estimates that Brazil's sports betting market had $21 billion in transactions last year, a 71% increase compared with the first year of the pandemic, 2020.",
      "The ministry's newly presented regulations include facial recognition systems for gamblers to bet, the identification of a single bank account for transactions involving sports betting, new protections against hackers and the government-authorized domain, bet.br, which will host all betting sites that are legal in Brazil. Once they are in place, come January, between 100 and 150 betting companies will continue to operate in the South American nation.",
      "The changes in Brazil have prompted some companies to take preemptive action. A report by Yield Sec, a technical intelligence platform for online marketplaces, said several betting companies voluntarily restricted their operations in different places after the latest editions of the European Championships and Copa America in the hopes of presenting \u201cthe best possible license application face to the Brazilian authorities.\u201d",
      "Magnho Jos\u00e9 Santos de Sousa, the president of the Legal Gambling Institute, a betting think tank, said Brazil has been flooded by some legal platforms that have licenses in Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar and the United Kingdom, and also illegal sites based in China.",
      "De Sousa expressed hope that the new regulations for advertising, responsible gambling and qualification of sports betting companies will transform the country's deregulated arena into a more serious one that doesn't exploit the vulnerable.",
      "\"The whole operation could turn from water into wine,\u201d he said.",
      "Meantime, the demand for Gamblers Anonymous meetings in Sao Paulo has grown so much in recent years that the weekly gathering, in place since the 1990s, was no longer enough. Many groups have added a second day in the week to help new people recover, mostly sports bettors.",
      "Earlier in October, a group on Sao Paulo's northern edge admitted a man who was struggling with sports betting and card games. The 13 other people in the room stressed that he wasn't alone.",
      "\u201cWelcome,\u201d one long-time attendee said, in a greeting that has become a regular for the group. \u201cToday, you are the most important person here.\u201d",
      "___",
      "Dumphreys reported from Rio de Janeiro.",
      "___",
      "This story was first published on Nov 7, 2024. It was corrected on Nov. 8, 2024 to reflect that the betting platforms from Malta, Cura\u00e7ao, Gibraltar the United Kingdom are legal, not illegal."

    "title": "Donald Trump has sweeping plans for a second administration. Here's what he's proposed",
    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 17:38:26 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration",
      "WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump has promised sweeping action in a second administration.",
      "The former president and now president-elect often skipped over details but through more than a year of policy pronouncements and written statements outlined a wide-ranging agenda that blends traditional conservative approaches to taxes, regulation and cultural issues with a more populist bent on trade and a shift in America's international role.",
      "Trump's agenda also would scale back federal government efforts on civil rights and expand presidential powers.",
      "A look at what Trump has proposed:",
      "\u201cBuild the wall!\u201d from his 2016 campaign has become creating \u201cthe largest mass deportation program in history.\u201d Trump has called for using the National Guard and empowering domestic police forces in the effort. Still, Trump has been scant on details of what the program would look like and how he would ensure that it targeted only people in the U.S. illegally. He\u2019s pitched \u201cideological screening\u201d for would-be entrants, ending birth-right citizenship (which almost certainly would require a constitutional change), and said he\u2019d reinstitute first-term policies such as \u201cRemain in Mexico,\u201d limiting migrants on public health grounds and severely limiting or banning entrants from certain majority-Muslim nations. Altogether, the approach would not just crack down on illegal migration, but curtail immigration overall.",
      "Trump played down abortion as a second-term priority, even as he took credit for the Supreme Court ending a woman\u2019s federal right to terminate a pregnancy and returning abortion regulation to state governments. At Trump\u2019s insistence, the GOP platform, for the first time in decades, did not call for a national ban on abortion. Trump maintains that overturning Roe v. Wade is enough on the federal level. Trump said last month on his social media platform Truth Social that he would veto a federal abortion ban if legislation reached his desk \u2014 a statement he made only after avoiding a firm position in his September debate against Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if his administration would aggressively defend against legal challenges seeking to restrict access to abortion pills, including mifepristone, as the Biden administration has. Anti-abortion advocates continue to wage legal battles over the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s approval of the drug as well as the agency's relaxed prescribing restrictions. Trump is also unlikely to enforce Biden\u2019s guidance that hospitals must provide abortions for women who are in medical emergencies, even in states with bans.",
      "Trump\u2019s tax policies broadly tilt toward corporations and wealthier Americans. That\u2019s mostly due to his promise to extend his 2017 tax overhaul, with a few notable changes that include lowering the corporate income tax rate to 15% from the current 21%. That also involves rolling back Democratic President Joe Biden\u2019s income tax hikes on the wealthiest Americans and scrapping Inflation Reduction Act levies that finance energy measures intended to combat climate change.",
      "Those policies notwithstanding, Trump has put more emphasis on new proposals aimed at working- and middle class Americans: exempting earned tips, Social Security wages and overtime wages from income taxes. It\u2019s noteworthy, however, that his proposal on tips, depending on how Congress might write it, could give a back-door tax break to top wage earners by allowing them to reclassify some of their pay as tip income \u2014 a prospect that at its most extreme could see hedge-fund managers or top-flight attorneys taking advantage of a policy that Trump frames as being designed for restaurant servers, bartenders and other service workers.",
      "Trump\u2019s posture on international trade is to distrust world markets as harmful to American interests. He proposes tariffs of 10% to 20% on foreign goods \u2014 and in some speeches has mentioned even higher percentages. He promises to reinstitute an August 2020 executive order requiring that the federal government buy \u201cessential\u201d medications only from U.S. companies. He pledges to block purchases of \u201cany vital infrastructure\u201d in the U.S. by Chinese buyers.",
      "Trump has called for rolling back societal emphasis on diversity and for legal protections for LGBTQ citizens. Trump has called for ending diversity, equity and inclusion programs in government institutions, using federal funding as leverage.",
      "On transgender rights, Trump promises generally to end \u201cboys in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d a practice he insists, without evidence, is widespread. But his policies go well beyond standard applause lines from his rally speeches. Among other ideas, Trump would roll back the Biden administration\u2019s policy of extending Title IX civil rights protections to transgender students, and he would ask Congress to require that only two genders can be recognized at birth.",
      "The president-elect seeks to reduce the role of federal bureaucrats and regulations across economic sectors. Trump frames all regulatory cuts as an economic magic wand. He pledges precipitous drops in U.S. households\u2019 utility bills by removing obstacles to fossil fuel production, including opening all federal lands for exploration \u2014 even though U.S. energy production is already at record highs. Trump promises to unleash housing construction by cutting regulations \u2014 though most construction rules come from state and local government. He also says he would end \u201cfrivolous litigation from the environmental extremists.\u201d",
      "The approach would in many ways strengthen executive branch influence. That power would come more directly from the White House.",
      "He would make it easier to fire federal workers by classifying thousands of them as being outside civil service protections. That could weaken the government\u2019s power to enforce statutes and rules by reducing the number of employees engaging in the work and, potentially, impose a chilling effect on those who remain.",
      "Trump also claims that presidents have exclusive power to control federal spending even after Congress has appropriated money. Trump argues that lawmakers\u2019 budget actions \u201cset a ceiling\u201d on spending but not a floor \u2014 meaning the president\u2019s constitutional duty to \u201cfaithfully execute the laws\u201d includes discretion on whether to spend the money. This interpretation could set up a court battle with Congress.",
      "As a candidate, he also suggested that the Federal Reserve, an independent entity that sets interest rates, should be subject to more presidential power. Though he has not offered details, any such move would represent a momentous change to how the U.S. economic and monetary systems work.",
      "The federal Department of Education would be targeted for elimination in a second Trump administration. That does not mean that Trump wants Washington out of classrooms. He still proposes, among other maneuvers, using federal funding as leverage to pressure K-12 school systems to abolish tenure and adopt merit pay for teachers and to scrap diversity programs at all levels of education. He calls for pulling federal funding \u201cfor any school or program pushing Critical Race Theory, gender ideology, or other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children.\u201d",
      "In higher education, Trump proposes taking over accreditation processes for colleges, a move he describes as his \u201csecret weapon\u201d against the \u201cMarxist Maniacs and lunatics\u201d he says control higher education. Trump takes aim at higher education endowments, saying he will collect \u201cbillions and billions of dollars\u201d from schools via \u201ctaxing, fining and suing excessively large private university endowments\u201d at schools that do not comply with his edicts. That almost certainly would end up in protracted legal fights.",
      "As in other policy areas, Trump isn\u2019t actually proposing limiting federal power in higher education but strengthening it. He calls for redirecting the confiscated endowment money into an online \u201cAmerican Academy\u201d offering college credentials to all Americans without a tuition charges. \u201cIt will be strictly non-political, and there will be no wokeness or jihadism allowed\u2014none of that\u2019s going to be allowed,\u201d Trump said on Nov. 1, 2023.",
      "Trump insists he would protect Social Security and Medicare, popular programs geared toward older Americans and among the biggest pieces of the federal spending pie each year. There are questions about how his proposal not to tax tip and overtime wages might affect Social Security and Medicare. If such plans eventually involved only income taxes, the entitlement programs would not be affected. But exempting those wages from payroll taxes would reduce the funding stream for Social Security and Medicare outlays. Trump has talked little about Medicaid during this campaign, but his first administration reshaped the program by allowing states to introduce work requirements for recipients.",
      "As he has since 2015, Trump calls for repealing the Affordable Care Act and its subsidized health insurance marketplaces. But he still has not proposed a replacement: In a September debate, he insisted he had the \u201cconcepts of a plan.\u201d In the latter stages of the campaign, Trump played up his alliance with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime critic of vaccines and of pesticides used in U.S. agriculture. Trump repeatedly told rally crowds that he would put Kennedy in charge of \u201cmaking America healthy again.\"",
      "Trump, who claims falsely that climate change is a \u201choax,\u201d blasts Biden-era spending on cleaner energy designed to reduce U.S. reliance on fossil fuels. He proposes an energy policy \u2013 and transportation infrastructure spending \u2013 anchored to fossil fuels: roads, bridges and combustion-engine vehicles. \u201cDrill, baby, drill!\u201d was a regular chant at Trump rallies. Trump says he does not oppose electric vehicles but promises to end all Biden incentives to encourage EV market development. Trump also pledges to roll back Biden-era fuel efficiency standards.",
      "Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance framed their ticket as favoring America\u2019s workers. But Trump could make it harder for workers to unionize. In discussing auto workers, Trump focused almost exclusively on Biden\u2019s push toward electric vehicles. When he mentioned unions, it was often to lump \u201cthe union bosses and CEOs\u201d together as complicit in \u201cthis disastrous electric car scheme.\u201d In an Oct. 23, 2023, statement, Trump said of United Auto Workers, \u201cI\u2019m telling you, you shouldn\u2019t pay those dues.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric and policy approach in world affairs is more isolationist diplomatically, non-interventionist militarily and protectionist economically than the U.S. has been since World War II. But the details are more complicated. He pledges expansion of the military, promises to protect Pentagon spending from austerity efforts and proposes a new missile defense shield \u2014 an old idea from the Reagan era during the Cold War. Trump insists he can end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas war, without explaining how. Trump summarizes his approach through another Reagan phrase: \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d But he remains critical of NATO and top U.S. military brass. \u201cI don\u2019t consider them leaders,\u201d Trump said of Pentagon officials that Americans \u201csee on television.\u201d He repeatedly praised authoritarians like Hungary\u2019s Viktor Orban and Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",

      "An expensive campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats has yielded mixed results",
      "A costly campaign by abortion-rights advocates for state supreme court seats yielded mixed results in Tuesday's election, with Republicans expanding their majority on Ohio's court while candidates backed by progressive groups won in Montana and Michigan.",
      "One of the most expensive and closely watched supreme court races in North Carolina, where a Democratic justice campaigned heavily on abortion rights and Republicans hope to expand their majority, remained too early to call Thursday.",
      "Groups on both the right and left spent millions in the leadup to the election hoping to reshape courts that'll be battlegrounds for voting rights, redistricting, abortion and other issues.",
      "Abortion-rights supporters touted victories in states that Donald Trump won, saying it's a sign that reproductive rights will be key in judicial campaigns after the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade. In states like Montana and Arizona, state courts may soon be tasked with interpreting how abortion-rights amendments voters passed this week would impact existing laws.",
      "\u201cState Supreme Court judges don't really have anything to say about the economy, but they certainly do have something to say about reproductive rights and voting rights and democracy and what your life is going to be like from a right to liberty perspective in your state,\" said Deirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cSo I think we have a real opportunity to define these judges and this level of the ballot by reproductive rights.\u201d",
      "The ACLU spent $5.4 million on court races in Montana, Michigan, North Carolina and Ohio. Planned Parenthood and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee earlier this year announced they were collectively spending $5 million, focusing on court races in those states, as well as in Arizona and Texas.",
      "Conservative groups also spent heavily in those states, but with ads focusing on issues other than abortion such as immigration and crime.",
      "In Ohio, all three Democrats running for the state Supreme Court lost their race. The victory gives Republicans a 6-1 majority on the court, which struck down the state\u2019s six-week abortion ban in October and is expected to hear more cases aiming to undo regulations that, for example, require 24-hour waiting periods or in-person appointments for patients.",
      "\u201cOhioans made a strong statement tonight that will keep the court under Republican control for years to come,\u201d said Dee Duncan, president of the Republican State Leadership Committee's Judicial Fairness Initiative, which spent nearly $1 million on the race.",
      "Michigan Democrats won two seats on the state\u2019s Supreme Court, expanding their majority to 5-2. While the elections are nonpartisan, parties nominate the candidates.",
      "\u201cWith the liberal majority protected, Michigan Dems\u2019 hard work past and future will not be threatened by the MAGA fanatics that threaten our values here in Michigan,\u201d Chair of the Michigan Democratic Party Lavora Barnes said in a statement.",
      "In North Carolina, Justice Allison Riggs trailed narrowly Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin in their race for an eight-year term on the state\u2019s highest court. The Associated Press has not called the race, for which nearly 5.5 million ballots have been counted. Tens of thousands of additional provisional and absentee ballots still had to be reviewed by county election officials, and the trailing candidate could seek a recount if the final margin is narrow enough.",
      "Riggs' campaign focused on reproductive rights, running ads that said Griffin could be a deciding vote on the 5-2 majority Republican court for further abortion restrictions. Griffin had said it was inappropriate for Riggs to talk about an issue that could come before the court.",
      "Heated bids for a pair of seats on Montana's court were a split decision, with county attorney Cory Swanson defeating former U.S. Magistrate Judge Jerry Lynch for chief justice. State judge Katherine Bidegaray defeated state judge Dan Wilson for another open seat on the court.",
      "Progressive groups backed Lynch and Bidegaray, casting the races as key to protecting abortion rights in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and the governor's office. Republicans who complained about the court's rulings against laws that would have restricted abortion access or made it more difficult to vote supported Swanson and Wilson.",
      "A longshot effort by abortion-rights advocates to unseat three justices on Texas' all-Republican Supreme Court fell short, with Jimmy Blacklock, John Devine and Jane Bland winning reelection. The three were part of unanimous rulings rejecting challenges to the state\u2019s abortion ban.",
      "In Arizona, two justices won retention elections despite efforts to oust them over the court decision that cleared way for a long-dormant 1864 law banning nearly all abortions to be enforced. The state Legislature swiftly repealed it, and voters on Tuesday approved a constitutional amendment guaranteeing abortion access up to fetal viability, typically after 21 weeks.",
      "Conservatives also won in Oklahoma, where voters removed one of three Supreme Court justices appointed by a former Democratic governor who were up for retention. A 5-4 ruling by the court last year overturned a portion of the state\u2019s near total ban on abortion. It was the first time any Oklahoma appellate judge had been removed through a retention election.",
      "An Arkansas justice who wrote a blistering dissent when the court's Republican-backed majority blocked an abortion rights measure from the ballot was elected chief justice. That race, however, won't change the court's majority.",
      "The next big battleground comes next year in Wisconsin, where a race will determine whether liberals maintain their 4-3 majority on the court. The open race for retiring Justice Ann Walsh Bradley's seat comes after the court flipped from conservative control in a 2023 election marked by record-breaking spending.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like state supreme court elections are going to go back to the way they were 10 years ago anytime soon,\u201d said Douglas Keith, senior counsel in the judiciary program at the Brennan Center, which has tracked spending on state court races.",

      "Abortion rights advocates prevailed in ballot measures in seven states, but that doesn't resolve the issue",
      "WASHINGTON -- Abortion rights advocates prevailed on seven ballot measures across the U.S. in Tuesday's election and lost on three.",
      "The losses are the first on statewide reproductive rights ballot measures anywhere in the U.S. since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, a ruling that struck down the nearly 50-year nationwide right to abortion, proving that abortion opponents can win on ballot measures.",
      "There were firsts on the other sides, too: Three amendments call for rolling back abortion bans, including one in Missouri that bars it at all stages of pregnancy with exceptions only under limited circumstances to save the life of the woman.",
      "Here's a look at takeaways from the results.",
      "Missouri is the most populous state where a ballot measure could roll back a current ban on abortions at all stages of pregnancy.",
      "But the work isn\u2019t done there.",
      "Planned Parenthood affiliates that operate in Missouri filed in a state court Wednesday seeking to invalidate the state's abortion ban and several laws that regulate the care.",
      "The Missouri amendment, which is to take effect Dec. 5, does not specifically override any state laws. Instead, the measure left it to advocates to ask courts to knock down bans that they believe would now be unconstitutional.",
      "Planned Parenthood leaders said Wednesday on a Zoom call with reporters that they want to start offering abortions at clinics in Columbia, Kansas City and St. Louis if they get the judicial ruling they're requesting \u2014 starting with blocking enforcement of laws on the book.",
      "\"This is only the first step to realizing and fully implementing the protections of Amendment 3. It\u2019s certainly not the last step,\u201d said Richard Muniz, interim president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Rivers.",
      "Clinics had stopped providing abortions in Missouri even before the state\u2019s ban took effect in 2022. They said a list of regulations made it impossible for them to operate. In its legal filing, the Planned Parenthood affiliate that covers much of the state says the onerous requirements include clinicians who provide abortion have surgical licenses and that they conduct pelvic exams on all patients \u2014 even if they offer only medication abortions.",
      "\u201cSome of these patients choose medication abortion precisely because they do not want instruments inserted into their vagina,\u201d Dr. Selina Sandoval, an associate medical director for Planned Parenthood Great Plains, said in a legal filing. \u201cI cannot and will not subject my patients to unnecessary exams.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood also objects to laws requiring clinicians to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals, mandating a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and banning telemedicine for abortion. Besides the ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, the group is calling for having other bans that kick in after eight, 14, 18 and 20 weeks of pregnancy to be struck down.",
      "Abortion rights advocates heralded victories at the ballot box as a signal of widespread support for abortion rights, even in conservative states.",
      "The three states where abortion measures were defeated had special circumstances that weren't present in the others.",
      "In Florida, the threshold for passing a constitutional amendment is 60% while most states require a simple majority. Most voters supported adding abortion rights \u2014 but it fell short of the requirement.",
      "There, Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, also presented a challenge to proponents by steering state GOP funds to counter the measure and defending a state agency for publishing a webpage attacking it, among other government efforts.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure is different from the others because it would have allowed the state to regulate abortion in the second trimester \u2014 but only in ways that protect the health of the woman. Because of that provision, most national abortion rights groups did not put money into promoting it, which could have been a factor in its failure in a conservative state.",
      "In Nebraska, both sides had questions on the ballot. Voters passed the one that bars abortion after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 which is in line with current state law \u2014 and also allows the possibility of more stringent bans. They also rejected the measure that aimed to enshrine into the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, which is considered to be sometime after 21 weeks of pregnancy, though there's not a fixed time.",
      "Abortion rights advocates condemned the novel strategy by anti-abortion groups of putting a competing measure on the ballot as an attempt to confuse voters. The approach was considered by anti-abortion groups elsewhere.",
      "Republican Donald Trump reclaimed the presidency, despite his consistently shifting stances on reproductive rights.",
      "If Republicans win the House, in addition to their victories in the Senate and White House, it could open the door to the passage of a national ban.",
      "Trump has said he would veto a national ban, despite previously declining to answer questions about it.",
      "But Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as \u201cminimum national standards\u201d in order to distort their own stances on the issue, given the political unpopularity of the GOP\u2019s position on abortion.",
      "Judicial appointments have already shaped the national abortion landscape. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who helped form the majority that overturned Roe v. Wade. It's not just the Supreme Court. Trump-nominated U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk has issued rulings with nationwide consequences, including one impacting access to the abortion pill mifepristone.",
      "Through executive power, a president could also restrict abortion pills sent through the mail and declare that a law that requires doctors to stabilize emergency room patients does not require them to provide abortion. A new administration could also pull back on a federal lawsuit that challenges aspects of Idaho's ban.",
      "One interpretation of the presence of some of the ballot measures was that they were put up in part to drive turnout of Democratic voters in candidate elections.",
      "If that was the plan \u2014 and some abortion rights advocates say it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it didn\u2019t seem to sway other statewide races.",

      "Three other Republican states \u2014 Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota \u2014 rejected abortion ballot measures and supported Trump for president and GOP senators where they were on the ballot.",
      "The Democratic states of Colorado and Maryland expanded abortion rights and voted for Democrats in statewide elections. The same is true in New York, where the ballot measure bars discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes\u201d and does not mention abortion specifically \u2014 but was championed by abortion rights advocates, who say it will preserve access.",
      "The measures also passed in Arizona and Nevada, where the presidential and U.S. Senate races had not been called by midday Wednesday.",
      "Democrats in the most competitive Senate races centered their closing argument and ads around abortion, an issue they hoped to capitalize on after it has previously motivated voters up and down the ballot. But abortion rights failed to put them over the top \u2014 including in Montana.",
      "Texas Rep. Colin Allred, a Democrat, failed in his bid to defeat Sen. Ted Cruz after investing $5 million in an ad campaign focused on abortion and invoking the issue in campaign trail speeches and during an October debate. Allred leaned on the personal stories of Texas women impacted by the state's abortion ban that have sparked national outrage.",

      "The former president was asked twice after casting his ballot in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday about a question that the state's voters are considering. If approved, it would prevent state lawmakers from passing any law that penalizes, prohibits, delays or restricts abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which doctors say is sometime after 21 weeks.",

      "Voters are getting a say on abortion policy in Tuesday's election with ballot measures and elections to offices from president to local prosecutors",
      "WASHINGTON -- Voters in nine states are deciding whether their state constitutions should guarantee a right to abortion, weighing ballot measures that are expected to spur turnout for a range of crucial races.",
      "Passing certain amendments in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota likely would lead to undoing bans or restrictions that currently block varying levels of abortion access to more than 7 million women of childbearing age who live in those states.",
      "The future legality and availability of abortion hinges not only on ballot measures, as policies could shift depending on who controls Congress and the presidency. Same with state governments \u2014 including legislatures that pursue new laws, state supreme courts that determine the laws' constitutionality, attorneys general who decide whether to defend them and district attorneys who enforce them.",
      "If all the abortion rights measures pass, \"it\u2019s a sign of how much of a juggernaut support for reproductive rights has become,\u201d said Mary Ziegler, a professor at the University of California Davis School of Law and an expert on the history of reproductive rights in the U.S.",
      "\u201cIf some of them fail,\" she added, \"then you\u2019re going to see some conservatives looking for guidance to see what the magic ingredient was that made it possible for conservatives to stem the tide.\u201d",
      "Abortion rights advocates have prevailed on all seven measures that have appeared since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and ended the nationwide right to abortion. That decision opened the door to bans or restrictions in most GOP-controlled states \u2014 and protections of access in most of those controlled by Democrats.",
      "The abortion rights campaigns have a big fundraising advantage this year. Their opponents' efforts are focused on portraying the amendments as too extreme rather than abortion as immoral.",
      "Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Four more bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 before women often realize they\u2019re pregnant. Despite the bans, the number of monthly abortions in the U.S. has risen slightly, because of the growing use of abortion pills and organized efforts to help women travel for abortion. Still, advocates say the bans have reduced access, especially for lower-income and minority residents of the states with bans.",
      "The bans also are part of a key argument in the presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris calls them \u201cTrump abortion bans,\u201d noting former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in overturning Roe v. Wade. Harris, meanwhile, has portrayed herself as a direct, consistent advocate for reproductive health and rights, including Black maternal health.",
      "Trump has struggled to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights, leaning on his catch-all response that abortion rights should be left up to individual states.",
      "His shifting stances on reproductive rights include vowing in October to veto a national abortion ban, just weeks after the presidential debate when he repeatedly declined to say. Trump also has regularly taken credit for appointing three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade.",
      "After voting in Palm Beach, Florida, on Tuesday, Trump was asked twice how he voted on the abortion measure there \u2014 and didn't answer directly. The first time he said he did \u201ca great job bringing it back to the states.\u201d The second time, he snapped at a reporter, saying \u201cyou should stop talking about that.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s attempt to find a more cautious stance on abortion echoes the efforts of many Republican congressional candidates as the issue has emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP. In competitive congressional races from coast to coast, Republicans distanced themselves from more aggressive anti-abortion policies coming from their party and its allies, despite their records on the issue and previous statements opposing abortion rights.",
      "While the ballot questions have similar aims, each one occupies its own political circumstances.",
      "There\u2019s an added obstacle to passing protections in reliably Republican Florida: Supporters of the amendment must get at least 60% of the vote.",
      "Passing it there and rolling back a 6-week ban that took effect in May would be a blow to Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican with a national profile, who has steered state GOP funds to the cause and whose administration has weighed in, too, with a campaign against the measure, investigators questioning people who signed petitions to add it to the ballot and threats to TV stations that aired one commercial supporting it.",
      "Nebraska has competing ballot measures. One would allow abortion further into pregnancy. The other would enshrine in the constitution the state\u2019s current law, which bars most abortions after 12 weeks \u2014 but would allow for further restrictions.",
      "In South Dakota, the measure would allow some regulations related to the health of the woman after 12 weeks. Because of that wrinkle, most national abortion-rights groups are not supporting it.",
      "In some states, notably Missouri, passing amendments may not expand access immediately. Courts would be asked to invalidate the bans; and there could be legal battles over that. Clinics would need to staff up and get licenses. And some restrictions could remain in effect.",
      "Arizona, a battleground in the presidential election, bans abortion after the first 15 weeks of pregnancy.",
      "The ballot measure there gained momentum after a state Supreme Court ruling in April found that the state could enforce a strict abortion ban adopted in 1864. Some GOP lawmakers joined with Democrats to repeal the law before it could be enforced.",
      "In the Democratic-controlled Colorado and Maryland, the ballot measures would largely put existing policies into the state constitutions, though Colorado\u2019s version could also remove financial barriers to abortion. It would take 55% of the vote to pass there.",
      "Measures maintaining access also are on the ballot in Montana, where a U.S. Senate race could help determine control of the chamber, and Nevada, a battleground in the presidential election.",
      "In Nevada, where control of the state government is divided, the ballot measure would have to be passed this year and again in 2026 to take effect.",
      "New York also has a measure on the ballot that its supporters say would bolster abortion rights. It doesn\u2019t contain the word \u201cabortion\u201d but rather bans discrimination on the basis of \u201cpregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d"

Nebraska is the first state to feature competing abortion amendments on the same ballot since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the nationwide right to abortion and allowing states to decide for themselves.",
      "Initiative 434, which appears at the top of the ballot list, would enshrine in the state constitution Nebraska\u2019s current 12-week abortion ban, which the Legislature passed in 2023 and which includes exceptions for cases of rape and incest and to protect the life of the pregnant woman.",
      "Appearing last on the list is Initiative 439, which would amend the constitution to guarantee the right to have an abortion until viability \u2014 the standard under Roe that is the point at which a fetus might survive outside the womb. Some babies can survive with medical help after 21 weeks of gestation. The measure includes some exceptions, including allowing abortions later in pregnancy to protect the health of the pregnant woman.",
      "Because they\u2019re competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the one that gets the most \u201cfor\u201d votes would be adopted, the secretary of state\u2019s office said.",
      "Elections officials expect the competing measures to help drive high voter turnout, along with the hotly contested presidential race.",
      "Abortion is on the ballot in several other states, as well. Coming into the election, voters in all seven states that have decided on abortion-related ballot measures since the reversal of Roe have favored abortion rights, including in some conservative states.",
      "The measure that would enshrine the 12-week ban in the constitution has been bankrolled by some of Nebraska's wealthiest people, including Republican Sen. Pete Ricketts, who previously served as governor and donated more than $1.1 million. His mother, Marlene Ricketts, gave $4 million to the cause. Members of the Peed family, which owns publishing company Sandhills Global, also gave $1 million.",
      "The effort organized under the name Protect Women and Children is heavily backed by religious organizations, including the Nebraska Catholic Conference, a lobbying group that has organized rallies, phone banks and community townhalls to drum up support for the measure.",
      "The effort to enshrine viability as the standard is called Protect Our Rights Nebraska and has the backing of several medical, advocacy and social justice groups. Planned Parenthood has donated nearly $1 million to the cause, with the American Civil Liberties Union, I Be Black Girl, Nebraska Appleseed and the Women\u2019s Fund of Omaha also contributing significantly to the roughly $3.7 million raised by Protect Our Rights.",
      "Two measures, Initiative 437 and Initiative 438, would legalize the possession and use of medical marijuana, and allow for the manufacture, distribution and delivery of it.",
      "Initiative 437 would let patients and caregivers possess up to 5 ounces (142 grams) of marijuana if recommended by a doctor. Initiative 438 would create the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, which would oversee the private groups that would manufacture and dispense marijuana.",
      "The initiatives have been challenged in court over allegations that the petition campaign to put them on the ballot broke election rules. That means a judge could invalidate them even if voters approve them.",
      "Also on the ballot, Referendum Measure 435 asks voters to retain or repeal a new conservative-backed law that allocates millions of dollars in taxpayer money to fund private school tuition.",
      "And Initiative 436 would require all Nebraska employers to provide at least 40 hours of paid sick leave to their employees."

      "GOMA, Congo -- Some health officials say mpox cases in Congo appear to be \u201cstabilizing\u201d \u2014 a possible sign that the main epidemic for which the World Health Organization made a global emergency declaration in August might be on the decline.",
      "In recent weeks, Congo has reported about 200 to 300 lab-confirmed mpox cases every week, according to WHO. That\u2019s down from nearly 400 cases a week in July. The decline is also apparent in Kamituga, the mining city in the eastern part of Congo where the new, more infectious variant of mpox first emerged.",
      "But the U.N. health agency acknowledged Friday that only 40% to 50% of suspected infections in Congo were being tested \u2014 and that the virus is continuing to spread in some parts of the country and elsewhere, including Uganda.",
      "While doctors are encouraged by the drop in infections in some parts of Congo, it's still not clear what kinds of physical contact is driving the outbreak. Health experts are also frustrated by the low number of vaccine doses the central African nation has received \u2014 265,000 \u2014 and say that delivering the vaccine to where it's needed in the sprawling country is proving difficult. WHO estimates 50,000 people have been immunized in Congo, which has a population of 110 million.",
      "Scientists also say there needs to be an urgent, broader vaccination effort for the entire continent to halt mpox's spread and avoid further worrisome genetic mutations, like the one detected earlier this year in Congo after months of low-level circulation.",
      "\u201cIf we miss this opportunity, the likelihood of another significant outbreak increases substantially,\u201d said Dr. Zakary Rhissa, who heads operations in Congo for the charity Alima.",
      "So far this year, there have been roughly 43,000 suspected cases in Africa and more than 1,000 people have died, mostly in Congo.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen how past outbreaks, such as the one in Nigeria in 2017, can lead to larger global events if not effectively contained,\u201d he said. The 2017 epidemic ended up leading to the 2022 global outbreak of mpox that affected more than 100 countries.",
      "Rhissa said the decline in cases in Kamituga \u2014 where mpox initially spread among sex workers and miners \u2014 is an opening to put more programs in place for vaccination, surveillance and education.",

      "Hamuli said she and other friends who are sex workers each received 2,000 Congolese francs ($0.70) from a charity to get vaccinated against mpox \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t the money that swayed her.",
      "\u201cThe vaccine is also necessary,\" she said. \"I think we\u2019re now protected.\u201d",
      "The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated Congo needs at least 3 million mpox vaccines to stop the virus, and another 7 million for the rest of Africa. So far, WHO and partners have allocated 900,000 vaccines to nine African countries affected by mpox and expect 6 million vaccines to be available by the end of this year.",
      "Mpox epidemics in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda had their origins in Congo, and a number of cases in travelers have also been identified in Sweden, Thailand, Germany, India and Britain.",
      "Fewer than half of the people who are most at risk in Congo have been vaccinated, according to Heather Kerr, Congo director for the the International Rescue Committee.",
      "\u201cWe only have a tiny amount of vaccines, and nothing for the kids,\u201d she said.",
      "The vaccines for Congo are largely coming from donor countries like the U.S and through UNICEF, which mainly uses taxpayer money to buy the shots.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re getting a charitable approach where we only see very small donations of vaccines to Africa,\u201d said Dr. Chris Beyrer, director of the Global Health Institute at Duke University. \u201cWhat we need is a public health approach where we immunize populations at scale.\u201d",

And before a 14-year-old was charged in a deadly shooting this fall at his Georgia high school, a deputy talked to him about an online threat and family warned of an \u201cextreme emergency.\u201d",
      "The investigation report in Harris' case shows the first time he attempted suicide was in the fall of 2021, just before he was scheduled to leave for college. Pandemic disruptions, the arrest of a friend in a homicide and a car wreck all may have contributed to his depression, his family and former boss told investigators.",
      "The police report makes no mention of him attending college. Instead, he worked in the cafeteria at a senior facility, where he sometimes discussed guns with coworkers.",
      "The following August he met with a Washington University psychiatry resident, telling her he thought about shooting people at his old school. He said those thoughts lasted for just one evening and went away, and that there was no planning and he didn\u2019t want to do it.",
      "But soon after, Harris began a countdown to the shooting. His plans included detailed maps of the school and a plan to target teachers, students and the LGBTQ community. He also had plans to burn down his family's home with them inside.",
      "The psychiatrist prescribed medications, but Harris didn\u2019t fill the prescriptions. The report says they developed an emergency plan.",
      "Washington University did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.",
      "Harris then stopped showing up for appointments.",
      "On Oct. 8, he tried to buy a firearm from a licensed dealer in St. Charles, Missouri, but the transaction was blocked by an FBI background check. The report doesn't explain why, and police didn't respond to an email from the AP. The FBI merely provided a list of the 12 reasons for a denial with no other details.",
      "Then on Oct. 10, Harris drove to a nearby suburb to pay a man $580 in cash for the rifle used in the shooting.",
      "Harris\u2019 family grew more concerned on Oct. 15, when two packages from gun and ammunition suppliers arrived. One of his sisters, Noneeka Harris, opened them, finding a body armor vest, magazine holsters and magazines. She then searched his bedroom and found the rifle inside an old TV box.",
      "Harris' mother, Tanya Ward, called BJC Mental Health Services and staff there \u201cdeemed the situation as an immediate threat.\u201d They advised her to take the items to the police department and tell officers about her son\u2019s mental illness.",
      "Police at the station told her they couldn\u2019t take the firearm because Harris was of legal age to possess it. They said she should head home and an officer would meet them there. By the time she returned, Harris was home and insistent that he keep the gun.",
      "His mother was adamant that the gun not be in the house, so the officers suggested a storage unit. The report said the officers also advised her on steps she needed to take to have her son deemed mentally unstable.",
      "Federal law has banned some mentally ill people from buying guns since 1968, including those deemed a danger to themselves or others, who have been involuntarily committed, or judged not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetent to stand trial.",
      "Ultimately, the firearm and other items were loaded into the trunk of Harris' sister's vehicle, including a box of ammunition that arrived the next day. She later drove her brother to a storage facility, which was about 5 miles (8 kilometers) from the high school.",
      "She told police she \u201cknew something was going to happen.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 24, shots rang out as Harris entered his former high school.",
      "It is unclear why Harris targeted the school. A security officer recalled him as somewhat popular and his grade school principal said he wasn\u2019t bullied, according to the investigative report. But as he fired at a dance class, one student told police she heard someone yell, \u201cI hate this school. I hate everybody.\u201d",
      "Fatally wounded, Alexzandria Bell initially ran toward the entrance before slumping to the ground, a security officer reassuring the 10th grader that help was on the way. But then she went quiet.",
      "One class jumped out a window to escape after their physical education teacher, 61-year-old Jean Kuczka, stood between them and Harris. Kuckza was killed.",
      "Harris eventually made his way to the third floor, hiding in a computer lab. The first officer to charge into the lab had a daughter at the school.",
      "\u201cI had everything to lose,\u201d the officer, who was among those to open fire, recalled in the police report. He texted his daughter afterward, telling her, \u201cI killed him.\u201d",
      "Harris' sister told investigators that when she heard about the shooting, she started driving toward the school but then went home instead, waking up her mother who had worked overnight.",
      "Harris' mother later checked her voicemail. There was a message from a hospital asking if she still needed help with her son."

      "Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona voters are set to decide whether to guarantee the right to abortion in the state constitution \u2014 a vote that could cement access after the presidential battleground came close to a near-total ban earlier this year.",
      "Arizona is one of nine states with abortion on the ballot.",
      "Abortion-rights advocates are hoping for a win that could expand access beyond the state's current 15-week limit to the point of fetal viability, a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus. Doctors say it's sometime after 21 weeks, though there's no defined time frame.",
      "Advocates also are counting on the measure to drive interest among Democrats to vote the party line up and down the ballot. When Republicans running in tough races address the ballot measure, they generally don\u2019t dissuade voters from supporting it, though some like Senate candidate Kari Lake say they\u2019re personally voting against it. GOP U.S. Rep. Juan Ciscomani, whose battleground congressional district encompasses Tucson, ran an ad saying he rejects \"the extremes on abortion.\u201d",
      "Arizona has been whipsawed by recent legal and legislative battles centered on abortion. In April, the state Supreme Court cleared the way for enforcement of a long-dormant 1864 law that banned nearly all abortions. The Legislature swiftly repealed it.",
      "In addition to the abortion ballot measure itself, the issue could sway state legislative races and lead to elimination of the voice voters have over retention of state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices.",
      "Arizona for Abortion Access, the coalition leading the ballot measure campaign, has far outpaced the opposition campaign, It Goes Too Far, in fundraising. Opponents argue that the measure is too far-reaching because its physical and mental health exemption post-viability is so broad that it effectively legalizes abortion beyond viability. The measure allows post-viability abortions if they are necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of the mother.",
      "Since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, abortion-rights supporters prevailed in all seven abortion ballot questions, including in conservative-leaning states.",
      "Voters in Arizona are divided on abortion. Maddy Pennell, a junior at Arizona State University, said the possibility of a near-total abortion ban made her \u201cdepressed\u201d and strengthened her desire to vote for the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cI feel very strongly about having access to abortion,\u201d she said.",
      "Kyle Lee, an independent Arizona voter, does not support the abortion ballot measure.",
      "\u201cAll abortion is pretty much, in my opinion, murder from beginning to end,\u201d Lee said.",
      "The Civil War-era ban also shaped the contours of tight legislative races. State Sen. Shawnna Bolick and state Rep. Matt Gress are among the handful of vulnerable Republican incumbents in competitive districts who crossed party lines to give the repeal vote the final push \u2014 a vote that will be tested as both parties vie for control of the narrowly GOP-held state Legislature.",
      "Both of the Phoenix-area lawmakers were rebuked by some of their Republican colleagues for siding with Democrats. Gress made a motion on the House floor to initiate the repeal of the 1864 law. Bolick, explaining her repeal vote to her Senate colleagues, gave a 20-minute floor speech describing her three difficult pregnancies.",
      "While Gress was first elected to his seat in 2022, Bolick is facing voters for the first time. She was appointed by the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors to fill a seat vacancy in 2023. She has not emphasized her role in the repeal vote as she has campaigned, instead playing up traditional conservative issues \u2014 one of her signs reads \u201cBolick Backs the Blue.\u201d",
      "Another question before voters is whether to move away from retention elections for state Superior Court judges and Supreme Court justices, a measure put on the ballot by Republican legislators hoping to protect two justices who favored allowing the Civil War-era ban to be enforced.",
      "Under the existing system, voters decide every four to six years whether judges and justices should remain on the bench. The proposed measure would allow the judges and justices to stay on the bench without a popular vote unless one is triggered by felony convictions, crimes involving fraud and dishonesty, personal bankruptcy or mortgage foreclosure.",
      "Shawnna Bolick\u2019s husband, Supreme Court Justice Clint Bolick, is one of two conservative justices up for a retention vote. Justice Bolick and Justice Kathryn Hackett King, who were both appointed by former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sided with the high court\u2019s majority to allow the enforcement of the 1864 near-total ban. Abortion-rights activists have campaigned for their ouster, but if the ballot measure passes they will keep their posts even if they don\u2019t win the retention election."

      "The last three hospitals still partially functioning in northern Gaza have been encircled by Israeli troops and caught amid fighting for weeks",
      "JERUSALEM -- They were built to be places of healing. But once again, three hospitals in northern Gaza are encircled by Israeli troops and under fire.",
      "Bombardment is pounding around them as Israel wages a new offensive against Hamas fighters that it says have regrouped nearby. As staff scramble to treat waves of wounded, they remain haunted by a war that has seen hospitals targeted with an intensity and overtness rarely seen in modern warfare.",
      "All three were besieged and raided by Israeli troops some 10 months ago. The Kamal Adwan, al-Awda and Indonesian hospitals still have not recovered from the damage, yet are the only hospitals even partially operational in the area.",
      "Medical facilities often come under fire in wars, but combatants usually depict such incidents as accidental or exceptional, since hospitals enjoy special protection under international law. In its yearlong campaign in Gaza, Israel has stood out by carrying out an open campaign on hospitals, besieging and raiding at least 10 of them across the Gaza Strip, some several times, as well as hitting multiple others in strikes.",
      "It has said this is a military necessity in its aim to destroy Hamas after the militants\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. It claims Hamas uses hospitals as \u201ccommand and control bases\u201d to plan attacks, to shelter fighters and to hide hostages. It argues that nullifies the protections for hospitals.",
      "\u201cIf we intend to take down the military infrastructure in the north, we have to take down the philosophy of (using) the hospitals,\u201d Israeli military spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said of Hamas during an interview with The Associated Press in January after the first round of hospital raids.",
      "Most prominently, Israel twice raided Gaza City\u2019s Shifa Hospital, the biggest medical facility in the strip, producing a video animation depicting it as a major Hamas base, though the evidence it presented remains disputed.",
      "But the focus on Shifa has overshadowed raids on other facilities. The AP spent months gathering accounts of the raids on al-Awda, Indonesian and Kamal Adwan Hospitals, interviewing more than three dozen patients, witnesses and medical and humanitarian workers as well as Israeli officials.",
      "It found that Israel has presented little or even no evidence of a significant Hamas presence in those cases. The AP presented a dossier listing the incidents reported by those it interviewed to the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office. The office said it could not comment on specific events.",
      "The Israeli military has never made any claims of a Hamas presence at al-Awda. When asked what intelligence led troops to besiege and raid the hospital last year, the military spokesman\u2019s office did not reply.",
      "In recent weeks, the hospital has been paralyzed once again, with Israeli troops fighting in nearby Jabalia refugee camp and no food, water or medical supplies entering areas of northern Gaza. Its director Mohammed Salha said last month that the facility was surrounded by troops and was unable to evacuate six critical patients. Staff were down to eating one meal a day, usually just a flat bread or a bit of rice, he said.",
      "As war-wounded poured in, exhausted surgeons were struggling to treat them. No vascular surgeons or neurosurgeons remain north of Gaza City, so the doctors often resort to amputating shrapnel-shattered limbs to save lives.",
      "\u201cWe are reliving the nightmares of November and December of last year, but worse,\u201d Salha said. \u201cWe have fewer supplies, fewer doctors and less hope that anything will be done to stop this.\u201d",
      "The military, which did not respond to a specific request for comment on al-Awda hospital, says it takes all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties.",
      "Last year, fighting was raging around al-Awda when, on Nov. 21, a shell exploded in the facility's operating room. Dr. Mahmoud Abu Nujaila, two other doctors and a patient\u2019s uncle died almost instantly, according to international charity Doctors Without Borders, which said it had informed the Israeli military of its coordinates.",
      "Dr. Mohammed Obeid, Abu Nujaila\u2019s colleague, recalled dodging shellfire inside the hospital complex. Israeli sniper fire killed a nurse and two janitors and wounded a surgeon, hospital officials said.",
      "By Dec. 5, al-Awda was surrounded. For 18 days, coming or going became \u201ca death sentence,\u201d Obeid said.",
      "Survivors and hospital administrators recounted at least four occasions when Israeli drones or snipers killed or badly wounded Palestinians trying to enter. Two women about to give birth were shot and bled to death in the street, staff said. Salha, the administrator, watched gunfire kill his cousin, Souma, and her 6-year-old son as she brought the boy for treatment of wounds.",
      "Shaza al-Shuraim said labor pains left her no choice but to walk an hour to al-Awda to give birth. She, her mother-in-law and 16-year-old brother-in-law raised flags made of white blouses. \u201cCivilians!\u201d her mother-in-law, Khatam Sharir, kept shouting. Just outside the gate, a burst of gunfire answered, killing Sharir.",
      "On Dec. 23, troops stormed the hospital, ordering men ages 15 to 65 to strip and undergo interrogation in the yard. Mazen Khalidi, whose infected right leg had been amputated, said nurses pleaded with soldiers to let him rest rather than join the blindfolded and handcuffed men outside. They refused, and he hobbled downstairs, his stump bleeding.",
      "\u201cThe humiliation scared me more than death,\u201d Khalidi said.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Ahmed Muhanna, was seized by Israeli troops; his whereabouts remain unknown. One of Gaza\u2019s leading doctors, orthopedist Adnan al-Bursh, was also detained during the raid and died in Israeli custody in May.",
      "In the wreckage from the November shelling, staff found a message that Abu Nujaila had written on a whiteboard in the previous weeks.",
      "\u201cWhoever stays until the end will tell the story,\u201d it read in English. \u201cWe did what we could. Remember us.\u201d",
      "Several blocks away, on Oct. 18, artillery hit the upper floors of Indonesian Hospital, staff said. People fled for their lives. They'd already been surrounded by Israeli troops, leaving doctors and patients inside without enough food, water and supplies.",
      "\u201cThe bombing around us has increased. They\u2019ve paralyzed us,\" said Edi Wahyudi, an Indonesian volunteer.",
      "Two patients died because of a power outage and lack of supplies, said Muhannad Hadi, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator for Palestinian territories.",
      "Tamer al-Kurd, a nurse at the hospital, said around 44 patients and only two doctors remain. He said he was so dehydrated he was starting to hallucinate. \u201cPeople come to me to save them. \u2026 I can\u2019t do that by myself, with two doctors,\u201d he said in a voice message, his voice weak. \u201cI\u2019m tired.\u201d",
      "On Saturday, the Israeli military said it had facilitated the evacuation of 29 patients from Indonesian and al-Awda hospitals.",
      "The Indonesian is Northern Gaza\u2019s largest hospital. Today its top floors are charred, its walls pockmarked by shrapnel, its gates strewn with piled-up rubble \u2014 all the legacy of Israel's siege in the autumn of 2023.",
      "Before the assault, the Israeli army claimed an underground command-and-control center lay beneath the hospital. It released blurry satellite images of what it said was a tunnel entrance in the yard and a rocket launchpad nearby, outside the hospital compound.",
      "The Indonesia-based group that funds the hospital denied any Hamas presence. \u201cIf there\u2019s a tunnel, we would know. We know this building because we built it brick by brick, layer by layer. It\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Arief Rachman, a hospital manager from the Indonesia-based Medical Emergency Rescue Committee, told the AP last month.",
      "After besieging and raiding the hospital, the military did not mention or show evidence of the underground facility or tunnels it had earlier claimed. When asked if any tunnels were found, the military spokesman's office did not reply.",
      "It released images of two vehicles found in the compound \u2014 a pickup truck with military vests and a bloodstained car belonging to an abducted Israeli, suggesting he had been brought to the hospital on Oct. 7. Hamas has said it brought wounded hostages to hospitals for treatment.",
      "During the siege, Israeli shelling crept closer and closer until, on Nov. 20, it hit the Indonesian\u2019s second floor, killing 12 people and wounding dozens, according to staff. Israel said troops responded to \u201cenemy fire\u201d from the hospital but denied using shells.",
      "Gunfire over the next days hit walls and whizzed through intensive care. Explosions sparked fires outside the hospital courtyard where some 1,000 displaced Palestinians sheltered, according to staff. The Israeli military denied targeting the hospital, although it acknowledged nearby bombardment may have damaged it.",
      "For three weeks, wounded poured in \u2014 up to 500 a day to a facility with capacity for 200. Supplies hadn\u2019t entered in weeks. Bloodstained linens piled up. Doctors, some working 24-hour shifts, ate a few dates a day. The discovery of moldy flour on Nov. 23 was almost thrilling.",
      "Without medicines or ventilators, there was little doctors could do. Wounds became infected. Doctors said they performed dozens of amputations on infected limbs. Medics estimated a fifth of incoming patients died. At least 60 corpses lay in the courtyard. Others were buried beneath a nearby playground.",
      "\u201cTo see patients dying before your eyes because you don\u2019t have the ability to help them, you have to ask yourself: \u2018Where is humanity?\u2019\u201d asked Dergham Abu Ibrahim, a volunteer.",
      "Kamal Adwan Hospital, once a linchpin of northern Gaza\u2019s health system, was burning on Thursday of last week.",
      "Israeli shells crashed into the third floor, igniting a fire that destroyed medical supplies, according to the World Health Organization, which had delivered the equipment just days before. The artillery hit water tanks and damaged the dialysis unit, badly burning four medics who tried to extinguish the blaze, said the hospital\u2019s director, Hossam Abu Safiya.",
      "In videos pleading for help over the past weeks, Abu Safiya had fought to maintain his composure as Israeli forces surrounded the hospital. But last weekend, there were tears in his eyes.",
      "\u201cEverything we have built, they have burned,\u201d he said, his voice cracking. \u201cThey burned our hearts. They killed my son.\u201d",
      "On Oct. 25, Israeli troops stormed the hospital after what an Israeli military official described as an intense fight with militants nearby. During the battle, Israeli fire targeted the hospital\u2019s oxygen tanks because they \u201ccan be booby traps,\u201d the official said.",
      "Israeli forces withdrew after three days, during which Palestinian health officials said nearly all of Kamal Adwan's medical workers were detained, an Israeli drone killed at least one doctor and two children in intensive care died when generators stopped working.",
      "Days later, a drone struck Abu Safiya\u2019s son in nearby Jabalia. The 21-year-old had been wounded by Israeli snipers during the first military raid on Kamal Adwan last December. Now he is buried in the yard of the hospital, where just Abu Safiya and one other doctor remain to treat the dozens of wounded pouring in each day from new strikes in Jabalia.",
      "The Israeli military said troops detained 100 people, some who were \u201cposing as medical staff.\u201d Soldiers stripped the men to check for weapons, the military said, before those deemed militants were sent to detention camps. The military claimed that the hospital was \"fully operational, with all departments continuing to treat patients.\u201d It released footage of several guns and an RPG launcher with several rounds it said it found inside the hospital.",
      "Kamal Adwan staff say more than 30 medical personnel remain detained, including the head of nursing, who is employed by MedGlobal, an American organization that sends medical teams to disaster regions, and Dr. Mohammed Obeid, the surgeon employed by Doctors without Borders who previously worked at al-Awda Hospital and had moved to Kamal Adwan.",
      "The turmoil echoed Israel\u2019s nine-day siege of Kamal Adwan last December. On Dec. 12, soldiers entered and allowed police dogs to attack staff, patients and others, multiple witnesses said. Ahmed Atbail, a 36-year-old who had sought refuge at the hospital, said he saw a dog bite off one man\u2019s finger.",
      "Witnesses said the troops ordered boys and men, ranging from their mid-teens to 60, to line up outside crouched in the cold, blindfolded and nearly naked for hours of interrogation. \u201cEvery time someone lifted their heads, they were beaten,\u201d said Mohammed al-Masri, a lawyer who was detained.",
      "The military later published footage of men exiting the hospital. Al-Masri identified himself in the footage. He said soldiers staged the images, ordering men to lay down rifles belonging to the hospital guards as if they were militants surrendering. Israel said all photos released are authentic and that it apprehended dozens of suspected militants.",
      "As they released some of the men after interrogation, soldiers fired on them as they tried to reenter the hospital, wounding five, three detainees said. Ahmed Abu Hajjaj recalled hearing bursts of gunfire as he made his way back in the dark. \u201cI thought, this makes no sense \u2014 who would they be shooting at?\u201d",
      "Witnesses also said a bulldozer lumbered into the hospital compound, plowing into buildings. Abu Safiya, Abu Hajjaj and al-Masri described being held by soldiers inside the hospital as they heard people screaming outside.",
      "After the soldiers withdrew, the men saw the bulldozer had crushed tents that previously sheltered some 2,500 people. Most of the displaced had evacuated, but Abu Safiya said he found bodies of four people crushed, with splints from recent treatment in the hospital still on their limbs.",
      "Asked about the incident, the Israeli military spokesman\u2019s office said: \u201cLies were spread on social media\u201d about troops\u2019 activities at the hospital. It said bodies were discovered that had been buried previously, unrelated to the military\u2019s activities.",
      "Later, the military said Hamas used the hospital as a command center but produced no evidence. It said soldiers uncovered weapons, but it showed footage only of a single pistol.",
      "The hospital\u2019s director, Dr. Ahmed al-Kahlout, remains in Israeli custody. The military released footage of him under interrogation saying he was a Hamas agent and that militants were based in the hospital. His colleagues said he spoke under duress.",
      "Hagari, the military spokesperson, said hospitals \u201cprovide a life of their own ... to the (Hamas) war system.\u201d He said hospitals were linked to tunnels allowing fighters movement. \u201cAnd when you take it, they have no way to move. Not from the south to the north.\u201d",
      "Despite often suggesting hospitals are linked to Hamas' underground networks, the military has shown only one tunnel shaft from all the hospitals it raided \u2014 one leading to Shifa's grounds.",
      "In a report last month, a U.N. investigation commission determined that \u201cIsrael has implemented a concerted policy to destroy the health-care system of Gaza.\u201d It described Israeli actions at hospitals as \u201ccollective punishment against the Palestinians in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Some patients now fear hospitals, refusing to go to them or leaving before treatment is complete. \u201cThey are places of death,\u201d Ahmed al-Qamar, a 35-year-old economist in Jabalia refugee camp, said of his fear of taking his children to the hospital. \u201cYou can feel it.\u201d",
      "Zaher Sahloul, the president of MedGlobal who has also worked in Gaza during the war, said the sense of safety that should surround hospitals has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThis war has become a scar in the minds of every doctor and nurse.\u201d"

      "\u201cOn January 20, the Trump White House will advise all U.S\u200b. water systems to remove fluoride from public water,\u201d Kennedy wrote. Trump and his wife, Melania Trump, \u201cwant to Make America Healthy Again,\u201d he added, repeating a phrase Trump often uses and links to Kennedy.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday that he had not spoken to Kennedy about fluoride yet, \u201cbut it sounds OK to me. You know it\u2019s possible.\u201d",
      "The former president declined to say whether he would seek a Cabinet role for Kennedy, a job that would require Senate confirmation, but added, \"He\u2019s going to have a big role in the administration.\u201d",
      "Asked whether banning certain vaccines would be on the table, Trump said he would talk to Kennedy and others about that. Trump described Kennedy as \"a very talented guy and has strong views.\u201d",
      "The sudden and unexpected weekend social media post evoked the chaotic policymaking that defined Trump\u2019s White House tenure, when he would issue policy declarations on Twitter at virtually all hours. It also underscored the concerns many experts have about Kennedy, who has long promoted debunked theories about vaccine safety, having influence over U.S. public health.",
      "In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and continued to promote it even after fluoride toothpaste brands hit the market several years later. Though fluoride can come from a number of sources, drinking water is the main source for Americans, researchers say.",
      "Officials lowered their recommendation for drinking water fluoride levels in 2015 to address a tooth condition called fluorosis, that can cause splotches on teeth and was becoming more common in U.S. kids.",
      "In August, a federal agency determined \u201cwith moderate confidence\u201d that there is a link between higher levels of fluoride exposure and lower IQ in kids. The National Toxicology Program based its conclusion on studies involving fluoride levels at about twice the recommended limit for drinking water.",
      "A federal judge later cited that study in ordering the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to further regulate fluoride in drinking water. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen cautioned that it\u2019s not certain that the amount of fluoride typically added to water is causing lower IQ in kids, but he concluded that mounting research points to an unreasonable risk that it could be. He ordered the EPA to take steps to lower that risk, but didn\u2019t say what those measures should be.",
      "In his X post Saturday, Kennedy tagged Michael Connett, the lead attorney representing the plaintiff in that lawsuit, the environmental advocacy group Food & Water Watch.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s anti-vaccine organization has a lawsuit pending against news organizations including The Associated Press, accusing them of violating antitrust laws by taking action to identify misinformation, including about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy is on leave from the group but is listed as one of its attorneys in the lawsuit.",
      "What role Kennedy might hold if Trump wins on Tuesday remains unclear. Kennedy recently told NewsNation that Trump asked him to \u201creorganize\u201d agencies including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration and some agencies under the Department of Agriculture.",
      "But for now, the former independent presidential candidate has become one of Trump's top surrogates. Trump frequently mentions having the support of Kennedy, a scion of a Democratic dynasty and the son of former Attorney General Robert Kennedy and nephew of President John F. Kennedy.",
      "Kennedy traveled with Trump Friday and spoke at his rallies in Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Trump said Saturday that he told Kennedy: \u201cYou can work on food, you can work on anything you want\" except oil policy.",
      "\u201cHe wants health, he wants women\u2019s health, he wants men\u2019s health, he wants kids, he wants everything,\" Trump added."

    "summary": "An amendment to New York&rsquo;s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including &ldquo;gender identity&rdquo; and &ldquo;pregnancy outcomes.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution could bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes.\u201d",
      "ALBANY, N.Y. -- An amendment to New York\u2019s constitution that would bar discrimination based on things including \u201cgender identity\u201d and \u201cpregnancy outcomes\" is up for a final vote Tuesday amid debate over how much it might affect future abortion and transgender rights.",
      "Supporters and opponents disagree sharply about the potential legal impact of the Equal Rights Amendment, also known as Proposition 1.",
      "New York\u2019s constitution currently forbids discrimination based on race, creed or religion. The amendment would add language that says someone cannot be denied civil rights because of their national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes or \u201creproductive healthcare and autonomy.\u201d",
      "Democratic leaders put the amendment on the ballot partly in hopes of boosting turnout by voters passionate about protecting abortion access, in an election year where U.S. House races in New York could help decide which party controls Congress.",
      "Several other states also have abortion-related constitutional amendments on their ballots Tuesday. Most of those ballot questions address head-on when it should be legal to end a pregnancy. But in New York, state lawmakers took the indirect approach of writing the amendment as an antidiscrimination measure.",
      "Democrats who support the amendment have argued that the new language would create a legal framework where any restrictions on abortion would amount to an unconstitutional form of discrimination in medical care. The New York City Bar Association has agreed with that assessment, as have some other legal experts.",
      "Still, the fact that the amendment itself does not use the word abortion has caused headaches for its supporters. It also opened the door for opponents to claim its other language would lead to a raft of unintended consequences.",
      "Republicans have run a strong messaging campaign against the amendment, choosing not to focus on what protections it might provide for abortion, but to target other parts of the proposal. Their main attack line has been to argue the amendment would provide a constitutional right for transgender athletes to play on girls\u2019 sports teams.",
      "They\u2019ve also argued that its language on national origin could result in noncitizens being allowed to vote, that its ban on age discrimination might take away price discounts for senior citizens, and that it could also wind up stopping parents from having a say in their child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Previous state court decisions have found that existing language in the state constitution bars noncitizens from voting. And the New York City Bar Association says the amendment would not block existing state laws requiring parental consent for a child\u2019s medical care.",
      "Legal battles are already underway in New York over whether existing state and federal laws give transgender people the right to play on sports teams that match the gender identity.",
      "Democrats in the state legislature voted to put the amendment on the 2024 ballot after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters elsewhere have shown support for abortion access in previous elections. An Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll recently found that 7 in 10 Americans think abortion should be legal in all or most cases.",
      "Uncertainty over the New York amendment\u2019s impact on abortion was pronounced enough, however, that it caused even the state Board of Elections to throw up its hands. The board is responsible for writing simple explanations of proposed amendments that voters will see on their ballots. But rather than interpret the measure or include the word abortion in its description, the board decided to reiterate the amendment\u2019s language verbatim.",
      "Supporters of the amendment objected and filed lawsuit, but the judge in the case, David A. Weinstein, eventually declined to make the board rewrite its description, in part because he could not say for certain how courts would interpret the amendment\u2019s language.",
      "Abortion is currently legal in New York up through 24 weeks from the beginning of pregnancy. After that, it is only legal if the pregnant person\u2019s life, physical health or mental health is at risk, or if a medical provider determines the fetus is not viable. Although there is no defined time frame, viability is a term used by health care providers to describe whether a pregnancy is expected to continue developing normally or whether a fetus might survive outside the uterus.",
      "Democrats have firm control of state government in New York, making any new abortion restrictions unlikely in the near future.",
      "Backers of the proposal argue that if the amendment passes it would create a strong layer of abortion protections in New York that would be difficult for a future legislature to repeal. That's because New York requires the legislature to pass an amendment to the constitution two times before it goes to voters for final approval."

      "Mozambique armed forces spokesperson Gen. Omar Saranga made the announcement at a late-night press conference on Thursday, saying the army would support police in keeping order. Soldiers had already been deployed when he made the announcement, Saranga said.",
      "The country of 34 million people in southern Africa is on edge, with the presidential palace under heavy guard and security forces constantly patrolling the streets. Many people are locking themselves in their homes.",

      "The ruling Frelimo party's candidate, Daniel Chapo, was declared the winner of the presidential election two weeks ago, continuing the leftist party's dominance of Mozambican politics since independence from Portugal in 1975.",
      "Opposition parties have accused Frelimo of stuffing ballot boxes and other election fraud, while international observers said there were problems with the vote and it was not free and fair. Frelimo has often been accused of rigging national and local elections to keep power. The Constitutional Council has not yet validated the results of the election, which it must do for them to be recognized.",
      "Current President Filipe Nyusi of Frelimo is stepping down after serving the two terms allowed under the constitution.",

Police have been accused by rights groups of firing live bullets at peaceful demonstrations and at least 20 people have been killed by security forces, according to international groups. Mozambican rights groups say the death toll is much higher.",
      "Anger also swelled after two senior opposition figures \u2014 a lawyer and a party spokesperson \u2014 were killed by unidentified gunmen, who ambushed them in their car and fired at least 25 rounds at them, according to their party.",
      "The regional Southern African Development Community has called a special summit for later this month, when Mozambique will be high on the agenda. Neighboring South Africa has closed its main border crossing with Mozambique and heightened security on its side.",

      "The U.S. military acknowledged the videos circulating online showing what appeared to be a flaming aircraft dropping out of the sky and a field of burning debris in what those off-camera described as an area of Yemen's al-Jawf province. The military said it was investigating the incident, declining to elaborate further.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear what kind of aircraft was shot down in the low-quality night video. The Houthis, in a later statement, claimed to have downed an American MQ-9 Reaper drone.",
      "The Houthis have surface-to-air missiles \u2014 such as the Iranian missile known as the 358 \u2014 capable of downing aircraft. Iran denies arming the rebels, though Tehran-manufactured weaponry has been found on the battlefield and in sea shipments heading to Yemen for the Shiite Houthi rebels despite a United Nations arms embargo.",

      "Since Houthis seized the country\u2019s north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the rebels have shot down MQ-9 Reaper drones in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military has declined to offer a total figure for the number of drones it has lost during that time.",
      "Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes up to 50,000 feet (15,240 meters) and have an endurance of up to 24 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years.",
      "The Houthis have targeted more than 90 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels.",
      "The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel\u2019s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of the Houthi sea attacks also has waxed and waned over the months.",

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "SHENGJIN, Albania -- An Italian navy ship docked Friday at the Albanian port of Shengjin with eight migrants who will be processed there after they were intercepted in international waters, a month after another group was turned away for failing the vetting process.",
      "It is only the second transfer of migrants since two migrant processing centers started operating in October under a deal sealed between Italy and Albania.",
      "The agreement allows up to 3,000 migrants intercepted by the Italian coast guard in international waters each month will be sheltered in Albania, and vetted for possible asylum in Italy or be sent back to their countries.",
      "Italy has agreed to welcome those migrants who are granted asylum, while those whose applications are rejected face deportation directly from Albania.",
      "The same Italian naval ship used on Friday transferred the first 16 migrants to Albania from Bangladesh and Egypt on Oct. 16. Four were taken to Italy the same day because they were minors or had health issues. Twelve others were brought back to Italy three days later, following a ruling by Rome judges who rejected their detention because their countries of origin weren't safe enough for them to be sent back.",
      "The naval ship Libra, which can carry 200 people besides crew, left Italy\u2019s southernmost island of Lampedusa on Wednesday with eight men on board, according to the Italian media. Italian Interior Ministry spokesperson Francesco Kamel had confirmed the Libra was heading to Albania, but declined to give out any further information until the operation was complete. He didn't say when it would arrive, nor how many people were on board.",
      "Eight migrants in black-and-purple sportswear were seen walking out of the ship, accompanied by Italian Carabinieri, police and other officials at the reception center. After being screened there, they will be taken to the Gjader center, about 22 kilometers (14 miles) to the east.",
      "The Italian media reported that out of 1,200 migrant arrivals on Lampedusa over the past two days, just eight male adults traveling without families met Albania's screening criteria, including that they come from countries deemed \u201csafe\u201d for repatriation.",
      "There is no clarification from the Italian Interior Ministry on the nationality of the migrants. Nongovernmental organizations refer to them as coming from Bangladesh and Egypt.",
      "The number of people reaching Italy along the central Mediterranean migration route \u2014 mainly from Bangladesh, Syria, Tunisia and Egypt \u2014 has fallen by 60% in 2024 compared to 2023. As of Nov. 7, according to the Italian Interior Ministry, 57,767 migrants have arrived by sea in 2024.",
      "A court ruling out of Rome had shortened the list of countries considered \u201csafe\u201d by law, meaning that Rome can repatriate migrants from those countries who didn\u2019t win asylum using a fast-track procedure. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni slammed the Rome court ruling, and said that deeming countries such as Bangladesh and Egypt unsafe means that virtually all migrants would be barred from the Albania program, making it unworkable.",
      "On Oct. 21, Italy\u2019s far-right government approved a new decree aimed at overcoming those judicial hurdles that risked derailing the contentious five-year migration deal with Albania, signed in 2023 by Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama.",
      "The agreement to outsource the housing of asylum-seekers to a non-European Union member country, defended by Meloni as a new model to handle illegal migration, has been hailed by some countries which like Italy are experiencing a high level of migrant arrivals.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still an extraordinary interest and some positive attention (on the Albanian migration deal) and there was also a bit of curiosity on this debate over safe countries,\u201d Meloni on Friday told reporters in Budapest during the European Political Community summit.",

      "Reports of antisemitic speech, vandalism and violence have been on the rise in Europe since the start of the war in Gaza, and tensions mounted in Amsterdam ahead of Thursday night\u2019s match between the Dutch team Ajax and Maccabi Tel Aviv.",
      "Pro-Palestinian demonstrators were banned by local authorities from gathering outside the stadium, and video showed a large crowd of Israeli fans chanting anti-Arab slogans on their way to the game. Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot crisscrossed the city in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade police, Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema said.",
      "On the social media platform Telegram, \u201cthere is talk of people going on a Jew hunt,\" Halsema said. \"That is so shocking and so despicable that I still cannot fathom it.\u201d Dutch Minister of Justice and Security David van Weel vowed to track down and prosecute the perpetrators.",
      "Police had to escort some fans back to hotels, according to authorities.",
      "Ofek Ziv, a Maccabi fan from the Israeli city of Petah Tikva, said someone threw a rock at his head, causing light bleeding, as he and a friend left the stadium. He said a group of men began to chase him, before he and his friend got into a taxi, picked up other fans and took shelter at a hotel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very scared, it\u2019s very striking,\" Ziv said. \"And the police didn\u2019t come to help us.\u201d",
      "Another Israeli fan, Alyia Cohen, said upon arriving back in Israel that he would go back to Amsterdam for future matches. \u201cWe are not afraid of anything, ours is the people of Israel.\u201d",
      "Five people were treated in the hospital and released, while some 20 to 30 people suffered light injuries, police said. At least 62 suspects were arrested, with 10 still in custody, the city's public prosecutor, Ren\u00e9 de Beukelaer, told reporters at a news conference Friday.",
      "A statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office said he \u201cviews the horrifying incident with utmost gravity.\u201d He demanded that the Dutch government take \u201cvigorous and swift action\u201d against those involved.",
      "Condemnation of the violence poured in from around Europe. \u201cAntisemitism has absolutely no place in Europe, and we are determined to fight it and to fight all forms of hatred,\u201d said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. \"We want Jewish life and culture to thrive in Europe.\u201d",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof condemned the violence and flew home early from a European Union summit in Hungary.",
      "The attacks shattered Amsterdam\u2019s long-cherished view of itself as a beacon of tolerance and haven for persecuted religions, including Sephardic Jews from Portugal and Spain who fled to the city centuries ago.",
      "Police said security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions across the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.",
      "Halsema, Amsterdam's mayor, described the violence as \u201can eruption of antisemitism that we had hoped never again to see in Amsterdam.\u201d",
      "In the past, Ajax was known as a soccer club with links to Amsterdam\u2019s Jewish community because visiting fans had to pass the city\u2019s Jewish quarter to get to the club\u2019s former stadium. Ajax fans sometimes wave Star of David flags and chant the Dutch word for Jews.",
      "Israel's foreign minister, Gideon Saar, flew to Amsterdam on Friday and in a message on X he said that hatred of Jews is \u201cappearing in place after place after place.\"",
      "Saar met with the Dutch minister for security and justice, pledging Israeli help in the investigation, and also held talks with Geert Wilders, a far right, anti-Islam lawmaker whose party won national elections last year.",
      "Amsterdam police spokeswoman Sara Tillart said it was too early in their investigation to say if anybody other than soccer fans was targeted. Authorities outlawed demonstrations across the city for the weekend and gave police extra powers to frisk people.",
      "Israel\u2019s government initially ordered two planes sent to Amsterdam to bring fans home, but Netanyahu's office later said it would work to help citizens arrange commercial flights.",
      "Maccabi\u2019s CEO, Ben Mansford, spoke to reporters at Israel\u2019s international airport as some fans returned. \u201cLots of people went to watch a football game ... to support Israel, to support the star of David,\u201d he said. For them to be attacked, \u201cthat\u2019s very sad times for us all given the last year we\u2019ve had.\u201d",
      "Tensions had been brewing in Amsterdam for days ahead of the match. A Palestinian flag was torn down from a building in Amsterdam on Wednesday, Dutch broadcaster NOS reported, and authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the stadium.",
      "Ahead of the game, large crowds of supporters of the Israeli team could be seen on video chanting anti-Arab slogans as they headed to the stadium, escorted by police.",
      "\u201cLet the IDF win, and (expletive) the Arabs,\u201d the fans chanted, using the acronym of the Israeli military, as they shook their fists. It also showed police pushing several pro-Palestinian protesters away from a Maccabi fan gathering in a square earlier in the day.",
      "Security issues around hosting games against visiting Israeli teams led the Belgian soccer federation to decline to stage a men\u2019s Nations League game in September. That game against Israel was played in Hungary with no fans in the stadium.",
      "Israel was exiled from the Asian Football Confederation in the 1970s after Arab nations refused to play against it. Israel played in European qualifying for the 1982 World Cup and has been a member of European soccer body UEFA since 1994.",
      "The violence in Amsterdam will no doubt lead to a review of security at upcoming matches involving Israeli teams. UEFA had announced Monday that a Maccabi match initially to be played in Istanbul on Nov. 28 against the Turkish team Besiktas, would be moved to a yet-to-be-decided neutral venue.",
      "Italian police said security was increased for Maccabi Tel Aviv\u2019s basketball game at Virtus Bologna Friday night, both for fans and for the Maccabi team.",
      "Israel\u2019s national soccer team is scheduled to play France in Paris on Nov. 14 in the Nations League. French Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said Friday the match would go ahead as planned.",
      "\u201cI think that for a symbolic reason we must not yield, we must not give up,\u201d he said, noting that sports fans from around the world came together for the Paris Olympics this year to celebrate the \u201cuniversal values\u201d of sports.",

      "Many in Israel view Gallant as the sole moderate voice in a far-right government, and see his removal as a sign that Netanyahu has lost interest in returning hostages still held in Gaza. Katz currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister.",

      "The Israeli military says it will allow 300 truckloads of humanitarian aid supplied by the United Arab Emirates to enter the Gaza Strip in the coming days. That\u2019s less than the 350 trucks per day that the United States said it wants to see enter the war-ravaged territory.",

Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to congratulate Trump, lavishing praise on the former president who during his first term established a record of staunch support for Israel.",
      "Trump\u2019s election victory \u2014 which many Israelis praised as a win for their country \u2014 has cast uncertainty on the future of diplomatic efforts to end the Israel-Hamas war. Any proposed deal would also see Hamas release the remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza who were abducted in the group\u2019s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians.",

It says food, aid, and fuel will soon be able to be delivered through the crossing, but did not say when it will open nor if aid will be delivered to north of Gaza, where the United Nations and aid groups say the humanitarian situation is most dire.",
      "Since Israeli forces unleashed a fierce offensive on north Gaza in early October, no aid has made it to the northernmost reaches of the territory, where the U.N. says roughly 70,000 Palestinians still remain.",
      "The opening of the crossing likely reflects an Israeli desire to ramp up aid ahead of a United States-imposed deadline. In an Oct. 13 letter sent to Israeli officials, American officials said Israel had 30 days to increase the daily number of aid trucks entering the Gaza Strip to 350 or risk the U.S. reconsidering arms shipments to Israel \u2014 which have been key to Israel\u2019s war against Hamas militants in Gaza.",

      "Israel Katz, his replacement, currently serves as foreign minister and is a longtime Netanyahu loyalist and veteran Cabinet minister. Katz thanked Gallant and said the war\u2019s objectives were to \u201cstop Iranian aggression and deny its capabilities, continue dismantling Hamas as a governing and military force, and defeat Hezbollah.\u201d He added that returning the hostages was a top \u201cmoral priority.\u201d",

Local media gave his name as Fernando Guerrero Alc\u00e1ntar, but a navy spokesman would not confirm that, or whether he was in uniform at the time.",

Black candles burn on top of an altar decorated with chalices and knives. The members of the Temple of Satan are about to start a ritual.",
      "Five years after the Satanic Temple of the United States made headlines \u2014 and unleashed a wave of panic \u2014 when it was designated a church, a similar organization in Chile, a conservative country where\u202fhalf of its population of 18 million identifies as Catholic, is asking the government to recognize them legally as a religious association.",
      "Scholars, believers and residents consulted by The Associated Press note that Chile, where a long-lasting tradition of Catholicism has played a leading role in public discussions, is experiencing a crisis of faith, following revelations of multiple sexual abuse scandals within the Catholic church over the years.",
      "\u201cThese types of organizations now feel that they have greater support to challenge what was virtually impossible before,\u201d said Luis Bahamondes, a professor at the Center for Judaic Studies at the University of Chile. And that\u2019s because, \u201cuntil very recently, the Catholic Church enjoyed an unprecedented power. It had an opinion on everything: politics, economics, geopolitics, sexuality and education.\u201d",
      "Despite its name, The Temple of Satan: Satanists and Luciferians of Chile does not embark on sacrifices nor asks its congregants to worship the devil. Among its 100 members are people who work as publicists, firefighters, police officers, lawyers and psychologists, who have found in the organization a way to defy moral norms, dogmas and religious impositions.",
      "While they embrace the term Satanist, they don\u2019t revere or believe in Satan. Instead, they worship rationality, individualism, pleasure and the mundane life.",
      "Rather than gods, they praise humankind.",
      "\u201cYou are the owner of your present and future, there is no God that makes decisions for you,\u201d said Haborym, a spokesperson for the group, during a walk through tombs and mausoleums at the General Cemetery of Santiago.

    "story": [
      "Israeli residents of a settlement named after Donald Trump hope his return to office will breathe new life into their tiny community in the Golan Heights",
      "RAMAT TRUMP, Golan Heights -- Israeli residents of \u201cTrump Heights\u201d are welcoming the election of their namesake, hoping Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency will breathe new life into this tiny, remote settlement in the central Golan Heights.",
      "During his first term, Trump became the first and only foreign leader to recognize Israel\u2019s control of the Golan, which it seized from Syria in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel thanked him by rebranding this outpost after him.",
      "But a large-scale influx of new residents never materialized after that 2019 ceremony, and just a couple dozen families live in Trump Heights, or \u201cRamat Trump\u201d in Hebrew. Job opportunities are limited, and Israel\u2019s more than yearlong war against Hezbollah militants in nearby Lebanon has added to the sense of isolation.",
      "Trump\u2019s election has inspired hope in the community that it will attract more members and also more funding for security improvements.",
      "\u201cMaybe it can raise more awareness and maybe some support to help here and help our kids here,\u201d said Yarden Freimann, Trump Heights\u2019 community manager.",
      "Ori Kallner, head of the Golan\u2019s regional council, showed off dozens of plots of land, replete with new asphalt roads, lampposts and utility lines, that residents have prepared for future housing developments.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s return to the White House definitely puts the town in the headlines,\u201d he said.",
      "Kallner stood next to a metal statue of an eagle and a menorah, symbolizing the United States and Israel, as Israeli warplanes flew overhead. Two explosions from rockets fired from Lebanon punched the hills nearby, and just across the border in Lebanon, plumes of smoke rose into the air from Israeli airstrikes.",
      "An enormous sign with the settlement\u2019s name in Hebrew and English gleamed in the sun, while two large sunbaked metal flags of Israel and the United States were faded almost beyond recognition.",
      "Surrounded by ashen ruins of villages fled by Syrians in the 1967 war, the town is perched above the Hula Valley, where Israel has amassed tanks, artillery and troops for its fight in Lebanon. Most towns in the valley have been evacuated. Trump Heights sends its kids to a makeshift daycare in a nearby settlement after the government shuttered all schools in the region in the wake of the Oct. 1 invasion of Lebanon.",
      "\u201cWe find ourselves hanging by our fingernails to be in our own community, not be evacuated, and on the other hand, we cannot work, we cannot send our kids to any kind of an education system,\u201d said Freimann.",
      "Trump Heights is only about 7 miles (12 kilometers) from Lebanon and Syria. Alerts for incoming fire gives residents about 30 seconds' head start to get to a bomb shelter.",
      "Israel annexed the Golan, a strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel, in 1981 in a move that is not internationally recognized.",
      "That changed in March 2019 when Trump, without notice, tweeted that the U.S. would \u201cfully recognize\u201d Israel\u2019s control of the territory. His announcement drew widespread condemnation from the international community, which considers the Golan to be occupied Syrian territory and Israel\u2019s settlements to be illegal. The Biden administration left the decision intact, but the U.S. remains the lone country to recognize the Israeli annexation.",
      "Kallner said he hopes Trump will now persuade European countries to recognize Israeli sovereignty there.",
      "According to Israeli figures, the Golan is home to about 50,000 people \u2014 roughly half of them Jewish Israelis and the other half Arab Druze, many of whom still consider themselves Syrians under occupation.",
      "Israel has encouraged and promoted settlements in the Golan, and the Druze residents operate farms and a tourism and restaurant sector popular with Israelis. But the area has struggled to develop because of its remoteness, several hours from Israel\u2019s economic center in Tel Aviv.",
      "That economic hardship has only worsened during the war as the hospitality sector cratered. On July 28, a rocket killed 12 Druze children on a soccer field in the city of Majdal Shams, about 12 miles (20 kilometers) away. Israel invaded Lebanon months later.",
      "In June 2019, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu led an inauguration ceremony for Trump Heights. The U.S. ambassador at the time, David Friedman, noted that the ceremony came days after Trump\u2019s birthday and said: \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more appropriate and a more beautiful birthday present.\u201d",
      "The Golan recognition was among a series of diplomatic gifts that Trump delivered to Israel during his first term. They included recognizing Jerusalem as Israel\u2019s capital and moving the American embassy to the contested city, and a series of diplomatic agreements with Arab countries known as the Abraham Accords.",
      "He has vowed to bring peace to the tumultuous region during his second term, but has not said how.",
      "Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump during his first term but ran afoul of the former president when he congratulated Joe Biden on his 2020 victory. The Israeli prime minister announced Tuesday that he was one of the first foreign leaders to call the president-elect and congratulate him on his victory. An official in his office, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal communications, said aides were upbeat and giddy.",
      "\u201cCongratulations on history\u2019s greatest comeback!\u201d the Israeli leader said in a statement. \u201cYour historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America.\u201d",
      "At Trump Heights, Kallner was optimistic too: \u201cThe Golan community is strong and resilient, and people that want to come and live here are from the same material. I believe we will overcome these challenging times and won\u2019t stop growing.\u201d"

      "Two suspected militants and two members of a government-sponsored militia have been killed in two separate incidents in Indian-controlled Kashmir",
      "NEW DELHI -- Two suspected militants were killed in a gunfight with government forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said Friday, while assailants killed two members of a government-sponsored militia elsewhere in the disputed region.",
      "The region, divided between India and Pakistan but claimed by both in its entirety, has experienced an increase in violence in recent months.",
      "The Indian military said a joint team of soldiers and police raided a village near northwestern Sopore town late Thursday following a tip about the presence of a group of militants.",
      "The militants \u201cfired indiscriminately\u201d at the troops, leading to a gunbattle in which two were killed, the military said in a statement.",
      "Troops were continuing to search the area, it said. There was no independent confirmation of the incident.",
      "Meanwhile, assailants killed two members of a government-run militia called the \u201cVillage Defense Group\u201d in the remote southern Kishtwar area late Thursday, officials said.",
      "Police blamed rebels fighting against Indian rule in Kashmir for the killings.",
      "The two, one of them a Hindu and another Muslim, were abducted from a forested area where they had gone to graze cattle on Thursday.",
      "On Friday, hundreds of people at several places in Kishtwar and Jammu district took to the streets in protest at the killings, demanding the authorities arrest the culprits. Kishtwar also observed a shutdown on the instruction of a Hindu group, the Sanatan Dharam Sabha.",
      "The Village Defense Group was initially formed in the 1990s to protect remote Himalayan villages against anti-India insurgents when government forces could not reach them quickly. As the insurgency waned in their areas and as some militia members gained notoriety for brutality and rights violations, the militia was largely disbanded.",
      "However last year, after the killing of seven Hindus in two attacks in a remote mountainous village near the highly militarized Line of Control that divides Kashmir between India and Pakistan, authorities revived the militia and began rearming and training thousands of villagers, including some teenagers.",
      "The Kashmir Tigers, which Indian officials say is an offshoot of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad militant group, claimed responsibility for the killings of the two in a statement on social media. The insurgent group also released photos of the two bloodied bodies.",
      "The statement could not be independently verified.",
      "Chief Minister Omar Abdullah condemned the attack. \u201cI expect the security forces to move quickly to plug any gaps in our counter-terror grid & ensure that attacks like this stop completely,\u201d he wrote on social medial platform X.",
      "Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi\u2019s rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels\u2019 goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country.",
      "India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict."

      "A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste has been allowed to dock at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection",
      "TIRANA, Albania -- A ship suspected of carrying a large amount of hazardous waste was allowed to dock on Friday at Albania\u2019s main port, where its cargo was being unloaded for inspection on the orders of the prosecutor, officials said.",
      "Albania had prevented the Turkish-flagged Moliva XA443A from docking early last week at the port of Durres, 33 kilometers (20 miles) west of the capital, Tirana, after a watchdog alerted authorities that it was carrying hazardous waste.",
      "Instead, the ship was kept at an anchorage place away from the port.",
      "The prosecutors then ordered the containers to be seized and stored \u201cat an environmentally\" safe place. Once unloaded, the containers are expected to be sent to an agency in Porto Romano, 6 kilometers (4 miles) away, for inspection.",
      "The prosecutor\u2019s office has asked different institutions to conduct lab tests of the cargo.",
      "The Seattle-based non-government organization Basel Action Network, or BAN, which focuses on environmental issues, flagged the ship to authorities in August after receiving information from a whistleblower that the containers on board are suspected to be carrying an estimated 2,100 tons of toxic dust from pollution control filters from the steel industry.",
      "The dust is suspected to have originated at an Albanian company and that it was also illegally smuggled to Albania from neighboring Kosovo and Germany.",
      "BAN said the containers left Durres on July 4 on two Maersk-chartered ships with the intended destination of Thailand. The group said it alerted several transit countries and collaborated with EARTH, a Thai environmental organization, and together raised the alarm about the shipment.",
      "Thailand refused to accept the shipment, asking authorities in Singapore to stop it. The ships then docked at a Turkish port and the containers were loaded on the Turkish-flagged ship, which briefly stopped at the Italian port of Gioia Tauro before going to Albania, BAN said.",

      "The case against Dr. Nadezhda Buyanova, 68, is one of hundreds launched against Russians after Moscow launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, and unleashed an unprecedented crackdown on opposition activists, independent journalists and ordinary people.",
      "Buyanova was arrested in February and initially released on condition of complying with certain restrictions, but two months later authorities placed her in pre-trial detention, arguing that she violated some of the restrictions. The mother of one of her patients reported her to the authorities, alleging that the pediatrician told her son that his father, a Russian soldier killed in Ukraine, was a legitimate target for Kyiv's troops, and blamed Russia for the war.",
      "The pediatrician was charged with spreading false information about the army, a criminal offense under a law that was adopted shortly after the invasion and widely used to target critics and protesters. She has rejected the charges and insisted that she never said those things.",
      "Buyanova's defense argued that the prosecution failed to present evidence that the purported conversation took place and alleged that the woman who reported the doctor, who was born in the Ukrainian city of Lviv, fabricated the story out of animosity towards Ukrainians, according to Mediazona.",
      "In her closing statement to the court, Buyanova said that it was \u201cpainful\u201d to read the accusations in the indictment, and broke down in tears.",

      "LONDON -- Ireland's President Michael Higgins dissolved Parliament Friday, clearing the way for a Nov. 29 election that will determine who controls government.",
      "Prime Minister Simon Harris, who had until March to call an election, had announced the date Wednesday.",
      "A historic coalition government led by Harris' center-right Fine Gael party and its center-left rival Fianna Fail has been in power since the 2020 race ended in a virtual dead heat.",
      "\u201cWe did not agree on every issue but we did always work hard and together for the good of the Irish people,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThe time is now right to ask the Irish people to give a new mandate.\u201d",
      "Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, which arose from opposing sides of Ireland\u2019s 1920s civil war, shared a broadly centrist outlook and had alternated holding power to govern Ireland over the decades. The two set aside their differences in 2020 to work together, bringing the Green Party along as a junior partner.",
      "Fianna Fail leader Miche\u00e1l Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael\u2019s Leo Varadkar in December 2022.",
      "Harris took over when Varadkar stepped down earlier this year.",
      "The left-wing nationalist Sinn Fein party had won the largest share of votes in the election but was shut out of government because it couldn't assemble enough support to govern. Sinn Fein has been shunned by centrist parties because of its historic links to the nationalist militants of the Irish Republican Army and decades of violence in Northern Ireland.",
      "Sinn Fein said it was fielding more candidates in its effort to lead the government.",
      "\u201cAfter a century of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael, it is time to make that change, to give Sinn Fein the chance to lead and the chance to deliver,\u201d said party President Mary-Lou McDonald. \u201cIn Sinn Fein you will get a government that will move heaven and earth to make housing affordable, to bring home ownership back into the reach of working people and to restore hope for a generation.\u201d",
      "Ireland, which has a population of 5.2 million, has faced many of the same challenges of other countries since its last election: the COVID-19 pandemic, economic disruptions due to the war in Ukraine and a surge of migrants from overseas.",
      "Martin said the next five years would be challenging for the Irish economy, noting the impact from global conflicts and a potential change in U.S. trade policy change.",
      "\u201cThe greatest threat to the Irish economy is external, and we need experience and we need leadership that has already demonstrated its capacity to weather significant events and shocks to lead us through the next challenging five years,\u201d Martin said.",
      "Harris said the coalition had protected people during coronavirus, supported Ukraine in its war and weathered the cost-of-living crisis.",
      "Housing, immigration and childcare are some of the main issues for voters, he said.",
      "He said he was pleased the government had set aside money to weather any future trade shocks.",
      "\u201cWe used to be ridiculed for this,\u201d Harris said. \"This is exactly why we have the buffer that is there, is a trans-Atlantic shock or indeed any other shock to our economy, my children will never have to experience the austerity that our generation did.\u201d",
      "Ireland in 2010 faced national bankruptcy over the cost of saving its failing banks. It adopted an austerity program as one of the conditions for an international bailout but rebounded strongly after exiting the bailout in 2013."

      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",

      "More than 2% of Kenya's population lives with a disability, and it often affects mobility",
      "NAIROBI, Kenya -- Caroline Mwikali lost her ability to walk at age 13 after an illness. She quickly learned how difficult it is to get around in Kenya\u2019s busy capital, Nairobi.",
      "Mwikali, who now works at a car financing company, said public transport is not designed to accommodate wheelchair users like her.",
      "Nairobi's most popular modes of transport include motorbikes along with minivans and minibuses that are not fitted with ramps. They also are not designed to fit wheelchairs in their aisles, so users must be hoisted up the stairs and placed on regular seats while their wheelchairs are put with luggage.",
      "\u201cIn most cases, the people manning the bus terminals have to lift you off the wheelchair to help you board the buses. This is not only uncomfortable but leaves you attracting unnecessary attention from the public,\u201d Mwikali told The Associated Press.",
      "She is among 2.2% of Kenya\u2019s population, or about 900,000 people, who live with a disability. The most common type of disability is mobility-related at 42%.",
      "One entrepreneur, Daniel Gatura, founded Ace Mobility in Nairobi in 2021. Its vehicles are modified with ramps and swivel seats to accommodate people with disabilities and anyone else who needs support commuting.",
      "Gatura said he was inspired by a personal experience growing up.",
      "\u201cMy father sustained a spinal cord injury in an accident that left him in a wheelchair when he was just 5 years old. I witnessed the challenges my father faced, including losing his job due to transportation issues,\u201d Gatura said.",
      "Users can book rides through the Ace Mobility app. Drivers are trained as caregivers, ensuring they understand how to provide respectful and appropriate assistance to passengers with disabilities.",
      "Gatura said they have 5,000 users.",
      "\u201cWe are changing the narrative around disability and reduced mobility. Just because you have a disability doesn\u2019t mean you cannot earn for yourself; it doesn\u2019t mean you are a nobody in the society,\u201d he said.",
      "The transport is more expensive than public transport, charging the equivalent of $1 per kilometer (0.6 miles). The same amount can be used to pay for a 40-kilometer (24-mile) ride in public transport vehicles. But Gatura noted it delivers people directly to their homes.",
      "\u201cI find the charges quite fair considering the convenience that it offers. I get to travel comfortably and without necessarily moving from my chair. It also somehow preserves my dignity,\u201d said Mwikali, who has used the service for four months after a referral from a former classmate.",
      "But others like Cindy Cherotich can't afford the service. She must jostle for space on minibuses while on crutches.",
      "\u201cWhen I go to the bus station sometimes the public vehicles do not allow me to board,\" she said. \u201cWhen they see my crutch and (see) somebody who is OK without crutches, they will let them in and I will be left.\u201d",
      "Lucy Nkatha, a disability advocate and coordinator of Kiengu Women Challenged to Challenge Group, an NGO, said she had never heard of Ace Mobility and called for marketing support for such companies.",
      "\u201cIt should also be made affordable,\u201d she said.",
      "Sandra Nyawira, the disability inclusion adviser at United Disabled Persons of Kenya, noted that Kenya has a number of policies in place to address accommodations for people with disabilities, but implementation is rare. She called for more political will.",

      "As Germany celebrates the fall of the Berlin Wall 35 years ago on Nov. 9 1989, women look back at how different their lives were under communism in East and capitalism in West Germany",
      "BERLIN -- Like many other young women living in communist East Germany, Solveig Leo thought nothing about juggling work and motherhood. The mother of two was able to preside over a large state-owned farm in the northeastern village of Banzkow because childcare was widely available.",
      "Contrast that with Claudia Huth, a mother of five, who grew up in capitalist West Germany. Huth quit her job as a bank clerk when she was pregnant with her first child and led a life as a traditional housewife in the village of Egelsbach in Hesse, raising the kids and tending to her husband, who worked as a chemist.",
      "Both Leo and Huth fulfilled roles that in many ways were typical for women in the vastly different political systems that governed Germany during its decades of division following the country\u2019s defeat in World War II in 1945.",
      "As Germany celebrates the 35th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989 \u2014 and the country\u2019s reunification less than a year later on Oct. 3, 1990 \u2014 many in Germany are reflecting on how women\u2019s lives that have diverged so starkly under communism and capitalism have become much more similar again \u2014 though some differences remain even today.",
      "\u201cIn West Germany, women \u2014 not all, but many \u2014 had to fight for their right to have a career,\u201d said Clara Marz, the curator of an exhibition about women in divided Germany for the Federal Foundation for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Germany.",
      "Women in East Germany, meanwhile, often had jobs \u2014 though that was something that \u201cthey had been ordered from above to do,\u201d she added.",
      "Built in 1961, the Wall stood for 28 years at the front line of the Cold War between the Americans and the Soviets. It was built by the communist regime to cut off East Germans from the supposed ideological contamination of the West and to stem the tide of people fleeing East Germany.",
      "Today only a few stretches of the 156.4-kilometer (97.2-mile) barrier around the capitalist exclave of West Berlin remain, mostly as a tourist attraction.",
      "\u201cAll the heavy industry was in the west, there was nothing here,\u201d Leo, who is now 81 years old, said during a recent interview looking back at her life as a woman under communism. \u201cEast Germany had to pay war reparations to the Soviet Union. Women needed to work our own way out of that misery.\u201d",
      "By contrast, Leo said, women in the West didn't need to work because they were \u201cspoiled by the Marshall Plan\u201d \u2014 the United States\u2019 generous reconstruction plan that poured billions of dollars into West Germany and other European countries after the war.",
      "In capitalist West Germany, the economy recovered so quickly after the total devastation of WWII that people soon started talking of a Wirtschaftswunder, or \u201ceconomic miracle,\u201d that brought them affluence and stability less than 10 years after the war.",
      "That economic success, however, indirectly hampered women\u2019s quest for equal rights. Most West German women stayed at home and were expected to take care of their household while their husbands worked. Religion, too, played a much bigger role than in atheist East Germany, confining women to traditional roles as caregivers of the family.",
      "Mothers who tried to break out of these conventions and took on jobs were infamously decried as Rabenm\u00fctter, or uncaring moms who put work over family.",
      "Not all West German women perceived their traditional roles as restrictive.",
      "\u201cI always had this idea to be with my children, because I loved being with them,\" said Huth, now 69. \u201cIt never really occurred to me to go to work.\u201d",
      "More than three decades after Germany\u2019s unification, a new generation of women is barely aware of the different lives their mothers and grandmothers led depending on which part of the country they lived in. For most, combining work and motherhood has also become the normal way of life.",
      "Hannah Fiedler, an 18-year-old high school graduate from Berlin, said the fact that her family lived in East Germany during the decades of the country's division has no impact on her life today.",
      "\u201cEast or West \u2014 it's not even a topic in our family anymore,\u201d she said, as she sat on a bench near a thin, cobble-stoned path in the capital's Mitte neighborhood, which marks the former course of the Berlin Wall in the then-divided city.",
      "She also said that growing up, she had not experienced any disadvantages because she's female.",
      "\u201cI'm white and privileged \u2014 for good or worse \u2014 I don't expect any problems when I enter the working world in the future,\u201d she said.",
      "Some small differences between the formerly divided parts of Germany linger on. In the former East, 74% of women are working, compared to 71.5% in the West, according to a 2023 study by the Hans-B\u00f6ckler-Stiftung foundation.",
      "Childcare is also still more available in the former East than in the West.",
      "In 2018, 57% of children under the age of 3 were looked after in a childcare facility in the eastern state of Saxony. That compares with 27% in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia and 44% in Hamburg and Bremen, according to Germany's Federal Statistical Office.",
      "Germany as a whole trails behind some other European countries when it comes to gender equality.",
      "Only 31.4% lawmakers in Germany's national parliament are female, compared to 41% in Belgium's parliament, 43.6% in Denmark, 45% in Norway and 45.6% in Sweden.",
      "Nonetheless, Leo, the 81-year-old farmer from former East Germany, is optimistic that eventually women all over the country will have the same opportunities.",

      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",

      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",

      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "China has announced a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt in the latest push to rev up growth in the world's second largest economy",
      "BEIJING -- China on Friday approved a 6 trillion yuan ($839 billion) plan to help local governments refinance their mountains of debt, in the latest push to rev up growth in the world\u2019s second largest economy.",
      "The plan will be implemented over the next three years, Xu Hongcai, vice-chairman of the National People's Congress's financial and economic committee, said at a news conference Friday.",
      "Finance minister Lan Fo'an estimated that the hidden debt of local governments was 14.3 trillion yuan ($2 trillion) at the end of 2023. Hidden debt refers to debt that has not been disclosed publicly.",
      "Lan said 2 trillion yuan would be allocated each year from 2024 to 2026 to help local governments resolve their debts. He estimated that the amount of hidden debt will drop to 2.3 trillion yuan ($320.9 billion) by the end of 2028.",
      "Officials also said Friday that the ceiling to issue special bonds will be raised to 35.52 trillion yuan ($4.96 billion) from 29.52 trillion yuan ($4.12 billion) for local governments.",
      "Lan said that the implementation of such a large-scale replacement measure indicates a \u201cfundamental shift\u201d in China's approach to debt restructuring and said that China\u2019s government debt risk was \u201ccontrollable.\u201d",
      "Analysts have called for bold, multi-trillion-yuan measures to reinvigorate the world's second largest economy, which has yet to bounce back fully from the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Local government debts have ballooned partly due to high spending and low tax revenues during the pandemic, but also due to a downturn in the property industry, since sales of land use rights, a key source of local government revenue, have sagged.",
      "The central bank loosened restrictions on borrowing in late September, sparking a stock market rally, but economists say the government needs to do more to ignite a sustained recovery. Government officials have indicated that could come at this week's meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, which must give official approval to any new spending.",
      "The economy has shown signs of life in the past two months. Purchase subsidies offered to people who trade in old cars or appliances for new ones helped auto sales rebound in September. A survey of manufacturers turned positive in October after five straight months of decline, and exports surged 12.7% last month, the largest increase in more than two years.",
      "For most of the year, the ruling Communist Party appeared more focused on addressing long-term structural issues with the economy rather than short-term ones. Previous steps to boost the economy were piecemeal, seemingly aimed at keeping the economy afloat rather than sparking a robust recovery.",
      "In recent weeks, the party has signaled a growing concern about the economy's sluggishness as it tries to meet its goal of achieving growth of around 5% this year. The central bank's monetary easing was followed by government pronouncements that it still has ample funds to pump into the economy.",
      "Still, the longer-term goals of transforming China into a high-tech and green energy economy seem likely to remain the chief aims of the Communist Party, which doesn't face election pressures like the ones that toppled the Democrats and swept Donald Trump's Republicans to power in America this week.",

      "German Eonomy Minister Robert Habeck says he hopes to become his Green Party\u2019s candidate for chancellor in the coming election",
      "BERLIN -- Germany's economy minister said Friday that he hopes to become his Green Party's candidate for chancellor in the upcoming election.",
      "The announcement by Robert Habeck, who is also vice chancellor, follows the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition on Wednesday.",
      "The Greens are a small party that lost popularity in recent elections and whose support currently hovers around 10%. Germany\u2019s opposition center-right is leading in the polls.",
      "It is therefore unlikely that Habeck could end up as the country's leader. His move, however, indicates how German politicians are gearing up for an early election after the collapse of the coalition.",
      "\u201cI am applying as a candidate for the Greens, for the people of Germany,\u201d Habeck said in a video posted on X. \u201cIf you want, also as chancellor. But that is not my decision, that is your decision. Only you can decide that.\u201d",
      "Scholz indicated plans for a timeline that could bring an early election by late March \u2014 before the vote that is regularly scheduled for September 2025.",
      "However, the opposition is calling for an immediate confidence vote in the parliament to speed that up. Industry leaders are also among those saying that Germany needs a stable government in place soon, as the economy struggles and as Europe prepares for a change of leadership in the United States.",
      "Scholz on Friday said that he's willing to talk about the timing of a vote of confidence and the subsequent new election. He said consultations were taking place with stakeholders, including groups in the German Bundestag and constitutional bodies, in order \u201cto take into account what the others think and mean.\u201d",
      "\u201cI believe that we will soon achieve good results, at least that would be my hope,\" he said on the sidelines of a meeting in Budapest.",
      "Habeck hopes to be nominated at a party conference in Wiesbaden next week. He doesn't appear to have serious contenders after Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock announced this summer that she didn't want to pursue a candidacy for chancellor.",
      "Germany has been governed since 2021 by a coalition led by Scholz's Social Democrats and which included the smaller pro-business Free Democrats and the environmental Greens.",
      "It has been an uneasy and fractious alliance, and it collapsed Wednesday when Scholz fired Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the Free Democrats in a late-night move following disagreements over how to revive the shrinking economy.",

    "summary": "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
    "story": [
      "Maine is testing the legal limits of restrictions on so-called super PACs",
      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Maine residents this week overwhelmingly approved a referendum to limit donations to political action committees that spend independently in candidate elections, setting the stage for a legal showdown over caps on individual contributions to so-called super PACs that spend freely in elections.",
      "In the nation's only campaign finance reform initiative on the ballot on Election Day, residents voted to cap individual donations to super PACs at $5,000. Supporters fully expect a lawsuit that they hope will bring clarity to PAC donations after the U.S. Supreme Court opened the door to unlimited spending by super PACs.",
      "The measure was carefully crafted to survive legal challenges as states try to find a way to regulate campaign spending after the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United decision, said state Sen. Rick Bennett, a supporter of the proposal.",
      "\"We\u2019ve become a place where our democracy is being bought and sold by the richest people in our country,\" said Bennett, a Republican from Oxford. \u201cPeople of all political stripes support this measure. The only people who really oppose this are the monied interests who abuse the system.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court opened the floodgates for big business and labor unions to spend freely on elections in the Citizens United decision, and a Court of Appeals decision three months later lifted limits on individual spending.",
      "The Maine initiative doesn't attempt to limit independent spending on behalf of candidates. It focuses instead on limits on individual donations to super PACS, an area the Supreme Court has not ruled on, observers say.",
      "Cara McCormick, leader of Citizens to End Super PACs in Maine, said the goal is to reduce the outsized influence that super PACs currently enjoy through so-called \u201cdark money\u201d spending.",
      "Political nonprofit groups are not required to disclose their donors and do not have to reveal much about how they spend the donations they receive. A super PAC may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to campaign independently for candidates for federal office. Its activities must be reported to the Federal Elections Commission but is not otherwise regulated if not coordinated with the candidate or campaign.",
      "\u201cWe have the right to stand up to the big money in politics in Maine. We\u2019re asserting our right to limit the amount of money that someone can give to a super PAC to eliminate not only corruption in our politics but the appearance of corruption in our politics. We think that\u2019s something worth fighting for,\u201d McCormick said.",
      "In Maine, the limit would only apply to PACs spending money on behalf of candidates, not ballot committees involved in referendums. Maine law currently limits contributions to candidates, not PACs. For general elections, individuals can contribute a maximum of $1,950 to a gubernatorial candidate and $475 to a legislative candidate.",
      "Harvard Law School professor Lawrence Lessig, a longtime advocate for campaign finance reform, and his Equal Citizens nonprofit backed the Maine referendum. A similar citizen initiative effort in Massachusetts was blocked by the attorney general on constitutional concerns.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of individual contributions to PACs, and long-established case law supports the notion that states can limit individual contributions to PACs despite a decision to the contrary by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, Lessig said.",
      "The concern with unlimited individual contributions is the risk of a quid pro quo even when super PACs are spending independently and not coordinating directly with a candidate, Lessig said.",
      "The matter will ultimately have to be decided by the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very optimistic that the U.S. Supreme Court will apply existing jurisprudence that states are free to limit contributions,\u201d he said. \u201cThe issue that this case would raise is not asking the Supreme Court to change its jurisprudence, not asking them to overturn Citizens United.\u201d",
      "The Maine law goes into effect this winter, if there is no legal challenge, after an emphatic vote. Nearly 75% of voters supported the citizen initiative."

      "ATHENS, Greece -- Recent efforts to smooth the frequently volatile ties between neighbors and regional rivals Greece and Turkey are bearing fruit, their foreign ministers said Friday, although significant differences remain between the two countries as they seek ways to prevent spats from escalating dangerously.",
      "Despite both being members of NATO, Greece and Turkey have been at loggerheads for decades over a long series of issues, including complex maritime boundary disputes that led them to the brink of war in 1987 and in 1996. In 2020, tension over drilling rights led to Greek and Turkish warships shadowing each other in the eastern Mediterranean.",
      "Over the past 16 months, the two sides have made concerted efforts to reduce tensions, with the Greek and Turkish leaders meeting six times. Last December, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation deals during a meeting in Athens between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.",
      "\u201cI am not claiming that through the dialogue we have developed, all the problems in the two countries' relations have been magically resolved,\u201d Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said in statements to the media after a meeting with his Turkish counterpart, Hakan Fidan, in Athens. The ministers didn't take any questions.",
      "\u201cThere were indeed difficult moments during the past year,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cBut in all cases, there was an immediate and honest channel that prevented escalation.\u201d",
      "With two brutal conflicts raging in the wider region, in Ukraine and in the Middle East, mending ties and preventing flare-ups in tension between the two neighbors has become all the more essential.",
      "\"We are working to understand each other better on critical issues. The region we are in has many problems,\" Fidan said. \"Turkey and Greece need to be able to act with mutual trust in this difficult geography. Through a win-win approach, we can contribute to the prosperity and peace of our people.\u201d",
      "Despite the positive climate, the two sides remain far apart on some of the thornier issues, notably on territorial rights in the Aegean Sea. The two disagree on the delineation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone, which determines exploitation rights for resources, as well as on the extent of territorial waters.",
      "Turkey has said that any move by Greece to extend its territorial waters around its islands in the Aegean Sea from six nautical miles to 12 nautical miles, which Greece insists it has the right to do at any time, would be a cause for war.",
      "Turkey also doesn\u2019t recognize that Greek islands off its borders have a continental shelf, while Greece insists that position is in contravention of international law.",
      "Athens insists the issue of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone is the only dispute it has with Turkey and is willing to bring it to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.",
      "Friday\u2019s talks \u201cincluded the evaluation of the conditions for the start of a fundamental discussion for the delineation of the continental shelf and the Exclusive Economic Zone in the Aegean and the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d Gerapetritis said. \u201cIt is an initial, honest approach of a difficult but also crucial issue.\u201d",
      "Fidan stressed that all areas of disagreement connected to the Aegean, the sea that lies between the two countries, must be tackled.",
      "\u201cThere are many problems that are interconnected in the Aegean. These disputes cannot be reduced to the issues of the continent shelf and exclusive economic zones,\" Fidan said. \"We must address all issues that have the potential to create tensions and crises on the basis of mutual respect and cooperation.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Turkey, we continue to defend the principle of equitable sharing in the eastern Mediterranean,\u201d he added.",
      "Migration has been a source of tension between the two countries for years. Tens of thousands of people make their way each year from Turkey to nearby Greek islands, using European Union-member Greece as a gateway to more prosperous countries in the 27-nation bloc.",
      "While thousands of migrants continue to arrive in Greece, risking sometimes fatal sea crossings, the two ministers stressed the need to crack down on illegal migration and smuggling networks.",
      "The two \u201cemphasized the importance of acting together to combat irregular migration,\u201d Fidan said.",

      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",

      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said."

      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

    "story": [
      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has filed a lawsuit challenging a measure Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- Cherokee Nation Entertainment on Friday filed a lawsuit challenging a constitutional amendment Arkansas voters approved this week that revokes its license for a planned casino in the state.",
      "The lawsuit filed in federal court claims the measure approved by voters on Tuesday violates its constitutional rights, and seeks to block its enforcement before it takes effect Nov. 13. The constitutional amendment blocks a casino that was planned in Pope County.",
      "Pope County was one of four sites where casinos were allowed to be built under a constitutional amendment that voters approved in 2018. Casinos have already been set up in the other three locations.",
      "\u201cCherokee Nation Entertainment is firmly committed to protecting its constitutional rights, defending its lawfully issued casino license, and safeguarding the substantial investments it made in good faith based on the establishment of the Pope County casino license under Amendment 100 in 2018,\" Bart Calhoun, an attorney for Cherokee Nation Entertainment, said in a statement.",
      "The lawsuit is the latest in a costly fight between the Cherokee Nation and the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma, which had spent at least $30 million combined on the campaign over the ballot measure. The state Supreme Court last month rejected a lawsuit by the Cherokee Nation that sought to disqualify the measure from the ballot. The Choctaw Nation operates a casino near the Arkansas border.",
      "\u201cThis legal action to attempt to bypass the voice of Arkansas voters is not unexpected,\u201d said Hans Stiritz, spokesman for Local Voters in Charge, the campaign backed by the Choctaw Nation in favor of the measure. \u201cBut we are fully confident in the process that brought Issue 2 to the ballot. Arkansas voters have spoken clearly on Issue 2 and we expect it to stand.\u201d",

      "The proposed amendment removes the Pope County casino\u2019s authorization from the state constitution. It also requires future casino licenses to be approved by voters in the county where it would be located. The constitution currently requires casino license applicants to submit letters of support from local officials.",
      "Cherokee Nation Entertainment has said it plans to build a 50,000-square-foot (4,600-square-meter) casino northeast of Russellville, 60 miles (97 kilometers) northwest of Little Rock. Plans also call for a 200-room hotel, a conference center and an outdoor music venue."

      "Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president",
      "WASHINGTON -- Global efforts to fight climate change stumbled but survived the last time Donald Trump was elected president and withdrew the United States from an international climate agreement. Other countries, states, cities and businesses picked up some of the slack.",
      "But numerous experts worry that a second Trump term will be more damaging, with the United States withdrawing even further from climate efforts in a way that could cripple future presidents' efforts. With Trump, who has dismissed climate change, in charge of the world's leading economy, those experts fear other countries \u2014 especially top polluting nation China \u2014 could use it as an excuse to ease off their own efforts to curb carbon emissions.",
      "\u201cThere's no hope of reaching a safe climate without substantive action from the United States, from China, from Europe,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson, who chairs the Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists that tracks countries' carbon dioxide emissions, which have been rising globally. He said he's certain the world is shooting past the internationally accepted threshold of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times. That's just a couple tenths of a degree away. Others believe the goal is alive.",
      "Trump's reelection comes as the world is on track to set yet another record hot year, and has been lurching from drought to hurricane to flood to wildfire.",
      "\u201cAn emboldened Trump would be terrible,\u201d European Climate Foundation CEO Laurence Tubiana said in August.",
      "On Wednesday, Tubiana, the former French official who helped forge the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement that Trump pulled out of, called the election result a setback for global climate action. But she added: \"The Paris Agreement has proven resilient and is stronger than any single country\u2019s policy.\u201d",
      "The United Nations\u2019 annual climate negotiations to follow on the Paris accord start next week in Baku, Azerbaijan. In the months after, all countries including the U.S. must issue national plans showing how they will increase efforts to limit heat-trapping emissions from coal, oil and natural gas.",
      "\u201cBaku will be the earliest test of the resilience of the global climate regime,\u201d said Asia Society Policy Institute Director Li Shuo, who foresees the European Union and China stepping up to fill the U.S. leadership void, especially economically. \u201cIt should also unite other countries.\u201d",
      "It sort of did that in 2017, when Trump announced that the U.S. would abandon the Paris climate agreement.",
      "\"Not a single country followed the U.S. out the door,\" said Alden Meyer, a longtime climate negotiations analyst with the European think tank E3G. \"We saw the birth and launch of the We Are Still In movement of subnational actors, investors, businesses, governors, mayors and others here in the U.S.\u201d",
      "Meyer and others said a more serious step than withdrawing from Paris is possible. That would be pulling out of an underlying treaty from 1992 that set curbing climate change and saving biodiversity as part of global environmental goals for the 21st century, as well as withdrawing from the United Nations climate change fighting system that fosters negotiations, records emissions and what's being done about them.",
      "Project 2025, a conservative post-election blueprint that the Trump campaign distanced itself from but was written by his allies, called for withdrawing from both that U.N. framework and the Paris Agreement.",
      "In 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush signed the Rio conventions, which set up the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That eventually led to agreements in Kyoto and Paris. The Rio agreement was unanimously approved by the U.S. Senate, but senators soundly rejected the 1997 Kyoto Protocol and President George W. Bush pulled the U.S. out of it.",
      "When negotiators were crafting the 2015 Paris deal, they made it voluntary and made it part of the Rio treaty so no Senate approval was needed. That allowed President Joe Biden in 2021 to immediately rejoin the Paris Agreement without Senate approval.",
      "It's not straightforward, but an exit from Rio and the UNFCCC could make it nearly impossible for the U.S. to get back into climate negotiations, Meyer said.",
      "David Waskow, international climate director for World Resources Institute, agreed. He said withdrawal from the U.N. agreement \u201cwould not only place the U.S. on the sidelines of international climate discussions but would be like ejecting itself from the stadium.\u201d",
      "The Paris agreement calls for nations to submit new and more aggressive plans to reduce emissions of heat-trapping gases every five years. Those are due next February and the Biden administration has promised to submit one before it ends \u201cto show what should be done, what can be done,\u201d Meyer said. But the assumption is that the new Trump administration won't honor it, he said.",
      "Meyer said the United States pulling out of climate agreements in Republican administrations and then trying to lead the world in Democratic ones is like the Peanuts cartoon when Lucy keeps pulling the football away from Charlie Brown.",
      "\u201cThe world has gotten tired of this routine,\u201d Meyer said.",
      "Joanna Depledge, a historian of international climate negotiations, said she expected Trump's new term will mean four lost years for U.S. climate action. But she added: \u201cThe rest of the world is used to U.S. flip-flopping now and will not be diverted from their own efforts.\u201d",
      "Because of the 2020 pandemic and the timing of deadlines created by the Paris Agreement, the three United Nations climate negotiations that took place during the first Trump administration weren\u2019t as ambitious as they could have been. Now, urgent action is needed at the summit this year and next, Depledge and others said.",
      "U.N. climate chief Simon Stiell said negotiations continue because \u201cthe fundamental facts remain unchanged: global heating is already hammering every nation, hitting national and households budgets harder every year.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration will still represent the United States next week, when crucial negotiations will address financial help that poor nations need to cope with and fight climate change. But Harris' loss undercuts negotiations because \u201ceveryone there knows\" the U.S. is unlikely to follow through on any agreement it signs, Stanford's Jackson said.",
      "One of the dynamics of past negotiations during Democratic regimes was that any U.S.-China deal usually led to a global one. Usually the United States \u201cis able to nudge\u201d a more reluctant China to be more ambitious about fighting climate change, Asia Society's Li Shuo said.",
      "\u201cBeijing will read the air in Washington and their conclusion is climate does not enjoy the same level of momentum it had a couple of years ago,\u201d Li said.",
      "But despite all this, many in the insular world of climate negotiations somehow keep optimistic.",
      "\u201cThere is an antidote to doom and despair,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres said. \u201cIt's action on the ground and it's happening in all corners of the Earth.\u201d",

      "Tens of thousands of activists of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have rallied in the nation's capital",
      "DHAKA, Bangladesh -- Tens of thousands of activists of a leading political party in Bangladesh rallied in the nation\u2019s capital on Friday, calling for a new election and quick reforms.",
      "The country is under an interim government after the fall of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled in August.",
      "The Bangladesh Nationalist Party, or BNP, led by former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia organized the rally as it has been pushing the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, to bring about quick reforms and to hold the next national election.",
      "Hasina and Zia are the main political rivals in a dynastic political framework. Zia is ailing and was unable to lead the rally in person, and her elder son, Tarique Rahman, is the heir apparent and has been living in exile since 2008.",
      "On Friday, BNP activists took to the streets of Dhaka and marched through major thoroughfares before reaching the country\u2019s national parliament building to symbolize that they were eager for their party to form the next government.",
      "The Yunus-led government hasn't declared any timeframe for the next election. The BNP had initially demanded election in three months after Yunus took over three days after Hasina fled the country to India on Aug. 5 amid a student-led mass uprising, ending her 15-year rule.",
      "The BNP leaders had earlier said the Yuns-led government should move forward to hold the election, rather than staying in power for long, but the party wants to give the government a reasonable amount of time to bring some reforms.",
      "On Friday, Rahman said by videoconference from London that the interim government mustn't be allowed to fail under any situation as the government has been facing serious challenges to bring order in the country. Hasina's Awami League party and its allies are also facing challenges to navigate through the new political scenario.",
      "Avoiding any direct reference about next election, Rahman said that the government must take effective steps to meet the expectations of the people. BNP leaders have recently indicated that the party would go ahead with plans for street protests in two to three months if the interim government doesn't roll out a road map for the next election.",
      "Rahman told his cheering supporters to remain vigilant as he said that the accomplices of the former government of Hasina were still active.",
      "\u201cThe accomplices of the exiled autocrats are still present at home and abroad, in governance and administration, actively working to unsettle the interim government. This interim government must not be allowed to fail under any circumstances,\u201d said Rahman, also his party\u2019s acting chairman.",
      "\u201c(But) the interim government must take effective steps to meet the expectations of the people. This is what the public desires today,\u201d he said.",
      "Friday's political show came as Hasina is facing charges of crimes against humanity for hundreds of deaths involving the July-August uprising in the country. The government said that it would seek her repatriation from India once a court decision comes."

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has not said what he would do on student loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over what will happen with their payments once President Joe Biden leaves office",
      "Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness efforts.",
      "Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden's time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250.",
      "\"With this new administration, the dream is gone. It\u2019s shot,\u201d said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. \u201cI was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it\u2019s at a standstill.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden's loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances.",
      "The economy was an important issue in the election, helping to propel Trump to victory. But for borrowers, concerns about their finances extend beyond inflation to include their student debt, said Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of what is making life unaffordable for them is this burden of expenses that they can\u2019t seem to get out from under,\u201d Yu said.",
      "Student loan cancellation was not a focus of the campaign for either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, who steered clear of the issue at her political events. The issue came up just once in the September presidential debate, when Trump hammered Harris and Biden for failing to deliver their promise of widespread forgiveness. Trump called it a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d that \u201ctaunted young people.\u201d",
      "Biden promised the student loan cancellation program during his run for the presidency. From its launch, Biden's loan forgiveness faced relentless pushback from opponents who said it heaped advantage on elites and came at the expense of those who repaid their loans or did not attend college.",
      "Biden\u2019s first plan to cancel up to $20,000 for millions of people was blocked by the Supreme Court last year. A second, narrower plan has been halted by a federal judge after Republican-led states sued. A separate policy intended to lower loan payments for struggling borrowers has been paused by a judge, also after Republican-controlled states challenged it.",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the loan cancellations.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\u201d said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Overall, Biden's efforts were relatively unpopular, even among those with student loans. Three in 10 U.S. adults said they approved of how Biden had handled student loan debt, according to a poll this spring from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Four in 10 disapproved. The others were neutral or didn\u2019t know enough to say.",
      "Project 2025, the blueprint for a hard-right turn in American government that aligns with some Trump priorities, calls for getting the federal government out of the student loan business and doing away with repayment plans that pre-date the Biden administration.",
      "Even without directly addressing student loans, Trump has made promises that would affect them. He has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. It's unclear which entity would take that responsibility if the department were eliminated, which would require approval from Congress.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition.",
      "Yu noted the Biden administration managed to cancel student loans for about 5 million borrowers, even though the signature forgiveness effort has been blocked. The administration did it by leaning into loan cancellation programs already in effect. For example, an existing student loan forgiveness program for public service workers has granted relief to more than 1 million Americans, up from just 7,000 who were approved before it was updated by the Biden administration two years ago.",
      "\u201cA lot of the cancellation that we saw in the last couple of years was because the Biden administration was committed to making the programs that are actually enshrined in law work for people,\" Yu said.",
      "Sabrina Calazans, 27, owes about $30,000 on federal student loans from her college days at Arcadia University in Pennsylvania. Her payments also have been on hold, but she could soon face a monthly payment of over $300.",
      "\u201cAs a first-generation American, I live at home with my family, I contribute to our household finances, and that payment is a lot for me and so many others like me,\u201d said Calazans, who is originally from Brazil.",
      "In her role as managing director for Student Debt Crisis Center, Calazans said she has been telling people to stay up to date on developments by using the loan simulator on the Federal Student Aid website and reading updated information on forgiveness qualifications and repayment programs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion about student loans,\" Calazans said, and not just among young people. \"We\u2019re seeing a lot of parents take out more debt for their children to be able to go to school. We\u2019re seeing older folks go back to school and having to take out loans as well.\u201d",

      "The company, known for its trendy footwear for teens, announced the moves during its earnings call Thursday, and said it had already been developing a factory network in Cambodia, Vietnam, Mexico and Brazil for several years. Analysts have predicted that other companies will be feeling more pressure to move more goods out of China and will be following suit.",
      "During his first term, Trump imposed tariffs that targeted imported solar panels, steel, aluminum and pretty much everything from China. But this time, he has gone much further and has proposed a 60% tariff on goods from China \u2014 and a tariff of up to 20% on everything else the United States imports.",

      "The agreement with Telef\u00f3nica S.A. announced Friday is the second time that the telco giant has faced bribery accusations in the U.S. after it was ordered in 2019 to pay a $4.1 million penalty to the Securities and Exchange Commission for providing tickets to the FIFA World Cup for foreign officials it was seeking to influence.",
      "The latest bribery scheme started around 2014, when a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica bribed two Venezuelan officials to participate in an auction that allowed it to get U.S. dollars in exchange for Venezuelan bolivars, Justice Department officials said.",

The amount represented about 65% of the $172 million awarded to telecommunications companies that year, prosecutors said in court filings in Manhattan.",

      "Money from name, image and likeness deals has changed what it means to be an NCAA athlete for some college players",
      "PHOENIX -- Sponsorship deals were far from Jonny Bottorff's mind when he transferred to Northern Arizona University on a football scholarship. As money-making opportunities for college athletes have boomed since then, the offensive lineman has earned a few hundred dollars through name, image and likeness deals, but nothing that has changed his life.",
      "Bottorff, 23, earned an undergraduate degree and is now working on his master\u2019s degree at the Division I school in Flagstaff, Arizona. He transferred from Missouri Western State University, a small Division II school in Saint Joseph, Missouri.",
      "\u201cI think the reality for most college athletes is things haven\u2019t really changed that much. We just got an extra little bit of cash in our pockets that probably needed to happen,\u201d Bottorff said.",
      "For some players, money from NIL deals has transformed what it means to be a college athlete. But outside the highest-profile athletes, who now can earn millions of dollars while still in school, many players say a college degree remains the ultimate prize.",
      "College athletes graduate at rates that are comparable to and often higher than non-athletes. For Division I schools, the NCAA last year reported data showing a record 91% of athletes are graduating.",
      "Before the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that U.S.-born athletes could earn money from advertisements, autographs and university boosters, college athletes were under a simple agreement with their institutions: compete in exchange for a degree.",
      "Money received through NIL agreements has changed the equation for athletes like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, who leveraged their personal brands while still in college, securing endorsement deals with the likes of Reebok, Powerade and Beats by Dre.",
      "Where academics rates as a priority varies with each individual. But several Division I athletes said in interviews the money available to them through NIL remains a small consideration compared with earning a degree and competing in the sports they love.",
      "Anthony Leal, a guard for Indiana University's basketball team, said he is coming back as a fifth-year senior because of school, even though he received his undergraduate degree last year. He said earning a master's in business administration was always the goal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about 70% through the program in the Kelley School of Business,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get that degree.\u201d",
      "NCAA eligibility rules allow athletes five years to compete athletically across four seasons. Under the redshirt eligibility rule, many receive an athletic scholarship and practice their first year, but do not compete in games or matches. The NCAA also allowed athletes to extend their eligibility by a year if their team was affected by the pandemic.",
      "For some athletes, NIL money is an incentive to attend and stay in college, but Leal said it's not often that athletes are completely disinterested in school.",
      "\u201cEvery student knows that it has to be a piece of the puzzle at some level. So everyone kind of understands the value of school,\u201d Leal said. \u201cBut, yeah, sure, some people may have other goals. There are plenty of people, maybe not at Indiana, but there are plenty of people throughout college basketball who don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve got NIL (money) and the transfer portal.\u201d",
      "The transfer portal has become a plug-and-play method for powerhouses and rebuilding programs alike. It has made it easy for athletes to switch colleges and play the next season, rather than sitting out a year under previous rules. And it has become a way for top athletes to shop around for more lucrative opportunities. UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka, for one, walked away from the team in a dispute over a $100,000 NIL payment his agent says was promised but never paid.",
      "The NIL market is expected to reach $1.67 billion in the 2024-2025 school year, according to an estimate by the NIL platform Opendorse. The highest earnings go to top men's basketball and football players.",
      "Even though the NCAA now allows players to transfer without sitting out, the academic transition can be more complicated.",
      "Ray Harrison started at Presbyterian College in 2020, but transferred in 2022 to Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university in Phoenix where he is a senior guard on the basketball team. He said NIL money wasn't a factor. It was about finding a better fit for him.",
      "\u201cI just came out here because this is where God led my heart. Of course, we win two (conference) championships and that changes things,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t a smooth transition \u2014 a lot of his course credits didn\u2019t transfer. \u201cWhen I got here, I had to do some catching up.\u201d",
      "Trinity San Antonio, another student who transferred to Grand Canyon, previously attended California Baptist, a private university in Riverside, California. Finding a school that would accept the majority of her previously earned college credits was harder than she expected.",
      "\u201cComing in as a freshman when you\u2019re really a junior is not ideal,\u201d said San Antonio, who also played basketball for Puerto Rico last summer in the Paris Olympics.",
      "A shot at a college education remains a dream for many younger athletes.",
      "Tavarius Covington, a wide receiver on his high school football team in Chicago, has ambitions of playing in college. But he said his priority is school. He hopes to pursue a business degree.",
      "Covington took a break from football but came back to it last year, hoping it would help him become the first in his family to go to college and earn a degree, he said.",
      "\u201cI was watching my little brother play. We were going to his games and the family was excited for him. It made me interested in the game again,\u201d he said. \u201cPart of it is trying to establish a foundation for him, too, as a first-generation college student, hopefully. I want him to know there is more to look forward to coming out of high school.\u201d",

      "Dalmau\u2019s strong showing was a sign of a growing body of voters who are giving up on the island\u2019s two established parties.",

      "Jones confirmed on his radio show that Prescott's hamstring was partially torn off the bone, an injury known as a partial avulsion.",
      "A full tear of the tendon off the bone requires surgery, and that\u2019s what happened two years ago in training camp when former Dallas left tackle Tyron Smith missed 13 games. In Prescott\u2019s case, Jones said it could be a few weeks before it is known whether surgery will be required.",
      "The injury happened in last week's 27-21 loss to Atlanta. Cooper Rush will start in Prescott's place Sunday against NFC East rival Philadelphia (6-2) with the defending division champion Cowboys (3-5) trying to to stay in the playoff race after qualifying with 12-5 records each of the past three seasons.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s got to have some weeks off of it before he can see if it really does require surgery,\u201d Jones said on his radio show. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want surgery. He wants to be on the field and go for it. He\u2019s weighing that. We\u2019re weighing that.\u201d",
      "Stephen Jones, Jerry's son and the Cowboys' executive vice president of personnel, said on his radio show later Friday that Prescott would be placed on injured reserve. The move will sideline the 31-year-old at least four games, and Prescott is likely to be out longer than that.",
      "\u201cObviously a tough, tough situation, losing him for that period of time,\u201d Stephen Jones said. \u201cBut we're going to do what's in the best interest of Dak and right now I don't think anyone knows whether it'll be four weeks, six weeks or the season.\u201d",

      "A new element to replacing Prescott is the presence of Trey Lance, the No. 3 overall pick in the 2021 draft by San Francisco. The 49ers traded him to the Cowboys last year after Lance lost the battle for the backup job, and he has been the third QB for Dallas since then.",
      "Lance took the vast majority of the snaps in the preseason so coach Mike McCarthy and his staff could evaluate a 24-year-old who is on an expiring rookie contract.",
      "McCarthy has indicated he would stick with Rush the same way he has with Prescott, therefore shying away from packages that might incorporate Lance, who is by far the most mobile of the three QBs.",
      "Jerry Jones suggested otherwise on his radio show for an offense that has struggled even with a healthy Prescott and has the second-worst rushing attack in the NFL.",
      "\u201cOh, there is a window for Trey Lance,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere's packages that we can work on. Let me be clear, that's not just to get Lance some play time. That's to bring to the table some offense for us.\u201d",

      "Money from name, image and likeness deals has changed what it means to be an NCAA athlete for some college players",
      "PHOENIX -- Sponsorship deals were far from Jonny Bottorff's mind when he transferred to Northern Arizona University on a football scholarship. As money-making opportunities for college athletes have boomed since then, the offensive lineman has earned a few hundred dollars through name, image and likeness deals, but nothing that has changed his life.",
      "Bottorff, 23, earned an undergraduate degree and is now working on his master\u2019s degree at the Division I school in Flagstaff, Arizona. He transferred from Missouri Western State University, a small Division II school in Saint Joseph, Missouri.",
      "\u201cI think the reality for most college athletes is things haven\u2019t really changed that much. We just got an extra little bit of cash in our pockets that probably needed to happen,\u201d Bottorff said.",
      "For some players, money from NIL deals has transformed what it means to be a college athlete. But outside the highest-profile athletes, who now can earn millions of dollars while still in school, many players say a college degree remains the ultimate prize.",
      "College athletes graduate at rates that are comparable to and often higher than non-athletes. For Division I schools, the NCAA last year reported data showing a record 91% of athletes are graduating.",
      "Before the Supreme Court ruled in 2021 that U.S.-born athletes could earn money from advertisements, autographs and university boosters, college athletes were under a simple agreement with their institutions: compete in exchange for a degree.",
      "Money received through NIL agreements has changed the equation for athletes like Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels and Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese, who leveraged their personal brands while still in college, securing endorsement deals with the likes of Reebok, Powerade and Beats by Dre.",
      "Where academics rates as a priority varies with each individual. But several Division I athletes said in interviews the money available to them through NIL remains a small consideration compared with earning a degree and competing in the sports they love.",
      "Anthony Leal, a guard for Indiana University's basketball team, said he is coming back as a fifth-year senior because of school, even though he received his undergraduate degree last year. He said earning a master's in business administration was always the goal.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m about 70% through the program in the Kelley School of Business,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to get that degree.\u201d",
      "NCAA eligibility rules allow athletes five years to compete athletically across four seasons. Under the redshirt eligibility rule, many receive an athletic scholarship and practice their first year, but do not compete in games or matches. The NCAA also allowed athletes to extend their eligibility by a year if their team was affected by the pandemic.",
      "For some athletes, NIL money is an incentive to attend and stay in college, but Leal said it's not often that athletes are completely disinterested in school.",
      "\u201cEvery student knows that it has to be a piece of the puzzle at some level. So everyone kind of understands the value of school,\u201d Leal said. \u201cBut, yeah, sure, some people may have other goals. There are plenty of people, maybe not at Indiana, but there are plenty of people throughout college basketball who don\u2019t care because you\u2019ve got NIL (money) and the transfer portal.\u201d",
      "The transfer portal has become a plug-and-play method for powerhouses and rebuilding programs alike. It has made it easy for athletes to switch colleges and play the next season, rather than sitting out a year under previous rules. And it has become a way for top athletes to shop around for more lucrative opportunities. UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka, for one, walked away from the team in a dispute over a $100,000 NIL payment his agent says was promised but never paid.",
      "The NIL market is expected to reach $1.67 billion in the 2024-2025 school year, according to an estimate by the NIL platform Opendorse. The highest earnings go to top men's basketball and football players.",
      "Even though the NCAA now allows players to transfer without sitting out, the academic transition can be more complicated.",
      "Ray Harrison started at Presbyterian College in 2020, but transferred in 2022 to Grand Canyon University, a private Christian university in Phoenix where he is a senior guard on the basketball team. He said NIL money wasn't a factor. It was about finding a better fit for him.",
      "\u201cI just came out here because this is where God led my heart. Of course, we win two (conference) championships and that changes things,\u201d he said. But it wasn\u2019t a smooth transition \u2014 a lot of his course credits didn\u2019t transfer. \u201cWhen I got here, I had to do some catching up.\u201d",
      "Trinity San Antonio, another student who transferred to Grand Canyon, previously attended California Baptist, a private university in Riverside, California. Finding a school that would accept the majority of her previously earned college credits was harder than she expected.",
      "\u201cComing in as a freshman when you\u2019re really a junior is not ideal,\u201d said San Antonio, who also played basketball for Puerto Rico last summer in the Paris Olympics.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge has denied a motion by two NASCAR teams \u2014 one owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan \u2014 to be recognized as chartered teams as they proceed in an antitrust lawsuit against the stock car series and chairman Jim France",
      "AVONDALE, Ariz. -- A federal judge on Friday denied a motion by two NASCAR teams \u2014 one of them owned by Basketball Hall of Famer Michael Jordan \u2014 to be recognized as chartered teams as they proceed with their antitrust lawsuit against the stock car series and chairman Jim France.",
      "The motion was signed by federal Judge Frank Whitney of the U.S. District Court of Western North Carolina in Charlotte at the exact same time NASCAR executives were giving their annual \u201cState of the Sport\u201d address at Phoenix Raceway.",
      "NASCAR President Steve Phelps opened the address by noting that series officials have not publicly discussed negotiations over charters in the more than two-year process and would not start now.",
      "\u201cI know people are frustrated about that,\u201d Phelps said. \"We are not going to negotiate in the media about charters, ever. And we are very happy that 32 of the 36 charters were extended because those were race teams that where the deal that was put on the table for them, the primary big win for the race teams was money.",
      "\u201cI won't go into what the money split looks like, but what I will say is that the amount of money, it now puts the race teams, starting in '25, as the single largest beneficiary of our media deal,\" he added. \"And we did that because the race teams were upside down financially.\u201d",
      "The court decision came down just hours before Cup Series cars hit the track for the first practice session of championship weekend. Tyler Reddick, who drives for Jordan-owned 23XI Racing, is one of four driver in Sunday's winner-take-all finale.",
      "When the ruling came out and NASCAR was informed as executives sat on the stage at Phoenix Raceway, NASCAR chief operating officer Steve O\u2019Donnell quipped: \u201cYou can't make it up, for the timing\u201d as he and Phelps declined comment.",
      "Jeffrey Kessler, an antitrust attorney hired by the 23XI and Front Row Motorsports in the legal fight, indicated after Monday\u2019s hearing in Charlotte that the plaintiffs can immediately appeal the ruling.",
      "\u201cWe are pleased with the court's decision to expedite discovery and fast track the schedule in our case against NASCAR,\u201d Kessler said Friday. \"Although we are disappointed that the preliminary injunction was denied without prejudice and as premature, which we intend to appeal, this denial has no bearing on the merits of our case. My clients will move forward to race in 2025 and fight for a more fair and equitable system in NASCAR that complies with antitrust laws.\u201d",
      "Both 23XI and Front Row Motorsports refused to sign a take-it-or-leave-it charter agreement presented to teams by NASCAR in September, just 48 hours before the playoffs began. The offers came after more than two years of negotiations and 13 of 15 teams signed the deal.",
      "23XI Racing and Front Row accused NASCAR of being \u201cmonopolistic bullies\u201d in forcing teams to into what is essentially a revenue-sharing agreement between the sanctioning body and its teams.",
      "NASCAR has since rescinded the offers on charter extensions to 23XI and Front Row, whose current charters expire at the end of the year. The teams are free to operate as \u201copen\u201d teams but the lack of chartered protection denies them an equal share of revenue, a guaranteed spot in the field of 38 races and other provisions.",
      "23XI and Front Row have asked for things to remain status quo as their antitrust case proceeds because the new charters prevent teams from suing NASCAR. Kessler asked that the teams be released from that clause for the duration of the lawsuit.",
      "In his ruling, the judge found that Kessler failed to demonstrate that 23XI and Front Row \u201cwill face irreparable harm through several avenues.\u201d",
      "Kessler had argued the plaintiffs asserted they risk losing sponsors while competing as open teams because the sponsors \u201ccould abandon (them) if they ... do not qualify for all of their races.\u201d For instance, Kessler said 23XI\u2019s sponsorship agreements require that each sponsored car runs in every Cup Series race, so failure to qualify for a race could reduce the amount of sponsorship money it receives.",
      "The plaintiffs also alleged they will risk the loss of their drivers if their cars are not chartered. Kessler said Reddick is permitted to terminate his contract with the team if there is no charter for his car \u2014 and he could leave as the reigning Cup champion should he win on Sunday.",

      "Sergio Busquets was initially ruled out of Saturday\u2019s Inter Miami game against Atlanta United",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Inter Miami practiced on Friday thinking there was no way Sergio Busquets was going to play in its win-or-else playoff match against Atlanta United.",
      "A few hours later, the team got quite the surprise.",
      "Busquets \u2014 who coach Gerardo \u201cTata\u201d Martino said was ruled out for Saturday's game \u2014 received medical clearance on Friday afternoon to play and is being listed as questionable. Busquets went through a training session on his own after the rest of the team worked out Friday, meaning Lionel Messi could have one of his most trusted teammates alongside him with the season on the line.",
      "\u201cWe're confident in the progression of his recovery, and are hopeful he'll be available for (Saturday's) match,\u201d the team said.",
      "Busquets was struck somewhere around his midsection in Game 1 of the best-of-three series and developed pneumonia-like symptoms. He didn't play in Game 2 last week \u2014 a 2-1 Atlanta win \u2014 and Inter Miami has to win Saturday just to extend its season and reach the second round of the MLS Cup playoffs.",
      "\u201cAt best, there are four finals left,\u201d Martino said Friday morning, in the same interview session during which he revealed that Busquets wouldn't play \u2014 because that's what he truly thought at the time. \u201cEach of the remaining games has the characteristics of a final game and we, with the expectations we have, are ready to face it in the best way.\u201d",
      "Inter Miami hopes to have four games left this season \u2014 Saturday's conclusion to Round 1, and then a conference semifinal, conference final and the MLS Cup final. If Inter Miami keeps winning, all four of those matches would be at home. If it loses a match, the season ends there for the team that won the Supporters' Shield and posted the best regular-season record in MLS history.",
      "Atlanta has already won four elimination games this season \u2014 their two must-win matches to keep hope alive at the end of the regular season against the New York Red Bulls and Orlando City, then a wild-card match at Montreal and Game 2 of this series against Inter Miami.",
      "The difference is that this one is an elimination match for Messi as well. And when asked this week about how Messi's numbers haven't been great in this series \u2014 no goals and one assist in the two matches \u2014 Atlanta interim coach Rob Valentino wanted no part of that storyline.",
      "\u201cMessi is fantastic,\u201d Valentino said. \"There is no slander on my end. He's a fantastic player. Whether people say he's produced, not produced, I don't want to hear it because he's fantastic.\"",
      "Atlanta is the only MLS team to beat Inter Miami twice this season, and both wins came with Messi in the lineup; the club is 2-1-1 so far this season against the No. 1 overall seed.",
      "The rest of MLS, combined, went 0-12-5 against Inter Miami when Messi was in the lineup. But Atlanta's plan against Messi seems to have worked; he has one goal on 19 shots, eight of which were on target, in the four matches between the clubs this season.",
      "\u201cWhat he brings to a game, what he brings to a team, just him standing on the field it requires your attention,\u201d Atlanta United goalie Brad Guzan said. \u201cThere's very few times that Plan A works. It's Plan B and Plan C and Plan D and you have to adjust very quickly.\u201d",
      "Busquets, the team said, will be listed as questionable, which typically means that the club's medical staff will see how he is feeling on game day before making a final determination.",

      "University of Miami president Joe Echevarria has had football season tickets since 1978, the year he graduated from the school",
      "CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- University of Miami president Joe Echevarria has had football season tickets since 1978, the year he graduated from the school. The seats he buys now are as good as most people can get, field club seats right behind one of the goalposts.",
      "He doesn't use them. He's found an even better view.",
      "Instead of his luxury seats \u2014 or even better, the suite that is afforded to him as president of the school \u2014 Echevarria can be found on Miami gamedays on the Hurricanes' sideline, home or away, trying to be presidential but more often than not reverting to fandom even to the point where he tells offensive coordinator Shannon Dawson to run the ball more.",
      "And when No. 4 Miami (9-0, 5-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) plays at Georgia Tech on Saturday, Echevarria will be on the sideline once again.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m one of those crazed fans,\" Echevarria said in an interview with The Associated Press. \"I need to pace. I need to process. I need to lament. All the second guessing that fans do, that\u2019s me. I just don\u2019t say it out loud, but I say it to myself. And I love being close to my students and the team is my students, just like the student section is my students.\u201d",
      "Echevarria \u2014 who has been part of \u201cThe U\u201d since he found his way to campus as a 17-year-old from New York's South Bronx neighborhood 50 years ago \u2014 formally became Miami's seventh president last month. He graduated from the school, was hired by Deloitte as an accountant and eventually became the business giant's CEO, and never forgot that the interview for that first Deloitte job came on the Miami campus. He serves on a slew of boards and was CEO of the university's health system before moving into the president's office.",
      "He also played a critical role in bringing Mario Cristobal, a Miami native and Hurricanes alum, back to the school, luring him away from a massive contract extension offer from Oregon with a 10-year, $80 million deal to take over as Miami's football coach in December 2021.",
      "\u201cIt starts with him being an elite human being and a legitimate difference maker and impact guy. A game changer for so many reasons,\" Cristobal said. \"And he\u2019s a guy that's poured his heart and soul into the University of Miami. I would not have hopped on a plane to come to Miami without the presence of our current president.\u201d",
      "In typical Echevarria style, he was quick to point out that he was just part of the team that brought Cristobal home. He's not big on getting credit for things. Those who work with Echevarria all say the same thing, that he just wants things done and done right.",
      "\u201cI was part of a larger team,\" Echevarria said of the operation that resulted in Cristobal coming back to Miami. \u201cAnd what it meant to me was personal in nature and emotional for me to hear Mario say it because Mario is Mario. ... I was part of something magical, no matter how this turns out. Mario saying it, to me, was heartfelt. And it reminded me that we\u2019re in this together.\u201d",
      "Echevarria isn't just about football. He still buys his season tickets to men's basketball, women's basketball and baseball. (Miami doesn't charge for tickets to any other sports, or he'd buy more.) He can never be found in any of the seats that he buys; yes, he stands for basketball and baseball games as well, dealing with his nerves and excitement.",
      "There's a reason for him wanting to be in on the action on game days. It's not to be seen; Echevarria doesn't care about that. It goes back to a lesson he learned at Deloitte, when he had an office on the 47th floor of a skyscraper in Manhattan. The real action, he figured out, was going on down on the ground. The best decisions, he learned, have to be made closest to where the mission is being delivered.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy to serve because it\u2019s personal for me and it\u2019s pure joy,\" Echevarria said. \"Whether it\u2019s the academics, whether it\u2019s the health system, or whether it\u2019s athletics \u2014 the three verticals that we really have as an institution \u2014 I'm happy to serve. The University of Miami changed my life. It took a kid from the inner city who was a minority and gave me the confidence to travel 8.3 miles from the projects I grew up in to the 47th floor of 30 Rock, which is where my office was. And it happened because of this magical place.\u201d",
      "He beams when telling that story and gets the same energy jolt when he's sitting in on classes with students, or meeting with faculty, or talking to donors. The football team at 9-0 and contending for an ACC championship \u2014 or maybe even something bigger \u2014 is a nice perk right now, but it's not the top priority for Miami's new president.",
      "\u201cIt's the mission first, always: Our students, our patients, our research, and who delivers the mission? My faculty,\" Echevarria said. \"And my coaches are faculty for the athletic part. The faculty, my academic faculty, take the student part. Coaches are faculty for the athletics. To me, it\u2019s all about pursuing excellence in everything we do.\u201d",

      "\u201cCricket should be free of politics,\u201d Naqvi said. \u201cAny sport should not be entangled with politics. Our preparations for the Champions Trophy will continue unabated, and this will be a successful event.\u201d",
      "The PCB has already spent millions of dollars on the upgrade of stadiums in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi which are due to host 15 Champions Trophy games. Naqvi hoped all the three stadiums will be ready over the next two months.",
      "\u201cAlmost every country wants the Champions Trophy to be played here (in Pakistan),\" Naqvi said. \"I don\u2019t think anyone should make this a political matter, and I don\u2019t expect they will. I expect the tournament will be held at the home of the official hosts.\u201d",
      "Eight countries \u2013 Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand and Afghanistan \u2013 are due to compete in the tournament, the schedule of which is yet to be announced by the International Cricket Council.",
      "\u201cNormally the ICC announces the schedule of any major tournament 100 days before the event, and I hope they will announce it very soon,\u201d Naqvi said.",

      "Another tight game, another loss for the Cincinnati Bengals",
      "BALTIMORE -- Another tight game, another loss for the Cincinnati Bengals. It's a frustrating pattern that has put the struggling team in danger of missing the playoffs despite the outstanding play of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase.",
      "For the second time in two games against the division rival Baltimore Ravens, the Bengals blew a big lead Thursday night and lost 35-34. Cincinnati was on the cusp of reaching .500 following an 0-3 start, but those hopes vanished as quickly as its 14-point lead in the third quarter.",
      "In their previous game against Baltimore last month, the Bengals (4-6) frittered away a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter before losing 41-38 in overtime.",
      "In this one, Cincinnati led 21-7 before running back Chase Brown had the ball stripped and lost a fumble that Baltimore recovered at the Cincy 31. Five plays later, the Ravens (7-3) scored a touchdown to ignite their comeback.",
      "\u201cWe gave them seven points right there with the fumble,\u201d Bengals coach Zac Taylor said. \u201cIt kind of went back and forth from there.\u201d",
      "And when the teams got done trading touchdowns, the Ravens were one point better after Cincinnati failed on a 2-point conversion with 38 seconds remaining.",
      "Burrow went 34 for 56 for 428 yards and four touchdowns, three of them to Chase, who racked up a whopping 264 yards receiving on 11 catches and scored on plays of 67, 70 and 5 yards.",
      "In two games against Baltimore, Burrow has thrown for 820 yards and nine TDs. Chase has amassed 457 yards and five touchdowns.",
      "And incredibly, Cincinnati went 0-2 against its AFC North foe. Burrow and Chase have been magnificent this season, yet their haughty numbers are overshadowed these two digits: 4 and 6.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s crazy,\u201d Chase said. \u201cI would never in a million years expect me to play this well and he play this well and still have the record like this.\u201d",
      "Cincinnati's inability to make a lead stand up is painfully obvious. The Bengals fell to Kansas City on a last-second field goal; lost to Washington despite getting 324 yards passing and three touchdowns from Burrow; and lost to Philadelphia when the Eagles scored the game's final 20 points.",
      "Worst of all: the twin collapses against Baltimore.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s sickening that this has happened twice to us,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe got to find a way to close out these games.\u201d",
      "Chase has a knack for getting open against the Ravens, and Burrow usually gets him the ball. But with the outcome hanging in the balance, Burrow's throw on the 2-point conversion whistled past the lesser known Tanner Hudson.",
      "Asked if he was open on the play, Chase replied, \u201cYeah, I'm always open.\u201d",
      "Chase proved to be a reliable target with the Bengals forced to play without injured wide receiver Tee Higgins. But Cincinnati was virtually defenseless against Lamar Jackson and his talented band of receivers.",
      "\u201cIt sucks losing to those guys,\u201d Chase said. \u201cBut if we keep playing and win, we\u2019ll be where we want to be.\u201d",
      "The Bengals have very little margin for error with only seven games to go. Can this team rebound and make the playoffs?",
      "Chase believes so.",
      "\u201cYeah, I do. One hundred percent,\u201d he said. \u201cWe showed it tonight, what we can do.\u201d",
      "And what they can't do, which is make a lead stand up.",
      "\u201cWe just got to figure out a way to make that last play to win,\u201d Taylor said.",

      "Australia\u2019s states and territories have unanimously backed a world-first national plan to ban children younger than 16 from most forms of social media",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia\u2019s states and territories on Friday unanimously backed a national plan to require most forms of social media to bar children younger than 16.",
      "Leaders of the eight provinces held a virtual meeting with Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to discuss what he calls a world-first national approach that would make platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook responsible for enforcing the age limit.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing social harm to our young Australians,\u201d Albanese told reporters. \u201cThe safety and mental health of our young people has to be a priority.\"",
      "The government leaders had been discussing for months setting a limit, considering options from 14 to 16 years of age.",
      "While Tasmania would have preferred 14, the state was prepared to support 16 in the interests of achieving national uniformity, Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced into Parliament within two weeks, and the age ban would take effect a year after it passes into law, giving platforms time to work out how to exclude children. The government has yet to offer a technical solution.",
      "The delay is also intended to allow time to address privacy concerns around age verification.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support to the 16-year age limit since it was announced on Thursday, suggesting the legislation will pass the Senate.",
      "The minor Greens party was critical, saying the ban would prevent the emergence in Australia of future child environmental activists like Sweden's Greta Thunberg.",
      "More than 140 academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Critics say most teenagers are tech savvy enough to get around such laws. Some fear the ban will create conflicts within families and drive social media problems underground.",
      "Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, argues that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "The government likens the proposed social media age limit to the laws that restrict the sale of alcohol to adults aged 18 and older across Australia. Children still find ways to drink, but the prohibition remains.",
      "\u201cWe think these laws will make a real positive difference,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "But Lisa Given, professor of information sciences at RMIT University, described the legislation as \u201creally problematic.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany of our social networks are actually about the provision of extremely critical information to kids,\u201d Given told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that they\u2019re also facing bullying and other challenges online, but they actually need the social supports to know how to navigate the platforms safely and so they need more support from parents, from care-givers, not less access to a single or multiple platforms,\u201d Given added.",
      "Tama Leaver, professor of internet studies at Curtin University, described the government\u2019s plan to remove 14 and 15-year-olds from their already established social media accounts was \u201cstrange.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve already developed that space in that world, to have it taken away really could do as much harm as the harms that are purportedly being fixed,\u201d Leaver said.",
      "\u201cThere are so many questions about this that have yet to be answered, but even if we had solid answers about how this might work technically and how this might get implemented socially, it's still hard to believe that this would actually keep kids safe online,\" he added.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said children would retain access to online education and health services.",
      "The legislation would also include strong privacy protections surrounding age verification.",
      "\u201cPrivacy must be paramount, including that of children,\u201d Rowland said. \u201cWe should also be very clear about the realities. These platforms know about their users in a way that no one else does.\u201d",
      "Rowland said YouTube would likely be included among the mainstream platforms defined under the legislation as age restricted services.",
      "But YouTube Kids could be exempted. Gaming and messaging services would not face age restrictions, she said,",
      "\u201cThis legislation would strike a balance between minimizing the harms experienced by young people during a critical period of their development while also supporting their access to benefits as well,\u201d Rowland said.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. officials are proposing tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West",
      "BILLINGS, Mont. -- President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles (17,000 square kilometers) of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across 226,000 square miles (590,000 square kilometers) of remaining grouse habitat spanning 11 states.",
      "Now, in the closing weeks of the Biden administration, officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling sites located outside the protected areas.",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \u201cdrill baby drill.\u201d During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's science-based proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on government lands to continue.",
      "\u201cFor too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\u201d Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with the oil and renewable energy industries, Republicans and even some environmentalists.",
      "A spokesperson for American Clean Power, a renewables industry lobbying group companies, said it had supported an earlier version of the proposal but not the final details released Friday. Spokesperson Phil Sgro said the proposal \u201cunnecessarily restricts the development of wind, solar, battery storage and transmission, undermining the ability to deploy much needed clean energy infrastructure.\u201d",
      "Most of the land at issue is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "In Wyoming, Gov. Mark Gordon said the proposal would add new layers of federal regulation and hinder practical solutions for the grouse. U.S. Sen. John Barrasso accused the Biden administration of trying to ram though the changes on its way out the door.",
      "\u201cI look forward to working with the Trump-Vance administration to reverse this reckless decision,\u201d said Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources committee.",
      "Several major conservation organizations, including the Nature Conservancy, National Wildlife Federation and Natural Resources Defense Council, issued a joint statement in support of the changes.",
      "Other environmentalists said officials had squandered a chance to put in place more meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles (122,000 square kilometers) of sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cIt's death by a thousands cuts,\u201d said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \u201cThe Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't.\u201d",
      "Federal officials predicted minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance. She said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\u201cSo they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\u201d Sgamma said. \u201cThat\u2019s disingenuous.\u201d",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles (40,000 square kilometers) in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",
      "An analysis of the mining ban will be published by the end of the year, according to the Interior Department.",
      "Greater sage grouse once numbered in the millions across all or portions of 11 Western states. Populations have dropped 65% since 1986, according to government scientists."

      "Authorities say 43 monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near a fence surrounding the site and that workers are using food to try to recapture them",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Forty-three monkeys bred for medical research that escaped a compound in South Carolina have been spotted in the woods near the site and workers are using food to try to recapture them, authorities said Friday.",
      "The Rhesus macaques made a break for it Wednesday after an employee at the Alpha Genesis facility in Yemassee didn't fully lock a door as she fed and checked on them, officials said.",
      "\u201cThey are very social monkeys and they travel in groups, so when the first couple go out the door the others tend to just follow right along,\u201d Alpha Genesis CEO Greg Westergaard told CBS News.",
      "Westergaard said his main goal is to have the monkeys returned safely with no other problems. \u201cI think they are having an adventure,\u201d he said.",
      "The monkeys on Friday were exploring the outer fence of the Alpha Genesis compound and are cooing at the monkeys inside, police said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThe primates are exhibiting calm and playful behavior, which is a positive indication,\u201d the police statement said, adding company workers are closely watching the monkeys while keeping their distance as they work to safely recapture them.",
      "The monkeys are about the size of a cat. They are all females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms).",
      "Alpha Genesis, federal health officials and police all said the monkeys pose no risk to public health. The facility breeds the monkeys to sell to medical and other researchers.",
      "\u201cThey are not infected with any disease whatsoever. They are harmless and a little skittish,\u201d Yemassee Police Chief Gregory Alexander said Thursday.",
      "Authorities still recommend that people who live near the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee shut their windows and doors and call 911 if they see the monkeys. Approaching them could make them more skittish and harder to capture, officials said.",
      "Eve Cooper, a biology professor at the University of Colorado Boulder who has studied rhesus macaques, said the animals have the potential to be dangerous and urged people to keep their distance.",
      "Rhesus macaques monkeys can be aggressive. And some carry the herpes B virus, which can be fatal to humans, Cooper said.",
      "However, Alpha Genesis states on its website that it specializes in pathogen-free primates. Cooper noted that there are pathogen-free populations of rhesus macaques that have been quarantined and tested.",
      "\u201cI would give them a wide berth,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cThey\u2019re unpredictable animals. And they can behave quite aggressively when they\u2019re afraid.\u201d",
      "Alpha Genesis provides primates for research worldwide at its compound about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northeast of Savannah, Georgia, according to its website.",
      "Locally, it is known as \u201cthe monkey farm.\u201d And there is more amusement than panic around Yemassee and its population of about 1,100 just off Interstate 95 about 2 miles from Auldbrass Plantation, a Frank Lloyd Wright house designed in the 1930s.",
      "There have been escapes before, but the monkeys haven't caused problems, said William McCoy, who owns Lowcountry Horology, a clock and watch repair shop.",
      "\u201cThey normally come home because that\u2019s where the food is,\" he said.",
      "McCoy has lived in Yemassee for about two years and while he plans to stay away from the monkeys, he has his own light-hearted plan to get them back.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m stocking up bananas, maybe they\u2019ll show up,\" McCoy said.",
      "The Alpha Genesis compound is regularly inspected by federal officials.",
      "In 2018, the U.S. Department of Agriculture fined Alpha Genesis $12,600 in part after officials said 26 primates escaped from the Yemassee facility in 2014 and an additional 19 got out in 2016.",
      "The company's fine was also issued because of individual monkey escapes as well as the killing of one monkey by others when it was placed in the wrong social group, according to a report from the USDA.",
      "The group Stop Animal Exploitation Now sent a letter Thursday to the USDA asking the agency to immediately send an inspector to the Alpha Genesis facility, conduct a thorough investigation and treat them as a repeated violator. The group was involved in the 2018 fine against the company.",
      "\u201cThe clear carelessness which allowed these 40 monkeys to escape endangered not only the safety of the animals, but also put the residents of South Carolina at risk,\u201d wrote Michael Budkie, executive director of the group.",
      "The USDA, which has inspected the compound 10 times since 2020, didn't immediately respond to the letter.",
      "The facility's most recent federal inspection in May showed there were about 6,700 primates on site and no issues.",
      "In a 2022 review, federal veterinarians reported two animals died when their fingers were trapped in structures and they were exposed to harsh weather. They also found cages weren't adequately secure. Inspectors said criminal charges, civil penalties or other sanctions could follow if the problems weren't fixed.",
      "Since then, Alpha Genesis has undergone six inspections with minor problems reported only once.",
      "In January 2023, the USDA said temperatures were out of the 45 to 85 degree Fahrenheit (7.2 to 29.5 degree Celsius) required range at some of the compound's monkey cages. The inspection found moldy food in one bin, sharp edges on a gate that could cut an animal and sludge, food waste, used medical supplies, mechanical equipment, and general construction debris on the grounds.",
      "Supporters of medical research involving nonhuman primates said they are critical to lifesaving medical advances like creating vaccines against COVID-19 because of their similarities to people. Keeping a domestic supply of the animals is critical to prevent shortages for U.S. researchers.",
      "Humans have been using the rhesus macaque for scientific research since the late 1800s. Scientists believe that rhesus macaques and humans split from a common ancestor about 25 million years ago and share about 93% of the same DNA.",
      "These monkeys have been launched into space on V2 rockets, used for AIDS research, had their genome mapped and made stars of their own reality television show. They were in such high demand in the early 2000s that a shortage led to scientists paying up to $10,000 per animal.",
      "Outside of rats and mice, rhesus macaques are one of the most studied animals on the planet, said Dario Maestripieri, a behavioral scientist at the University of Chicago who wrote the 2007 book \u201cMacachiavellian Intelligence: How Rhesus Macaques and Humans Have Conquered the World.\u201d",
      "The animals are very family oriented, siding with relatives when fights break out. And they\u2019re adept at building political alliances in the face of threats from other monkeys. But they can be painful to watch. Monkeys with lower status in the hierarchy live in a constant state of fear and intimidation, Maestripieri said.",
      "\u201cIn some ways, they kind of represent some of the worst aspects of human nature,\u201d Maestripieri said.",

      "Racist text messages invoking slavery raised alarm across the country this week after they were sent to Black men, women and students, including middle schoolers, prompting inquiries by the FBI and other agencies",
      "WASHINGTON -- Racist text messages invoking slavery raised alarm across the country this week after they were sent to Black men, women and students, including middle schoolers, prompting inquiries by the FBI and other agencies.",
      "The messages, sent anonymously, were reported in several states, including New York, Alabama, California, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. They generally used a similar tone but varied in wording.",
      "Some instructed the recipient to show up at an address at a particular time \u201cwith your belongings,\u201d while others didn't include a location. Some of them mentioned the incoming presidential administration.",
      "It wasn't yet clear who was behind the messages and there was no comprehensive list of where they were sent, but high school and college students were among the recipients.",
      "The FBI said it was in touch with the Justice Department on the messages, and the Federal Communications Commission said it was investigating the texts \u201calongside federal and state law enforcement.\u201d The Ohio Attorney General's office also said it was looking into the matter.",
      "Tasha Dunham of Lodi, California, said her 16-year-old daughter showed her one of the messages Wednesday evening before her basketball practice.",
      "The text not only used her daughter's name, but it directed her to report to a \u201cplantation\u201d in North Carolina, where Dunham said they\u2019ve never lived. When they looked up the address, it was the location of a museum.",
      "\u201cIt was very disturbing,\u201d Dunham said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s just trying to figure out what does this all mean for me? So, I definitely had a lot of fear and concern.\u201d",
      "Her daughter initially thought it was a prank, but emotions are high following Tuesday\u2019s presidential election. Dunham and her family thought it could be more nefarious and reported it to local law enforcement.",
      "\u201cI wasn\u2019t in slavery. My mother wasn't in slavery. But we\u2019re a couple of generations away. So, when you think about how brutal and awful slavery was for our people, it\u2019s awful and concerning,\u201d Dunham said.",
      "About six middle school students in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, received the messages too, said Megan Shafer, acting superintendent of the Lower Merion School District.",
      "\u201cThe racist nature of these text messages is extremely disturbing, made even more so by the fact that children have been targeted,\u201d she wrote in a letter to parents.",
      "Students at some major universities, including Clemson in South Carolina and the University of Alabama, said they received the messages. The Clemson Police Department said in a statement that it had been notified of the \u201cdeplorable racially motivated text and email messages\u201d and encouraged anyone who received one to report it.",
      "Fisk University, a historically Black university in Nashville, Tennessee, issued a statement calling the messages that targeted some of its students \u201cdeeply unsettling.\u201d It urged calm and assured students that the texts likely were from bots or malicious actors with \u201cno real intentions or credibility.\u201d",
      "Missouri NAACP President Nimrod Chapel said Black students who are members of the organization's Missouri State University chapter received texts citing Trump\u2019s win and calling them out by name as being \u201cselected to pick cotton\u201d next Tuesday. Chapel said police in the southeastern Missouri city of Springfield, home of the university, have been notified.",
      "\u201cIt points to a well-organized and resourced group that has decided to target Americans on our home soil based on the color of our skin,\u201d Chapel said in a statement.",
      "Nick Ludlum, a senior vice president for the wireless industry trade group CTIA, said: \u201cWireless providers are aware of these threatening spam messages and are aggressively working to block them and the numbers that they are coming from.\u201d",
      "David Brody, director of the Digital Justice Initiative at The Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that they aren\u2019t sure who is behind the messages but estimated they had been sent to more than 10 states, including most Southern states, Maryland, Oklahoma and even the District of Columbia. The district's Metropolitan Police force said in a statement that its intelligence unit was investigating the origins of the message.",
      "Brody said a number of civil rights laws can be applied to hate-related incidents. The leaders of several other civil rights organizations condemned the messages, including Margaret Huang, president and CEO of the Southern Poverty Law Center, who said, \u201cHate speech has no place in the South or our nation.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe threat \u2014 and the mention of slavery in 2024 \u2014 is not only deeply disturbing, but perpetuates a legacy of evil that dates back to before the Jim Crow era, and now seeks to prevent Black Americans from enjoying the same freedom to pursue life, liberty, and happiness,\u201d said NAACP President and CEO Derrick Johnson. \u201cThese actions are not normal. And we refuse to let them be normalized.\u201d",

      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Three NASA astronauts whose prolonged space station mission ended with a trip to the hospital last month declined to say Friday which one of them was sick.",
      "Astronauts Matthew Dominick, Michael Barratt and Jeanette Epps publicly discussed their spaceflight for the first time since returning from the International Space Station on Oct. 25. They spent nearly eight months in orbit, longer than expected because of all the trouble with Boeing\u2019s Starliner crew capsule and rough weather, including Hurricane Milton.",
      "Soon after their SpaceX capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico off the Florida coast, the three were taken to a hospital in nearby Pensacola along with Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin, who launched with them back in March.",
      "One of the Americans ended up spending the night there for an undisclosed \u201cmedical issue.\u201d NASA declined to say who was hospitalized or why, citing medical privacy.",
      "When asked at Friday\u2019s news conference which one had been sick, the astronauts refused to comment. Barratt, a doctor who specializes in space medicine, declined to even describe the symptoms that the unidentified astronaut had.",
      "\u201cSpaceflight is still something we don\u2019t fully understand. We\u2019re finding things that we don\u2019t expect sometimes. This was one of those times and we\u2019re still piecing things together on this,\" said Barratt, the only member of the crew who had flown in space before.",
      "Epps said everyone is different in how they respond to space -- and gravity.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the part that you can\u2019t predict,\" she said, adding, \"Every day is better than the day before.\u201d",
      "Dominick said little things like sitting comfortably in a hard chair took several days to get used to once he returned. He said he didn\u2019t use the treadmill at all during his time in space, as part of an experiment to see what equipment might be pared on a long trip to Mars. The first time he walked was when he got out of the capsule.",
      "The two astronauts who served as test pilots for Boeing's Starliner \u2014 Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams \u2014 will remain at the space station until February, flying back with SpaceX. Starliner returned empty in September.",

    "story": [
      "The assets of Alex Jones' Infowars are set to be auctioned off next week, and both supporters and detractors of the conspiracy theorist are expressing interest in bidding",
      "Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars broadcasts could end next week as he faces a court-ordered auction of his company's assets to help pay the more than $1 billion defamation judgment he owes families of victims of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting.",
      "Or maybe not.",
      "Both opponents and supporters of the bombastic internet show and radio host have expressed interest in bidding on the Infowars properties he has built over the past 25 years. They include Roger Stone, an ally of Jones and Donald Trump, and anti-Jones progressive media groups. If Jones supporters buy the assets, he could end up staying on Infowars.",
      "Up for sale are everything from Jones' studio desk to Infowars' name, video archive, social media accounts and product trademarks. Buyers can even purchase an armored truck and video cameras. For now, Jones' personal social media, including his account on X, formerly known as Twitter, with 3 million followers, are not up for sale, but court proceedings on whether they should be auctioned are pending.",
      "The auctions resulted from Jones\u2019 personal bankruptcy case, which he filed in late 2022 after the Sandy Hook families were awarded nearly $1.5 billion in damages in lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas over his claims that the school shooting was a hoax. Many of Jones\u2019 personal assets also are being liquidated to help pay the judgment.",
      "The deadline to submit bids and nondisclosure agreements on the Infowars assets is Friday afternoon. After the bids are reviewed, prospective buyers deemed qualified will be invited to a live auction that could see multiple bidding rounds next Wednesday. Any items not sold will be put up at another auction on Dec. 10.",
      "Jones has expressed confidence that supporters \u2014 whom he did not name \u2014 will buy the assets of Infowars and its parent company, Free Speech Systems, allowing him to continue using its platforms. He also appears to be preparing for losing the brand because he has set up new websites and social media accounts and has been directing his audience to them.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of buyers, people that are patriots that want it and will come in,\u201d Jones said on his show in August. \u201cIf not ... we'll work with somebody else, fire something up. And it\u2019ll be a little bit of a hiccup for the crew, and things. But that will just make us bigger.\u201d",
      "Email messages to Infowars and Jones' bankruptcy lawyer were not returned.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how much money the auctions might bring in. In court documents, Free Speech Systems listed the total value of its properties and holdings at $18 million. Proceeds from the sales will go to creditors including the Sandy Hook families, who have not yet received any money from Jones and his company.",
      "Confidentiality agreements and sealed bids generally are used in auctions to maximize bid amounts while preventing bidders from talking to each other and driving down the offers. The trustee in Jones' bankruptcy case said in court documents that the procedures for the Infowars auction were designed to attract the highest possible bids.",
      "Christopher Mattei, a Connecticut lawyer representing the Sandy Hook families, called the auctions an important milestone in their yearslong fight to hold Jones accountable. He also said the families will be seeking a portion of all Jones' future income.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, the Connecticut families have sought to hold Jones fully accountable for his lies and to protect other families from him,\u201d Mattei said. \u201cStripping Jones of the corrupt business he used to attack the families while poisoning the minds of his listeners is an important measure of justice.\u201d",
      "The families sued Jones and his company for defamation and emotional distress for repeatedly saying on his show that the 2012 shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in Newtown, Connecticut, was a hoax staged by crisis actors to spur more gun control.",
      "Parents and children of many of the victims testified that they were traumatized by Jones\u2019 hoax conspiracies and threats by his followers.",
      "Jones, who has since acknowledged that the shooting did happen, is appealing the judgments.",
      "Jones has made millions of dollars from his internet and radio shows, primarily through sales of nutritional supplements, survival gear, clothing and other merchandise.",
      "Jones and other right-wing commentators once on the fringe have catapulted in popularity as many people have moved away from traditional news sources. Trump elevated them further during his 2024 campaign by repeating some of their conspiracy theories and appearing on several of their podcasts and shows. On Thursday, Jones, a long-time Trump supporter, even accepted proposals, some perhaps tongue-in-cheek, by Donald Trump Jr. and other conservatives to be the president-elect's press secretary.",
      "Stone, the Jones and Trump ally and a conservative commentator, said on his X account and on Jones' show that he would like to put together a group of investors to buy Infowars. He did not return email and social media messages on Thursday.",
      "\u201cI understand the importance of Infowars as a beacon of the truth, as a beacon of truthful information. And therefore, I would like to do whatever I possibly can to ensure, if possible, that Infowars survives,\" Stone said on Jones' show in September.",
      "People on social media also have urged billionaire Elon Musk, owner of Tesla and X, to buy Infowars, an idea Jones has backed but Musk has not publicly responded to.",
      "On the other side, Jones' detractors have shown interest in buying Infowars, kicking Jones out and turning it into something else, such as a news site that debunks conspiracy theories or even a parody site. They include officials at two progressive media sites, The Barbed Wire and Media Matters for America.",
      "An opinion piece by The Barbed Wire in September by publisher Jeff Rotkoff had a headline that read, \"Let\u2019s Buy Infowars. Alex Jones used these exact materials to exploit his viewers, peddle conspiracy theories, and damage the lives of grieving parents. We want revenge.\u201d",
      "Rotkoff urged readers to donate money to help put in bids, but he said Thursday that The Barbed Wire, based in Jones' home state of Texas, was now unlikely to make any offers.",
      "\u201cBut we have talked to a number of similarly ideologically aligned bidders and we are certain we will be outbid,\u201d Rotkoff said in an email. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that there appear to be multiple well-resourced bidders who share our interest in undoing much of the damage to our country done by Alex Jones. We\u2019ll be rooting for those folks to be successful.\u201d",
      "He declined to say who the other potential bidders were.",
      "Who exactly has submitted bids so far has not been disclosed. Jeff Tanenbaum, president of ThreeSixty Asset Advisors, which is helping to run the auction along with Tranzon Asset Advisors, would only say there have been a large number of inquiries.",
      "If detractors buy up Infowars' properties and Jones gets the boot, he should be able to build new platforms fairly quickly, said Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor of communication and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts.",
      "\u201cAs long as there is an audience hungry for his content \u2014 and there is \u2014 he\u2019ll be able to utilize X and various fringe social media platforms,\" she said in an email."

      "The U.S. government\u2019s highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves",
      "DETROIT -- The U.S. government's highway safety agency says Tesla is telling drivers in public statements that its vehicles can drive themselves, conflicting with owners manuals and briefings with the agency saying the electric vehicles need human supervision.",
      "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is asking the company to \u201crevisit its communications\u201d to make sure messages are consistent with user instructions.",
      "The request came in a May email to the company from Gregory Magno, a division chief with the agency's Office of Defects Investigation. It was attached to a letter seeking information on a probe into crashes involving Tesla's \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d system in low-visibility conditions. The letter was posted Friday on the agency's website.",
      "The agency began the investigation in October after getting reports of four crashes involving \u201cFull Self-Driving\" when Teslas encountered sun glare, fog and airborne dust. An Arizona pedestrian was killed in one of the crashes.",
      "Critics, including Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have long accused Tesla of using deceptive names for its partially automated driving systems, including \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and \u201cAutopilot,\u201d both of which have been viewed by owners as fully autonomous.",
      "The letter and email raise further questions about whether Full Self-Driving will be ready for use without human drivers on public roads, as Tesla CEO Elon Musk has predicted. Much of Tesla's stock valuation hinges on the company deploying a fleet of autonomous robotaxis.",
      "Musk, who has promised autonomous vehicles before, said the company plans to have autonomous Models Y and 3 running without human drivers next year. Robotaxis without steering wheels would be available in 2026 starting in California and Texas, he said.",
      "A message was sent Friday seeking comment from Tesla.",
      "In the email, Magno writes that Tesla briefed the agency in April on an offer of a free trial of \u201cFull Self-Driving\u201d and emphasized that the owner's manual, user interface and a YouTube video tell humans that they have to remain vigilant and in full control of their vehicles.",
      "But Magno cited seven posts or reposts by Tesla's account on X, the social media platform owned by Musk, that Magno said indicated that Full Self-Driving is capable of driving itself.",
      "\u201cTesla's X account has reposted or endorsed postings that exhibit disengaged driver behavior,\u201d Magno wrote. \u201cWe believe that Tesla's postings conflict with its stated messaging that the driver is to maintain continued control over the dynamic driving task.\"",
      "The postings may encourage drivers to see Full Self-Driving, which now has the word \u201csupervised\u201d next to it in Tesla materials, to view the system as a \u201cchauffeur or robotaxi rather than a partial automation/driver assist system that requires persistent attention and intermittent intervention by the driver,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "On April 11, for instance, Tesla reposted a story about a man who used Full Self-Driving to travel 13 miles (21 kilometers) from his home to an emergency room during a heart attack just after the free trial began on April 1. A version of Full Self-Driving helped the owner \"get to the hospital when he needed immediate medical attention,\u201d the post said.",
      "In addition, Tesla says on its website that use of Full Self-Driving and Autopilot without human supervision depends on \u201cachieving reliability\" and regulatory approval, Magno wrote. But the statement is accompanied by a video of a man driving on local roads with his hands on his knees, with a statement that, \u201cThe person in the driver's seat is only there for legal reasons. He is not doing anything. The car is driving itself,\u201d the email said.",
      "In the letter seeking information on driving in low-visibility conditions, Magno wrote that the investigation will focus on the system's ability to perform in low-visibility conditions caused by \u201crelatively common traffic occurrences.\u201d",
      "Drivers, he wrote, may not be told by the car that they should decide where Full Self-Driving can safely operate or fully understand the capabilities of the system.",
      "\u201cThis investigation will consider the adequacy of feedback or information the system provides to drivers to enable them to make a decision in real time when the capability of the system has been exceeded,\u201d Magno wrote.",
      "The letter asks Tesla to describe all visual or audio warnings that drivers get that the system \u201cis unable to detect and respond to any reduced visibility condition.\u201d",
      "The agency gave Tesla until Dec. 18 to respond to the letter, but the company can ask for an extension.",
      "That means the investigation is unlikely to be finished by the time President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January, and Trump has said he would put Musk in charge of a government efficiency commission to audit agencies and eliminate fraud. Musk spent at least $119 million in a campaign to get Trump elected, and Trump has spoken against government regulations.",
      "Auto safety advocates fear that if Musk gains some control over NHTSA, the Full Self-Driving and other investigations into Tesla could be derailed.",
      "Musk even floated the idea of him helping to develop national safety standards for self-driving vehicles.",
      "\u201cOf course the fox wants to build the henhouse,\u201d said Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, a nonprofit watchdog group.",
      "He added that he can't think of anyone who would agree that a business mogul should have direct involvement in regulations that affect the mogul\u2019s companies.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a huge problem for democracy, really,\u201d Brooks said."

      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\u201cWe were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\u201d said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \u201cIt opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\u201d",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \u201cthe house of the golden bracelet,\u201d the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \u201cthe story that was long spun around these individuals\u201d was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\u201cThey have a better overview of what\u2019s happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \u201cWe actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\u201d",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",

      "The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would set an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian government announced on Thursday what it described as world-leading legislation that would institute an age limit of 16 years for children to start using social media, and hold platforms responsible for ensuring compliance.",
      "\u201cSocial media is doing harm to our kids and I\u2019m calling time on it,\u201d Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said.",
      "The legislation will be introduced in Parliament during its final two weeks in session this year, which begin on Nov. 18. The age limit would take effect 12 months after the law is passed, Albanese told reporters.",
      "The platforms including X, TikTok, Instagram and Facebook would need to use that year to work out how to exclude Australian children younger than 16.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "The proposal comes as governments around the world are wrestling with how to supervise young people's use of technologies like smartphones and social media.",
      "Social media platforms would be penalized for breaching the age limit, but under-age children and their parents would not.",
      "\u201cThe onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. The onus won\u2019t be on parents or young people,\u201d Albanese said.",
      "Antigone Davis, head of safety at Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said the company would respect any age limitations the government wants to introduce.",
      "\u201cHowever, what\u2019s missing is a deeper discussion on how we implement protections, otherwise we risk making ourselves feel better, like we have taken action, but teens and parents will not find themselves in a better place,\u201d Davis said in a statement.",
      "She added that stronger tools in app stores and operating systems for parents to control what apps their children can use would be a \u201csimple and effective solution.\u201d",
      "X did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday. TikTok declined to comment.",
      "The Digital Industry Group Inc., an advocate for the digital industry in Australia, described the age limit as a \u201c20th Century response to 21st Century challenges.\u201d",
      "\u201cRather than blocking access through bans, we need to take a balanced approach to create age-appropriate spaces, build digital literacy and protect young people from online harm,\u201d DIGI managing director Sunita Bose said in a statement.",
      "More than 140 Australian and international academics with expertise in fields related to technology and child welfare signed an open letter to Albanese last month opposing a social media age limit as \u201ctoo blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\u201d",
      "Jackie Hallan, a director at the youth mental health service ReachOut, opposed the ban. She said 73% of young people across Australia accessing mental health support did so through social media.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re uncomfortable with the ban. We think young people are likely to circumvent a ban and our concern is that it really drives the behavior underground and then if things go wrong, young people are less likely to get support from parents and carers because they\u2019re worried about getting in trouble,\u201d Hallan said.",
      "Child psychologist Philip Tam said a minimum age of 12 or 13 would have been more enforceable.",
      "\u201cMy real fear honestly is that the problem of social media will simply be driven underground,\u201d Tam said.",
      "Australian National University lawyer Associate Prof. Faith Gordon feared separating children from there platforms could create pressures within families.",
      "Albanese said there would be exclusions and exemptions in circumstances such as a need to continue access to educational services.",
      "But parental consent would not entitle a child under 16 to access social media.",
      "Earlier this year, the government began a trial of age-restriciton technologies. Australia\u2019s eSafety Commissioner, the online watchdog that will police compliance, will use the results of that trial to provide platforms with guidance on what reasonable steps they can take.",
      "Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the year-long lead-in would ensure the age limit could be implemented in a \u201cvery practical way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere does need to be enhanced penalties to ensure compliance,\u201d Rowland said.",
      "\u201cEvery company that operates in Australia, whether domiciled here or otherwise, is expected and must comply with Australian law or face the consequences,\u201d she added.",
      "The main opposition party has given in-principle support for an age limit at 16.",
      "Opposition lawmaker Paul Fletcher said the platforms already had the technology to enforce such an age ban.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not really a technical viability question, it\u2019s a question of their readiness to do it and will they incur the cost to do it,\u201d Fletcher told Australian Broadcasting Corp.",
      "\u201cThe platforms say: \u2019It's all too hard, we can\u2019t do it, Australia will become a backwater, it won\u2019t possibly work.' But if you have well-drafted legislation and you stick to your guns, you can get the outcomes,\u201d Fletcher added."

    "story": [
      "As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States",
      "TAIPEI, Taiwan -- The first time China faced Donald Trump in the White House, there was a trade war, a breach of protocol involving Taiwan\u2019s former leader, and a president-to-president bromance that turned sour.",
      "As President-elect Trump prepares to start his second term in office, China is bracing for unpredictability in its ties with the United States and renewed tensions over trade, technology and Taiwan.",
      "Perhaps the biggest consequence for China \u2014 if Trump stays true to his campaign promises \u2014 is his threat to slap blanket 60% tariffs on all Chinese exports to the U.S.",
      "Tariffs like that would be a blow to China\u2019s already unstable economy, which is suffering from high youth unemployment, a lengthy property slump and government debt. A 60% duty on Chinese imports could shave off 2.5 percentage points, or about half, of China\u2019s projected economic growth, according to an analysis published earlier this year by UBS.",
      "During Trump's previous term in office, the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion of Chinese products. That brought Beijing to the negotiating table, and in 2020 the two sides signed a trade deal in which China committed to improve intellectual property rights and buy an extra $200 billion of American goods. A research group a couple of years later showed China had bought essentially none of the goods it had promised.",
      "President Joe Biden retained most of those tariffs and added fresh duties this year on imports including steel, solar cells and electric vehicles.",
      "Like last time, tariffs could serve as a tool to force Beijing back to the negotiating table, said Henry Gao, a law professor at Singapore Management University who focuses on international trade.",
      "\u201cGiven the weak economic position of China this time, I think there will be more willingness to talk,\u201d he said. \u201cThus, while the tariff might have some short-term effects on the Chinese economy, the situation might improve once they reach a deal.\u201d",
      "Factoring into the trade talks could be Trump\u2019s appeals to Chinese President Xi Jinping to help negotiate a resolution to the Ukraine war, which Trump has boasted he\u2019ll be able to do quickly, without saying how.",
      "Trump previously sought Xi's help in dealing with North Korea's rogue leader Kim Jong Un. That dynamic could repeat itself, with Trump weighing trade grievances against seeking China's support in global crises, according to Wang Huiyao, founder of the Beijing-based think tank Center for China and Globalization.",
      "\u201cChina is the largest trading partner of both Russia and Ukraine,\" Wang wrote in a recent commentary. \"These close economic ties give China a unique opportunity to play a greater role in peace-making efforts.\u201d",
      "There is one scenario in which Trump has threatened to impose even higher tariffs \u2014 150% to 200% \u2014 on Chinese goods: if China invades Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing claims as its own.",
      "The U.S. does not recognize Taiwan as a country, but is its strongest backer and biggest arms provider.",
      "Trump angered Beijing in December 2016 by taking a congratulatory call from Taiwan\u2019s then-president Tsai Ing-wen in a breach of diplomatic protocol. No U.S. president had spoken directly to a Taiwanese leader since Washington and Beijing established ties in 1979.",
      "Trump's move created anxiety in China-watching circles, but ultimately, he stuck to supporting the status quo in relations between Taipei and Beijing.",
      "China expects him to continue to do so, said Zhu Feng, dean of the School of International Relations at Nanjing University.",
      "\u201cWill (he) want to turn to support Taiwan independence? It is unlikely,\u201d he said.",
      "As for China\u2019s repeated threats to annex Taiwan, Trump told The Wall Street Journal last month that he would not have to use military force to prevent a blockade of Taiwan because Xi \u201crespects me and he knows I\u2019m (expletive) crazy.\u201d",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump sometimes talked up his personal connection with Xi, which started exuberantly during his first term but soured over disputes about trade and the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense, and purchased hundreds of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. weapons this year.",
      "In a congratulatory message to Trump after his victory, Xi called for the U.S. and China to manage their differences and get along in a new era, according to Chinese state media. History has shown that both sides gain from cooperation and lose from confrontation, Xi said.",
      "Trump has purposely maintained a sense of uncertainty in his relationship with China, said Da Wei, director of the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing.",
      "\u201cWe are clear about the challenges,\u201d he said. \u201cAs for opportunities, we are yet to see them clearly.\u201d",
      "During his first term, Trump began targeting Chinese technology firms over security concerns, focusing on large companies like the telecoms giant Huawei. Biden continued in that direction by placing curbs on China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors, which are needed to develop strategic industries such as artificial intelligence.",
      "But Trump has criticized Biden\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, a bipartisan bill that earmarked $53 billion to build up domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. Currently, Taiwan produces nearly 90% of the world\u2019s supply of the most advanced chips.",
      "The island\u2019s largest semiconductor manufacturer, TSMC, expanded production in Arizona, partly to respond to the CHIPS Act, and to be prepared to withstand any other protectionist policies in the U.S., said Shihoko Goto, director of the Indo-Pacific Program at the Wilson Center.",
      "Trump has promised to do away with the CHIPS Act, though critics say that would undermine his campaign to reindustrialize the U.S. The president-elect has also accused Taiwan of \u201cstealing\u201d the chip industry from the U.S. decades ago.",
      "\u201cRather than providing a silicon shield, Taiwan\u2019s dominance in the chip industry could actually be the source of tension between Taipei and Trump, as Taiwan\u2019s successes in the chip sector may be seen as having only been possible as a result of the United States being taken advantage of,\u201d Goto said."

      "\u201cThis method of warfare and conflicts may open the way for many who are evading international humanitarian law to adopt this method of warfare,\u201d the minister told reporters at the U.N. compound in Geneva.",

      "The monkeys are females weighing about 7 pounds (3 kilograms) and are so young and small that they haven't been used for testing, police said.",
      "Alpha Genesis employees \u201ccurrently have eyes on the primates and are working to entice them with food,\u201d police said in a statement issued around noon Thursday.",
      "The company usually handles escapes on site, but the monkeys got outside the compound about 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) from downtown Yemassee, Alexander said.",
      "\u201cThe handlers know them well and usually can get them back with fruit or a little treat,\u201d Alexander told The Associated Press by phone.",

      "\u201cThere is almost no danger to the public,\u201d Alexander said.",
      "People living nearby need to shut their windows and doors so the monkeys can't find a place to hide inside and if they see the primates, call 911 so company officials and police can capture them.",

      "TORONTO -- Canada announced Wednesday it won\u2019t block access to the popular video-sharing app TikTok but is ordering the dissolution of its Canadian business after a national security review of the Chinese company behind it.",
      "Industry Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne said it is meant to address risks related to ByteDance Ltd.\u2019s establishment of TikTok Technology Canada Inc.",
      "\u201cThe government is not blocking Canadians\u2019 access to the TikTok application or their ability to create content. The decision to use a social media application or platform is a personal choice,\" Champagne said.",
      "Champagne said it is important for Canadians to adopt good cybersecurity practices, including protecting their personal information.",
      "He said the dissolution order was made in accordance with the Investment Canada Act, which allows for the review of foreign investments that may harm Canada\u2019s national security. He said the decision was based on information and evidence collected over the course of the review and on the advice of Canada\u2019s security and intelligence community and other government partners.",

      "Canada's move comes a day after the election in the United States of Donald Trump. In June, Trump joined TikTok, a platform he once tried to ban while in the White House. It has about 170 million users in the U.S.",

      "TOKYO -- A robot that has spent months inside the ruins of a nuclear reactor at the tsunami-hit Fukushima Daiichi plant delivered a tiny sample of melted nuclear fuel on Thursday, in what plant officials said was a step toward beginning the cleanup of hundreds of tons of melted fuel debris.",
      "The sample, the size of a grain of rice, was placed into a secure container, marking the end of the mission, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, which manages the plant. It is being transported to a glove box for size and weight measurements before being sent to outside laboratories for detailed analyses over the coming months.",
      "Plant chief Akira Ono has said it will provide key data to plan a decommissioning strategy, develop necessary technology and robots and learn how the accident had developed.",
      "The first sample alone is not enough and additional small-scale sampling missions will be necessary in order to obtain more data, TEPCO spokesperson Kenichi Takahara told reporters Thursday. \u201cIt may take time, but we will steadily tackle decommissioning,\u201d Takahara said.",
      "Despite multiple probes in the years since the 2011 disaster that wrecked the. plant and forced thousands of nearby residents to leave their homes, much about the site's highly radioactive interior remains a mystery.",
      "The sample, the first to be retrieved from inside a reactor, was significantly less radioactive than expected. Officials had been concerned that it might be too radioactive to be safely tested even with heavy protective gear, and set an upper limit for removal out of the reactor. The sample came in well under the limit.",
      "That's led some to question whether the robot extracted the nuclear fuel it was looking for from an area in which previous probes have detected much higher levels of radioactive contamination, but TEPCO officials insist they believe the sample is melted fuel.",
      "The extendable robot, nicknamed Telesco, first began its mission August with a plan for a two-week round trip, after previous missions had been delayed since 2021. But progress was suspended twice due to mishaps \u2014 the first involving an assembly error that took nearly three weeks to fix, and the second a camera failure.",
      "On Oct. 30, it clipped a sample weighting less than 3 grams (.01 ounces) from the surface of a mound of melted fuel debris sitting on the bottom of the primary containment vessel of the Unit 2 reactor, TEPCO said.",
      "Three days later, the robot returned to an enclosed container, as workers in full hazmat gear slowly pulled it out.",
      "On Thursday, the gravel, whose radioactivity earlier this week recorded far below the upper limit set for its environmental and health safety, was placed into a safe container for removal out of the compartment.",
      "The sample return marks the first time the melted fuel is retrieved out of the containment vessel.",
      "Fukushima Daiichi lost its key cooling systems during a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, causing meltdowns in its three reactors. An estimated 880 tons of fatally radioactive melted fuel remains in them.",
      "The government and TEPCO have set a 30-to-40-year target to finish the cleanup by 2051, which experts say is overly optimistic and should be updated. Some say it would take for a century or longer.",
      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said there have been some delays but \u201cthere will be no impact on the entire decommissioning process.\u201d",
      "No specific plans for the full removal of the fuel debris or its final disposal have been decided."

      "It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- It\u2019s no surprise that students are pushing back on cellphone bans in classrooms. But school administrators in one South Florida county working to pull students\u2019 eyes away from their screens are facing some resistance from another group as well \u2013 parents.",
      "Since the beginning of the 2024 school year in August, students in Broward County Public Schools, the country\u2019s sixth largest district, have been barred from using cellphones during the school day, including during lunch and breaks, unless given special permission.",
      "The schools are some of the many across the country wrestling with how to crack down on cellphones, at a time when experts say social media use among young people is nearly universal \u2013 and that screen time is linked to higher rates of anxiety and depression among kids.",
      "But a survey sent out by the South Florida school district earlier this fall found that of the more than 70,000 students, teachers and parents surveyed, nearly one in five parents believe the cellphone ban is having a negative impact on their student\u2019s wellbeing.",
      "Among the top concerns for the students and parents surveyed is not being able to communicate with their family members, especially in an emergency \u2014 an anxiety that cuts deep in the district that\u2019s home to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, where a 2018 shooting killed 17 people.",
      "District officials have said students can use their phones during an emergency and that teachers have the flexibility to grant kids access for other reasons too.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think any of us thinks kids should be on their phones during class,\u201d said Erin Gohl, a parent and advocate in the district.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re really talking about giving kids tools during those times when they need it,\u201d she added, including letting students use their phones for \u201cpositive mental health purposes\u201d.",
      "Officials in the Fort Lauderdale-area district have acknowledged that implementation of the policy has been inconsistent. Some teachers have struggled to monitor students\u2019 phone use, and are facing the reality that for some kids, phones can be a needed tool to access online lessons and turn in assignments, especially for those who don\u2019t have a school-issued laptop. And parents have argued their students are better off with their phones, helping them coordinate afternoon pickup times or text their parents for advice about a school bully.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t expect students to say \u2014 or parents of high schoolers to say \u2014 right, that, they don\u2019t want their kids to have cellphones,\u201d said Howard Hepburn, Broward superintendent of schools. \u201cThe expectation that we\u2019re going to just have a hard stop is not reality. It takes time.\u201d",
      "Landyn Spellberg, a student advisor to the Broward school board, said there are a lot of benefits to phones \u2014 and that the district's blanket ban isn't helping students with something many adults still struggle with: learning how to use technology in a healthy way.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s important that we teach students about the negatives,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t inform students of those things.\u201d",

      "RENO, Nev. -- Conservationists and an advocacy group for Native Americans are suing the U.S. to try to block a Nevada lithium mine they say will drive an endangered desert wildflower to extinction, disrupt groundwater flows and threaten cultural resources.",
      "The Center for Biological Diversity promised the court battle a week ago when the U.S. Interior Department approved Ioneer Ltd.\u2019s Rhyolite Ridge lithium-boron mine at the only place Tiehm's buckwheat is known to exist in the world, near the California line halfway between Reno and Las Vegas.",
      "It is the latest in a series of legal fights over projects President Joe Biden\u2019s administration is pushing under his clean energy agenda intended to cut reliance on fossil fuels, in part by increasing the production of lithium to make electric vehicle batteries and solar panels.",
      "The new lawsuit says the Interior Department\u2019s approval of the mine marks a dramatic about-face by U.S wildlife experts who warned nearly two years ago that Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat was \u201cin danger of extinction now\u201d when they listed it as an endangered species in December 2022.",
      "\u201cOne cannot save the planet from climate change while simultaneously destroying biodiversity,\u201d said Fermina Stevens, director of the Western Shoshone Defense Project, which joined the center in the lawsuit filed Thursday in federal court in Reno.",
      "\u201cThe use of minerals, whether for EVs or solar panels, does not justify this disregard for Indigenous cultural areas and keystone environmental laws,\u201d said John Hadder, director of the Great Basin Resource Watch, another co-plaintiff.",
      "Rita Henderson, spokeswoman for Interior's Bureau of Land Management in Reno, said Friday the agency had no immediate comment.",
      "Ioneer Vice President Chad Yeftich said the Australia-based mining company intends to intervene on behalf of the U.S. and \u201cvigorously defend\u201d approval of the project, \u201cwhich was based on its careful and thorough permitting process.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that the BLM will prevail,\u201d Yeftich said. He added that he doesn't expect the lawsuit will postpone plans to begin construction next year.",
      "The lawsuit says the mine will harm sites sacred to the Western Shoshone people. That includes Cave Spring, a natural spring less than a mile (1.6 kilometers) away described as \u201ca site of intergenerational transmission of cultural and spiritual knowledge.\"",
      "But it centers on alleged violations of the Endangered Species Act. It details the Fish and Wildlife Service's departure from the dire picture it painted earlier of threats to the 6-inch-tall (15-centimeter-tall) wildflower with cream or yellow blooms bordering the open-pit mine Ioneer plans to dig three times as deep as the length of a football field.",
      "The mine's permit anticipates up to one-fifth of the nearly 1.5 square miles (3.6 square kilometers) the agency designated as critical habitat surrounding the plants \u2014 home to various pollinators important to their survival \u2014 would be lost for decades, some permanently.",
      "When proposing protection of the 910 acres (368 hectares) of critical habitat, the service said \"this unit is essential to the conservation and recovery of Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat.\u201d The agency formalized the designation when it listed the plant in December 2022, dismissing the alternative of less-stringent threatened status.",
      "\u201cWe find that a threatened species status is not appropriate because the threats are severe and imminent, and Tiehm\u2019s buckwheat is in danger of extinction now, as opposed to likely to become endangered in the future,\u201d the agency concluded.",
      "The lawsuit also discloses for the first time that the plant's population, numbering fewer than 30,000 in the government's latest estimates, has suffered additional losses since August that were not considered in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's biological opinion.",
      "The damage is similar to what the bureau concluded was caused by rodents eating the plants in a 2020 incident that reduced the population as much as 60%, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service said in its August biological opinion that while the project \u201cwill result in the long-term disturbance (approximately 23 years) of 146 acres (59 hectares) of the plant community ... and the permanent loss of 45 acres (18 hectares), we do not expect the adverse effects to appreciably diminish the value of critical habitat as a whole.\u201d",

      "LARNACA, Cyprus -- From as far as Algeria, Iraq and Georgia, an assortment of senior government officials converge on this small facility for training by top U.S. experts to prevent the kinds of materials used to build weapons of mass destruction from crossing their borders.",
      "In just its third year of operation, the U.S.-funded Cyprus Centre for Land, Open Seas and Port Security (CYCLOPS) has far exceeded expectations. From the dozen courses that officials were initially hoping to hold annually, demand has skyrocketed, with scheduled training sessions for next year expected to surpass 50, says the center\u2019s director Chrysilios Chrysiliou.",
      "So far, over 2,000 officials from 20 countries including Yemen, Libya, Armenia and Ukraine, have received training on radiological and nuclear detection for customs officers, methods of smuggling weapons of mass destruction, and chemical terrorism investigations among a host of other topics.",
      "On Monday, a group of Cypriot and Egyptian officials started a two-day seminar on maritime cybersecurity led by the U.S.-based Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "\u201cThis uniqueness has actually brought ... a lot of success which could not had been foreseen when Cyclops was initially being created,\u201d Chrysiliou told the Associated Press.",
      "According to Chrysiliou, key to the center\u2019s success has been the top-notch level of instruction participants receive from U.S.-based experts, including from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, that specialize in counter-proliferation programs.",
      "The center also boasts an array of the latest in cutting-edge detectors able to sniff out radiological, chemical and biological agents and explosives that countries in the wider region don\u2019t possess or have access to.",
      "\u201cHere, the participants have the opportunity to see the latest technology in in detecting all of the range of the threats,\u201d said Chrysiliou. \u201cIt\u2019s like a showcase of what exists out in the market.\u201d",
      "For instance, trainees are taught on how to detect and properly dispose of the radiological elements of discarded medical equipment that militants could use to fashion a weapon. Another emerging threat is the possible use of off-the-shelf drones to disperse chemical or biological agents over populated centers.",
      "CYCLOPS has been the product of ever-closer Cypriot-U.S. defense and security ties, earning plaudits from U.S. officials all the way up to the White House. During Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides\u2019 meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden last week, the center figured prominently as an example of enhanced bilateral security cooperation.",
      "The center was built on a $7 million U.S. government grant, $2 million of which was for the purchase of border security equipment. The island nation's proximity to the Middle East was seen as an asset to helping train officials from the region, whose options for such training would otherwise be very limited. The Cypriot government has secured another $5.6 million in European Union funding to expand the center and purchase additional high-tech equipment.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s such a huge interest by different agencies of the U.S. and the U.N. too, because they have seen the value of utilizing CYCLOPS because of its proximity to their neighboring countries,\u201d Chrysiliou said.",
      "Another selling point for the center is that it\u2019s situated a stone\u2019s throw away from Cyprus\u2019 main international airport of Larnaca and is close to top-flight accommodations that this tourism-reliant country is known for.",
      "The center's managers want to procure an expansive virtual reality system enabling officials to safely train on biological, chemical and radiological agents. Chrysiliou liaises daily with Kevin Keeler from the U.S. State Department\u2019s Export Control and Related Border Security (EXBS) program, who called the VR system a \u201cgame-changer.\u201d",
      "Although the center does have small quantities of radiological and other dangerous substances for training, a virtual simulator would greatly enhance the center\u2019s training capacity.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve already put the word out about this new virtual simulator and we have agencies like, okay, how can we get on the schedule next year when it\u2019s not even been built yet? Yes, because it\u2019s a big factor in today\u2019s world,\u201d said Keeler.",
      "It\u2019s still early days for the center to count on headline-grabbing cases where WMD materials have been seized at any given border. Chrysiliou said what\u2019s equally important in acting as a potent deterrent is to send out the message that trained professionals \u201chave the means and the ways to check and stop you.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo if we teach Iraqis or Yemenis or Libyans or from other countries to do a better job in controlling their borders, in controlling the dispersion of weapons of mass destruction ... it makes their citizens much safer and more secure,\u201d said Chrysiliou."

      "It was the latest in a series of penalties against Meta by South Korean authorities in recent years as they increase their scrutiny of how the company, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, handles private information.",
      "Following a four-year investigation, South Korea\u2019s Personal Information Protection Commission concluded that Meta unlawfully collected sensitive information about around 980,000 Facebook users, including their religion, political views and whether they were in same-sex unions, from July 2018 to March 2022.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 16:21:45 -0500",
    "summary": "How accurate were polls of the 2024 election?",
    "story": [
      "A modest error in his favor was enough to sweep the swing states.",
      "Here at 538, we think a big part of our jobs during election season is to explore and explain how much trust you should put in all the people telling you who's going to win. More than anyone else, given the amount of data they produce and the press and public's voracious appetite for it, that includes the pollsters. That's why we do things like publish ratings of pollster accuracy and transparency and make complex election forecasting models to explore what would happen if the polls are off by as much as they have been historically.",
      "Polls are also important for the reporting we do here at 538, which is rooted in empiricism and data. Furthermore, the quality of the data we're getting about public opinion is important not just for predicting election outcomes and doing political journalism, but also for many other parts of our democratic process.",
      "Suffice it to say, if polls are getting more or less accurate, the public needs to know. And now that the 2024 election is in the rearview mirror, we can take a rough first look at how accurate polling was.",
      "Just one note on scope before we get started: In this article, I will be taking just a broad look at how polls did in states where the results are final or nearly final. That means we won't assess the accuracy of national polls yet, given how many votes are still left to count in California and other slow-counting states, and won't be assessing the accuracy of individual pollsters, which we'll do when we update our pollster ratings next spring.",
      "Polls in 2024: Low error, medium bias",
      "Despite the early narrative swirling around in the media, 2024 was a pretty good year to be a pollster. According to 538's analysis of polls conducted in competitive states* in which over 95 percent of the expected vote was counted as of Nov. 8 at 6 a.m. Eastern, the average poll conducted over the last three weeks of the campaign missed the margin of the election by just 2.94 percentage points. In the seven main swing states (minus Arizona, which is not yet at 95 percent reporting), pollsters did even better: They missed the margin by just 2.2 points.",
      "This measure, which we call \"statistical error,\" measures how far off the polls were in each state without regard for whether they systematically overestimated support for one candidate. And by this metric, state-level polling error in 2024 is actually the lowest it has been in at least 25 years. By comparison, state-level polls in 2016 and 2020 had an average error close to 4.7 percentage points. Even in 2012, which stands out as a good year for both polling and election forecasting, the polls missed election outcomes by 3.2 percentage points.",
      "At this early juncture, we can only speculate as to why error was so low this year. One reason could be that pollsters have mostly moved away from conducting polls using random-digit dialing \u2014 a type of polling that has recently tended to generate results that oscillate more wildly from poll to poll than other methods. One notable pollster that does still use RDD is Selzer & Co., which had Vice President Kamala Harris leading President-elect Donald Trump by 3 points in its final poll of Iowa this year. Trump ended up winning the state by about 13 points, making for a 16-point error. It looks possible that Selzer's poll had too many Democrats and college-educated voters in it, factors the firm generally does not attempt to correct for due to Selzer's philosophy of \"keeping [her] dirty hands off the data\" (to be fair, this approach had worked excellently until this year; Selzer is one of the top-rated pollsters in 538's pollster ratings).",
      "Quinnipiac University, which also uses RDD, also generated polls that didn't seem consistent across states, though they ended up being closer to the outcome than Selzer. Meanwhile, other prominent pollsters that previously used RDD have now stopped using the method. That includes ABC News, which, after publishing an RDD poll that found now-President Joe Biden ahead of Trump by 17 points in Wisconsin in 2020 (something the pollsters behind the survey rightly identified as an outlier result when it was published), now sources its polls from Ipsos, which conducts polls online among respondents who are randomly recruited by mail and telephone.",
      "Another factor is that pollsters are increasingly balancing their samples on both demographic and political variables, such as individuals' recalled vote in the last election. While this can cause some strange results, it generally stabilizes the polls and produces fewer outliers than one would expect by random chance alone.",
      "Based on our preliminary findings, pollsters that used this aggressive approach to modeling had lower error than others. While this is just a loose proxy as we conduct a more thorough analysis, we found that pollsters who conducted their surveys with online probability panels, interviewed people with robo-calls, or included text messages or phone calls as part of a bigger mixed-mode sampling design tended to use more complex weighting schemes (and were especially reliant on recalled vote) \u2014 and also had lower error than pollsters using more hands-off modes:",
      "But the news is not all good. While polls had a historically good year in terms of error, they had a medium-to-bad one in terms of statistical bias, which measures whether polls are missing the outcome in the same direction. By our math, state polls overestimated support for Harris by an average of 2.7 points on margin in competitive states.",
      "That's lower than the statistical bias of the polls in 2016 and 2020, which underestimated Trump by 3.2 and 4.1 points, respectively. But it's higher than the bias in the 2000, 2004, 2008 and 2012 elections.",
      "This is not great news for pollsters. It means they did not fully solve their problems from 2016 and 2020 of getting enough Trump supporters to take their polls . While those problems may have been abated by pollsters weighting their data more aggressively or improving their sampling designs, they are still obviously present. You can really see this if you look at the pattern of polling bias in the competitive states from 2016 to 2024:",
      "While pollsters managed to reduce their bias in some states, especially Wisconsin, from 2020 to 2024, the pattern in the industry is still the same: Pollsters are having a hard time reaching the types of people who support Trump.",
      "You should expect errors in polling",
      "While bias in the polling industry is troubling, it is not necessarily unexpected \u2014 especially after the last few elections. And it's worth repeating that a 3-point error on the margin is indeed very small historically. Political pollsters have designed a tool that, on average, can measure public opinion among hundreds of millions of people to within 1.5 percent of its \"true\" value (converting vote margin to vote share). When you think about it that way, it's actually remarkable that polls are as accurate as they are.",
      "After the 2020 election, a year in which America's pollsters faced their worst performance since 1980, the American Association of Public Opinion Research (the professional society for pollsters and survey researchers) issued a warning to people trying to predict election outcomes in 2022 and 2024. \"Polls are often misinterpreted as precise predictions,\" it said. \"It is important in pre-election polling to emphasize the uncertainty by contextualizing poll results relative to their precision.... Most pre-election polls lack the precision necessary to predict the outcome of semi-close contests.\"",
      "In other words, polls are simply not up to the task of dispositively determining the result of a close race before it happens. In such a case, the margin between candidates would be too small for observers to conclude that one candidate was reliably ahead, given the inherent uncertainty in polling.",
      "Let's put this note of caution in the context of the 2024 election. At first glance, it may seem like polls had a bad year because they pointed to a close election and Trump looks like he will cruise to a 312-226 win in the Electoral College. But as I wrote last week, because he led in the Sun Belt swing states and was tied in Pennsylvania, polls didn't really even need to underestimate Trump at all for him to win the election. And, I warned, if they underestimated him by 2 points \u2014 which would be small compared to other misses historically \u2014 he could sweep all seven swing states.",
      "Well, it looks like that is exactly what happened. In fact, it was the modal outcome in our final forecast. AAPOR's warning is more relevant today than ever.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 20:36:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Three people have been charged in an alleged Iran-linked plot to assassinate President-elect Trump and several Iranian dissidents, according to a criminal complaint.",
    "story": [
      "Two of the individuals are now in custody, the third is an IRGC \"asset.\"",
      "Three people have been charged in a series of alleged Iran-linked murder plots, with one of them accused of trying to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump, and others targeting an Iranian-American activist and two Jewish Americans living in New York, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday in New York.",
      "Farhad Shakeri, Carlisle Rivera and Jonathan Loadholt are charged with murder-for-hire, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Rivera and Loadholt have been arrested, while Shakeri, who the FBI described as an \"asset\" of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, is believed to be in Tehran.",
      "The IRGC tasked Shakeri with surveilling and killing Trump to avenge the death of Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's elite Quds Force, in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January 2020, according to the complaint.",
      "\"There are few actors in the world that pose as grave a threat to the national security of the United States as does Iran. The Justice Department has charged an asset of the Iranian regime who was tasked by the regime to direct a network of criminal associates to further Iran's assassination plots against its targets, including President-elect Donald J. Trump,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement announcing the charges.",
      "Shakeri emigrated to the United States but was deported in 2008 after serving prison time for robbery, according to the Justice Department. While in prison, he met Rivera and Loadholt and hired them to target an Iranian American activist living in Brooklyn, according to the complaint.",
      "While she is not named in the complaint, the activist matches the description of Masih Alinejad, a prolific journalist and human rights activist who has been critical of the Iranian government and targeted in multiple plots. Federal prosecutors announced criminal charges last month against IRGC Brig. Gen. Ruhollah Bazghandi in connection with an alleged murder plot against Alinejad.",
      "Alinejad later posted on social media that she was one of the targets, writing, \"I am shocked. I just learned from the @FBI that two men were arrested yesterday in a new plot to kill me at Fairfield University, where I was scheduled to give a talk.\"",
      "The IRGC also tasked Shakeri with carrying out other assassinations against U.S. and Israeli citizens located in the United States, including Trump, the complaint alleges.",
      "In mid- to late-September, Shakeri told the FBI that the IRGC official instructed him \"to put aside his other efforts\" and \"focus on surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating former President of the United States Donald J. Trump,\" the complaint said. When Shakeri told his handler it would cost a lot of money, the IRGC official is quoted as responding \"we have already spent a lot of money ... so the money's not an issue.\"",
      "Shakeri told the FBI that during an Oct. 7 meeting with his IRGC handler he was asked to provide a plan within seven days to kill Trump. If it could not be done in that timeframe, the IRGC would pause its plan to kill Trump until after the election \"because IRGC Official-1 assessed that [Trump] would lose the election and, afterward, it would easier to assassinate [Trump],\" the complaint said.",
      "He also stated he was tasked with surveilling two Jewish-American citizens residing in New York City and was offered $500,000 by an IRGC official for the murder of either victim, according to the complaint. He was also tasked with targeting Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka, the complaint said.",
      "\"Actors directed by the Government of Iran continue to target our citizens, including President-elect Trump, on U.S. soil and abroad. This has to stop,\" U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement. \"Today's charges are another message to those who continue in their efforts -- we will remain unrelenting in our pursuit of bad actors, no matter where they reside, and will stop at nothing to bring to justice those who harm our safety and security.\"",

      "But the vice presidential nominee notably added that he'd work to find common ground with swaths of people who voted \"for the other side\" on Tuesday and that \"there should be a place in our politics for everyone to be heard.\"",

I don't think that kind of judgment is helpful right now, and I don't think it's right,\" he said, noting that he'd \"try even harder\" to keep an open mind and listen to people who don't support his policies.",
      "\"Maybe when we get a little break from this campaign that we're in, we'll be able to look at each other and see not enemies, but neighbors, and maybe we'll be able to sit down over coffee or a Diet Mountain Dew and just talk.\" he added.",

As long as I'm governor of Minnesota, we'll be a state that respects democracy, a place where we're proud of our civic debate and where we don't demonize people who disagree with us,\" he said.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro have all come out with official stances or proposed ways to counter Trump.",

      "\"The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack -- and we won't sit idle. California has faced this challenge before, and we know how to respond. We are prepared, and we will do everything necessary to ensure Californians have the support and resources they need to thrive,\" Newsom said in a statement.",

      "\"The safety and wellbeing of New Yorkers are my top priorities,\" Hochul said. \"I'm committed to working with anyone on policies that make our state stronger, safer and more livable \u2014 but my administration will also be prepared to protect New Yorkers' fundamental freedoms from any potential threats.\"",

      "In Massachusetts, Healey, who as Massachusetts' attorney general during the first Trump administration filed dozens of lawsuits against it, told MSNBC on Wednesday that she expects litigation will be filed if Trump proceeds with his mass deportation proposals but that there's also \"regulatory authority and executive powers and the like -- there's legislation also within our state\" that could work against potential threats.",
      "\"Some realities need to be noted and that is in 2016, we had a different situation in the courts, and I am sure there may be litigation ahead, there is a lot of other ways people are going to act and need to act for the sake of their states and residents,\" she said.",

      "\"Look, we know what's coming down the pike. We know it because they told us and we're going to have to be ready to defend the progress that we've made here in Minnesota. The other side spent a lot of time campaigning and talking about and promising that they would leave things up to the states. Well, I'm willing to take them at their word for that. But the moment they try and bring a hateful agenda in this state, I'm going to stand, ready to stand up and fight for the way we do things here.\" he added.",

I was not unprepared, having fought through the headwinds of the first Trump administration, the General Assembly and I took proactive steps to plan for the potential of a second Trump presidency and protect our residents from the damage that it may attempt to cause,\" Pritzker said during a press availability on Thursday, noting that Illinois had enshrined reproductive rights into the state constitution, reaffirmed labor rights, and advanced climate policy, among other items.",
      "\"Over the years ahead, we'll do more than just protect against the possible reversion to an agenda that threatens to take us backward, we will continue to advance a positive, productive and inclusive agenda of our own, one that brings opportunity to Illinois and helps uplift the nation as a whole,\" he added.",

      "Whitmer said in a thread on X that \"As governor of the great state of Michigan, my job remains the same no matter who is in the White House.\"",
      "She also noted the shift in the balance of power within her state.

This change will almost certainly stall Whitmer 's agenda in the final two years of her term.",
      "\"I am focused on getting things done that make a real difference in people's lives. With the new majority in the Michigan State House, that work will continue,\" she said.",

      "Prominent Trump allies responded within hours. \u201cThe Executive Branch should be under the direction of the president,\u201d Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah posted on X atop a screenshot of Powell\u2019s comments. Lee added: \u201cYet another reason why we should #EndTheFed.\u201d",

      "Experts who spoke to ABC News acknowledged that some legal ambiguity looms over what type of conduct warrants sufficient cause for removal, but they said a policy dispute is unlikely to meet such a standard. Still, Trump could attempt to push out Powell and test how courts interpret the law, experts added, noting that the case could end up with the conservative-majority Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cTrump could try and he might try,\u201d Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton University and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve. \u201cIt\u2019s very unlikely that he has that authority, but if he takes this to the Supreme Court, I don\u2019t know what to think of the Supreme Court.\u201d",
      "Instead, Trump could leave Powell in his position on the Fed\u2019s 7-member Board of Governors but demote him from his role as chair, Blinder said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a subtle question that has never been tested,\u201d Blinder said, acknowledging a lack of clarity about whether it would be allowed. \u201cWe can\u2019t answer that quite as definitively.\u201d",
      "If the courts reject Trump or he wants a sure path to the removal of Powell, Trump could push Congress to amend the Federal Reserve Act in a manner that weakens or eliminates the Fed\u2019s independence, experts said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Congress\u2019s prerogative,\u201d Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, told ABC News. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something written at the top of Mount Sinai.\u201d",

      "\"I feel the president should have at least [a] say in there,\" Trump said about interest rate policy during a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida in August.",
      "Could Trump successfully influence interest rate decisions, and why does it matter?",
      "Experts cast doubt on the prospect of Trump meaningfully influencing the Fed\u2019s interest rate decisions, at least in the short term.",
      "The attempted removal of Powell would likely get tied up in the courts for months, if not years, while an effort to pass new legislation would face steep odds in the Senate, where it would need to overcome a 60-vote threshold necessary to overcome a filibuster, the experts said.",
      "Powell would likely resist a campaign of public pressure undertaken by Trump, just as Powell did the first time around, experts added.",
      "Trump would also face a potentially steep decline in the stock market if he appeared to seriously threaten the independence of the Fed, some experts said. Bank executives and other business leaders would likely voice stiff opposition, fearing economic instability and runaway inflation, they added.",
      "\u201cTrying to overcome Fed independence would be highly disruptive,\u201d said Mark Spindel, chief investment officer at Potomac River Capital and co-author of \u201cThe Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve.\u201d \u201cI think the market would be an important consideration in all these efforts.\u201d",
      "Trump, however, could simply wait for his opportunity to appoint loyal personnel at the central bank, according to Claudia Sahm, chief economist at New Century Advisors and a former Fed official. In 2026, Powell\u2019s term will expire and Trump will appoint a replacement, who will then require Senate confirmation.",
      "\u201cFrankly, the easy thing is to wait a year and nominate someone else,\u201d Sahm said.",
      "The status of Fed independence holds important stakes for everyday people, Sahm added. A central bank that lacks independence is more likely to throw its dual mandate of stable inflation and maximum employment out of whack, since politicians tend to prioritize short-term economic performance over long-term steadiness, Sahm said.",
      "\u201cIf you have a central bank that does what the president wants instead of what the economy needs, then we can end up with high inflation, high unemployment and financial instability,\u201d Sahm said.",

      "She also blasted Bernie Sanders in an interview with The New York Times.",
      "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in portions of a New York Times podcast interview published Friday, blamed Vice President Kamala Harris' election loss on President Joe Biden's late exit from the presidential race and the lack of Democratic primary.",
      "Pelosi told Lulu Garcia-Navarro, a host of \"The Interview,\" that \"had the president [Biden] gotten out sooner, there may have been other candidates in the race,\" the paper said in a story about the Thursday interview. The exchange won't be posted in full until Saturday.",
      "\"The anticipation was that, if the president were to step aside, that there would be an open primary,\" Pelosi said.",
      "\"And as I say, Kamala may have, I think she would have done well in that and been stronger going forward. But we don't know that. That didn't happen. We live with what happened. And because the president endorsed Kamala Harris immediately, that really made it almost impossible to have a primary at that time. If it had been much earlier, it would have been different,\" she added.",
      "As ABC News has reported, Pelosi worked behind the scenes to urge Biden to drop out of the presidential race following his performance at CNN's debate.",
      "Back in November 2022, when ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Pelosi, \"do you think President Biden should run again?\" she answered, \"Yes, I do. I mean President Biden has been a great president for our country. He has accomplished so much.\"",
      "The Times reported Pelosi also took issue with Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders saying, after Harris' loss, that \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.\"",
      "\"Bernie Sanders has not won,\" she said. \"With all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for him, for what he stands for, but I don't respect him saying that the Democratic Party has abandoned the working-class families.\"",
      "The paper reported she suggested that cultural issues were more to blame for Democrats' losses among working-class voters.",
      "\"Guns, God and gays \u2014 that's the way they say it,\" she reportedly said. \"Guns, that's an issue; gays, that's an issue, and now they're making the trans issue such an important issue in their priorities; and in certain communities, what they call God, what we call a woman's right to choose.\"",

    "title": "How important was health, reproductive care in the election? Not very, say experts",
    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 20:41:57 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite concerns about the future of the Affordable Care Act and abortion rights, health care was not a major voting issue in this election, experts tell ABC News.",
    "story": [
      "Supporters of abortion rights ballot initiatives also voted for Trump.",
      "Americans who voted to elect Donald Trump the 47th president in Tuesday night's election expressed concerns about several major issues, including the state of democracy, the economy, immigration and foreign policy.",
      "The state of democracy in particular was the most important issue to voters, with 35% saying as much according to an ABC News preliminary exit poll, followed by 31% who said the economy was the most important issue to them.",
      "Health care, however, did not seem to be a major voting issue for many Americans. Though abortion, for example, was among the top five voting issues, only 14% said it was their most important issue, the exit poll showed.",
      "Experts told ABC News that despite concerns about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and further restrictions on abortion rights, other issues were top of mind for Americans.",
      "\"Health care issues are always a concern to people, but certainly there were other issues that were more important to people at this time,\" Dr. Perry Halkitis, dean of the School of Public Health at Rutgers University in New Jersey, told ABC News. \"It seemed like the economy and migration were the biggest issues, but especially the economy. People expressed very serious concerns about prices, very serious concerns about the affordability of things, very serious concerns about inflation.\"",
      "\"And those surpassed concerns about health care access and or reproductive rights, and many people voted based on their pocketbooks instead of their health care rights and access,\" Halkitis continued.",
      "Affordable Care Act",
      "During his first term, then-President Trump tried several times to repeal the ACA but was unsuccessful. He was promising as late November 2023 to replace it, saying Republicans \"should never give up\" trying.",
      "However, throughout 2024, Trump said on several occasions, both on social media and during the presidential debate, that he wanted to make the ACA \"better\" rather than replace it.",
      "Ultimately, worries about heath care and potential changes to the ACA didn't even crack the top five voting issues in ABC News exit polls.",
      "Halkitis said he doesn't think there will be radical changes to the ACA during Trump's second term because it's \"baked into people's lives.\" However, he does worry about legislation or policies that could limit the types of services that are available from health care providers, as opposed to a complete repeal or dismantling of the ACA.",
      "\"One example is that in the state of Texas, about a year ago, the district court decided that the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which is the use of one pill once a day to prevent HIV, did not have to be covered by insurance of a particular company,\" Halkitis said. \"I think things like that that speak to people's beliefs, whether correct or incorrect, [that] may affect the kinds of health care services that are provided to people, if the president-elect is to make any changes to the Affordable Care Act.\"",
      "Another example is the federal contraceptive coverage guarantee. Under a provision of the ACA, most private insurance plans must cover the full cost of most contraceptives, such as birth control, without making patients pay out-of-pocket costs.",
      "If the incoming Trump administration allows employers and schools to use religious and moral exemptions to prevent coverage of contraceptives, as the White House did during Trump's first term, this may lead to out-of-pocket costs that make contraceptives unaffordable to some, some experts told ABC News.",
      "Also at risk could be those with preexisting conditions. Under the ACA, insurers cannot charge more or deny coverage to someone or their child because of a preexisting health condition. However, Vice President-elect JD Vance has suggested placing people with chronic conditions into separate risk pools, which could raise premiums for those with preexisting conditions.",
      "\"I hope that doesn't happen because that would actually be disastrous for so many millions of Americans,\" Halkitis said. \"What I think would happen is that, if they were to modify the preexisting conditions clause, and put the people in a different bracket, is that it may become unaffordable for people to have health insurance.\"",
      "Dr. Stephen Patrick, professor and chair of the Department of Health Policy and Management at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Georgia, said he thinks voters in future elections will be motivated to go to the polls if they see modifications to the ACA.",
      "For example, Patrick said public opinion is generally favorable for provisions such as parents being able to keep their children on their insurance plans until age 26, as a 2019 KFF Health Tracking Poll found, which may have inspired people to go to the polls in past elections.",
      "\"We know that as you start to make modifications to things like the Affordable Care Act, people do care as we start to modify things, or change things when it affects their health insurance,\" Patrick told ABC News. \"If you say to someone, 'keeping your kid on your health insurance until they're 26,' people generally are in favor of those types of policies.\"",
      "Reproductive rights",
      "Some political strategists believed that the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overruling Roe v. Wade would drive voters who support abortion rights to the polls to vote for Kamala Harris. Trump himself took credit for the ruling, boasting that he \"was able to kill Roe v. Wade.\"",
      "While supporters of legal abortion still broke strongly for Harris, Trump's approach focusing on states' rights appeared to resonate with voters who didn't view abortion access as incompatible with a Trump presidency.",
      "In Arizona, 23% who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative enshrining abortion rights in the state constitution also voted for Trump. In Nevada, where another abortion-rights measure was approved, 25% of \"yes\" voters likewise went for Trump, according to the ABC News exit poll.",
      "\"I think what we're seeing [in] the exit polls is that abortion was a very important issue among many, many voters. However, those voters did not all vote for Kamala Harris,\" Dr. Leslie Kantor, professor and chair of the Department of Urban Global Public Health at the Rutgers School of Public Health, told ABC News. \"I think that there was actually a certain amount of confusion, which was sown pretty deliberately by the Trump-Vance campaign in the final weeks, trying to convince people that, in fact, they don't oppose abortion, when the track record clearly shows that they do.\"",
      "Kantor said this is evident in statements by Trump and Vance in which they said the president-elect would veto a national abortion ban if it came across his desk, or in comments by Trump in which he said he would not use the 150-year-old Comstock Act to ban mail delivery of abortion medication.",
      "Kantor noted that, despite Trump expressing pride for appointing justices to the Supreme Court to overrule Roe v. Wade, he was less vocal about abortion rights on the campaign trail.",
      "\"In 2024, when people are seeing the devastating consequences of the overturn [sic] of Roe v. Wade, he really backed away from that position and was much less clear, and voters were clearly less clear,\" she said. \"Because when you see somebody who says, 'I think abortion should be legal in most cases,' and then voting for somebody who clearly does not believe abortion should be legal, you know that people have been confused.\"",
      "Preliminary exit poll results from ABC News show that abortion was an important voting issue for young women, with about 19% of all women voters saying it was their most important issue, rising to 42% among women younger than 30.",
      "Kantor further noted that she thinks young women are scared after reading news reports about women pushed to the brink of death or dying after medical care was denied because physicians were hesitant to act due to restrictions to state abortion laws. She added that some abortion care providers are also leaving states where abortion care is restricted.",
      "\"Young women are terrified about what's happening all around the country,\" Kantor said. \"The truth is it isn't even safe to have a wanted pregnancy in this country. \u2026So, I think young women are staring at 30 years, possibly 25 years, of having to manage their sexual and reproductive health with very few providers and very few rights.\"",
      "It may be difficult to access abortion services even in states where care is now legal. In Missouri, voters enshrined the right to reproductive freedom in the state's constitution, effectively ending the state's restrictive ban. However, abortion for now remains unavailable in the state.",
      "\"Access to services is incredibly restricted and, at some point, having a right is meaningless if you can't actually get the service,\" Kantor said.",

      "The incident occurred on Monday, a day before the general election, at an intersection where several Trump supporters were gathered in Edmonds, Washington, located about 17 miles north of Seattle.",
      "The suspect, who was not publicly identified by police, is accused of pushing and punching a 55-year-old female Trump supporter after getting into a verbal altercation, Edmonds police said.

      "Trump has previously proposed dismantling the Department of Education.",
      "Former President Donald Trump -- now projected to be the next president of the United States -- has proposed sweeping reform for the nation's educational systems.",
      "Here's a look at what areas of education his second term might impact:",
      "Department of Education",
      "Trump's Agenda47 campaign proposed eliminating the Department of Education -- which, according to the DOE website, \"establishes policy for, administers and coordinates most federal assistance to education.\"",
      "The DOE, established by President Jimmy Carter, provides programs such as Title I funding for low-achieving or high-poverty K-12 schools in need of support, as well as Pell Grants for undergraduate students in high financial need.",
      "Throughout Trump's first presidency, he proposed billions in cuts to the Department of Education's budget.",
      "In a campaign video, Trump said he wants states -- not the federal government -- to have control over schools.",
      "However, he has also outlined plans to further restrict content or classroom discussion in schools based on guidelines that would be executed at the federal level.",
      "Content restrictions",
      "Trump's campaign has outlined a plan that features prayer in public schools, an expansion of parental rights in education, patriotism as a centerpiece of education and an emphasis on the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "He has also called for the dismantling of diversity initiatives in education and federal funding cuts for schools or programs that feature \u201ccritical race theory, gender ideology or other inappropriate racial, sexual or political content.\" Republican-backed legislation across the country has similarly sought to limit these topics, and the efforts have been criticized for being vague and leading to \"censorship\" in schools and classrooms on topics concerning race, gender and politics.",
      "Similar policies and rhetoric against school content concerning race, gender, sex and more have coincided with the removal of more than 10,000 books from library shelves over the 2023-2024 school year, according to the free-expression advocacy group PEN America.",
      "Trump has also suggested that he would create a new credentialing body to certify teachers \"who embrace patriotic values and support the American Way of Life\" and reinstate his administration's 1776 Commission to align the teaching of history with the \"values\" of the founding of the United States -- though Agenda47 does not elaborate further on what such values are or define the criteria for embracing the \"American Way of Life.\"",
      "School choice",
      "Trump also backs nationwide universal school choice programs, which allow a student's allotment of public education funds to be transferred to nonpublic schooling options -- including private schools or homeschooling.",
      "This comes as voters in three states -- Nebraska, Kentucky and Colorado -- have rejected efforts to codify or expand this kind of school choice.",
      "Teacher pay and tenure",
      "Trump's Agenda47 also anticipates an end to teacher tenure laws. These laws are described by the United Federation of Teachers as state laws that prevent a school district from dismissing a tenured teacher without due process. Most states have tenure laws in place; however, at least 10 states have zero or limited tenure laws, according to the National Education Association.",
      "He also said he will adopt a merit pay for teachers. Some studies have shown that merit pay programs improve student outcomes, but critics argue there is not enough evidence and that various factors impact student performance -- including funding and resource inequity.",
      "Higher education",
      "Trump's agenda for higher education includes creating a new, free university called the \"American Academy\" and fund it by \"taxing, fining and suing\" private universities.",

With just around 91% of the vote in, the Democrat leads her Republican challenger 51% to 49%, even though Biden carried the district by 10 percentage points in 2020. The seat became open after Democratic Rep. David Trone decided to run for U.S. Senate \u2014 where he lost in the primary. At this point, every individual House win is good news for Democrats as it\u2019s still within the realm of possibility (though unlikely) that they could flip the GOP-controlled chamber.",
      "Maine will keep its state flag",
      "In what was surely the most important ballot measure of the year, Question 5 in Maine \u2014 which would have changed the Maine state flag \u2014 has failed 55% to 45%, according to the AP. The campaign started as a simple vexillological debate between the current flag, which features the state seal on a blue background, and a version of the state's original flag, which had a star and pine tree on it. However, the ballot measure became a culture war issue as conservatives bristled at the \"erasure\" of the state seal, which features a farmer and sailor on it. That can be seen in a map of the results, in which liberal areas voted for the new flag and conservative ones voted against it.",
      "King projected to win reelection in Maine's Senate race",
      "ABC News reports that independent Sen. Angus King is projected to win reelection in Maine over his Republican opponent, Demi Kouzounas. With 95% of the expected vote reporting, King has 52% to Kouzounas's 34%, while Democrat David Costello has about 11%. Had King fallen below 50%, it would've sent the race to Maine's ranked-choice voting process, but he looks on course to finish with an outright majority and victory. Because King caucuses with the Democrats, this essentially counts as a Democratic hold.",
      "An update on the math for House control",
      "As of this post, we have projections in 412 of the House's 435 seats. When we also add in two unprojected races in which the leading candidates are from the same party, that number grows to 414 (two Democrats are facing off in California's 34th District and two Republicans in Washington's 4th District). Among those seats, Republicans have a 212-to-202 seat edge, leaving the GOP needing six of the remaining 23 seats to secure the minimum 218 seats for a majority (they current control 221).",
      "Looking at the 21 other seats, 10 of them are in California, which will not finish tallying its votes for some time to come. Out of those, four have Democratic incumbents in them who are, on balance, more likely than not going to win, as may Republican Rep. David Valadao (who is currently leading by 10 percentage points in California's 22nd District). So just to play out where things may be, let's add four to the Democratic total and one to the GOP and leave the other five California seats up in the air, which puts the math at 213-206 Republican. Democrats also have leads in Maine's 2nd District, Arizona's 4th District, Oregon's 5th District and Washington's 3rd District that look more likely than not to hold up. The same is true of Republicans' edges in Colorado's 3rd District and Arizona's 1st. If we assign those still-unprojected seats, that makes it 215-210 Republicans with 10 seats left.",
      "As such, it seems like the range for Republicans is something like 216 to 223 and around 212 to 219 for Democrats, which means there is still a slim chance for Democrats to reach a majority. All told, then, the most likely outcome may be a ever-so-slightly smaller Republican majority than their current 221-to-214 advantage. Still a lot left to play out in those unprojected seats, though.",

      "Trump also led among \"double hater\" voters, poll finds.",
      "Claiming superior leadership and casting himself as the true agent of change were keys to Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election, per ABC News exit poll results.",
      "He also prevailed by a wide margin among the small group of so-called \"double haters\" -- voters with an unfavorable opinion of both candidates.",
      "In a list of four candidate qualities, 30% of voters nationally rated \"has the ability to lead\" as most important to their vote, and about as many, 28%, chose \"can bring needed change.\" Fewer picked \"has good judgment\" (20%) or \"cares about people like me\" (18%).",
      "These choices were closely tied to candidate preferences. Among those who cited leadership ability as the top candidate attribute, Trump beat Kamala Harris by 2-1, 66-33%. On bringing about change, the gap widened to 3-1, 74-24%.",
      "That huge gap on change reflects Harris' difficulties distancing herself from the unpopular Biden administration, a dynamic covered in ABC News/Ipsos pre-election polling. Seventy-four percent of Americans said they wanted Harris, if elected, to take a new direction from President Joe Biden's. Only 33% thought she would.",
      "Harris pushed back with big leads among voters who picked judgment or empathy as most important -- but there were fewer of them.",
      "Taken another way, among Trump supporters, 41% chose \"can bring needed change\" as the most important candidate attribute in their vote and 40% chose leadership, totaling to eight in 10 of all his voters.",
      "By contrast, about six in 10 Harris supporters chose judgment or caring as top qualities to them. Compared with Trump, half as many cited leadership and a third as many picked the ability to bring change.",
      "Personal favorability was another factor.",
      "In 2020, Biden was seen favorably by 52%, 6 percentage points above Trump's 46%. This year, Harris ended up rated essentially as unfavorably as Trump -- 47-52%, favorable-unfavorable, for Harris, and 46-53% for Trump. (This is a change from preliminary exit poll results, in which Trump was 11 points underwater in favorability, Harris just 2 points.)",
      "Notably, Trump won the 8% of voters who rated both candidates unfavorably, by 26 points, 56-30%.",
      "Look also at assessments of how extreme the candidates' views were: 47% said Harris' views were too extreme; 54% said that of Trump. But among those who said both were too extreme, again 8% of voters, Trump won by a broad 42 points, 63-21%.",

      "When asked to enter a plea last year, Kohberger stood silent, prompting a judge to enter a not guilty plea on his behalf. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty if he is convicted.",
      "During a pre-trial motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team made a broad range of arguments against the death penalty, saying in part that it does not fit today's standards of decency, that it is cruel to make condemned inmates sit for decades on death row awaiting execution and that it violates an international treaty prohibiting the torture of prisoners.",
      "But 4th District Judge Stephen Hippler questioned many of those claims, saying that the international treaty they referenced was focused on ensuring that prisoners are given due process so they are not convicted and executed without a fair trial.",
      "Prosecutors noted that the Idaho Supreme Court has already considered many of those arguments in other capital cases and allowed the the death penalty to stand.",
      "Still, by bringing up the issues during the motion hearing, Kohberger's defense team took the first step toward preserving their legal arguments in the court record, potentially allowing them to raise them again on appeal.",
      "The judge said he would issue a written ruling on the motions later.",

      "\u201cIf he did anything like he did to our daughter to the others, then he deserves to die,\u201d she said.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys have said he was out for a drive the night of the killings, something he often did to look at the sky.",

      "San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie after a brutal campaign over homelessness and public safety",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- San Francisco\u2019s first Black female mayor, London Breed, conceded the race for mayor to Levi Strauss heir Daniel Lurie on Thursday, pledging a smooth transition as he takes over the job.",
      "The Associated Press has not yet declared a winner because tens of thousand of ballots have not yet been counted and added to the ranked choice voting calculations.",
      "Breed, who was raised by her grandmother in public housing, could not overcome deep voter discontent and was trailing Lurie, a philanthropist and anti-poverty nonprofit founder.",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, this job is bigger than any one person and what matters is that we keep moving this City forward,\u201d Breed said, adding that she had called Lurie to congratulate him. \u201cI know we are both committed to improving this City we love.\u201d",
      "While San Francisco\u2019s streets have been cleaner and homeless tents much harder to find in recent months, Breed\u2019s fellow Democratic challengers on the campaign trail repeatedly hammered her administration for doing too little, too late as homeless tent encampments, open-air drug use and brazen retail theft proliferated during her six years in office.",
      "Political analyst Dan Schnur said there\u2019s been a demand nationwide for change in leadership.",
      "\u201cLondon Breed didn\u2019t create the crime and homelessness crises, but voters blamed her for not fixing them,\u201d he said.",
      "She faced four big-name challengers, including two San Francisco supervisors and a former interim mayor.",
      "But voters flocked to Lurie, 47, a city native from a storied family who pledged to bring accountability and public service back to City Hall. He is the founder of Tipping Point Community, which says it has invested more than $400 million since 2005 in programs to help people with housing, education and early childhood.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply grateful to my incredible family, campaign team and every San Franciscan who voted for accountability, service, and change,\u201d Lurie said in a statement. \u201cNo matter who you supported in this election, we stand united in the fight for San Francisco\u2019s future and a safer and more affordable city for all.\u201d",
      "Lurie pumped nearly $9 million of his own money into his first-time bid for mayor, which drew criticism from Breed and other opponents. But he said that as a political outsider, he needed to introduce himself to voters and in the end, some voters said they liked that Lurie\u2019s financial wealth shielded him from being beholden to special interests.",
      "Lurie is an heir to the Levi Strauss & Co. fortune through his mother, Mimi Haas, who wed Peter Haas when Daniel was a child. Peter Haas, a great-grandnephew of Levi Strauss, was a longtime CEO of the iconic clothing company who died in 2005.",
      "Both the Levi\u2019s name and Haas family philanthropic foundations are deeply embedded in San Francisco\u2019s history and identity.",
      "Lurie\u2019s father, Brian Lurie, is a rabbi and longtime former executive director of the San Francisco-based Jewish Community Federation.",
      "Breed won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Mayor Ed Lee\u2019s term.",
      "She was reelected in 2019 to a full term that has lasted five years instead of the typical four, after voters changed the election calendar to line up with presidential contests."

      "Transport Workers Union Local 234 members had voted last week to authorize a strike once their one-year contract with the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday. But the two sides agreed late Thursday to continue talks on Friday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe have not reached an agreement, but there has been sufficient movement for us to continue talking and we are not yet calling a strike at this time,\u201d union President Brian Pollitt said. \u201cWe are by no means taking the possibility of a strike off the table as we continue to fight for the best possible agreement addressing our safety and economic concerns.\u201d",
      "The transportation authority, which has repeatedly said its financial health is uncertain, said it remains hopeful that a fair deal can be reached. The agency has declined to comment in detail on the talks.",
      "Local 234 has about 5,000 members, including bus, subway, and trolley operators, mechanics, cashiers, maintenance workers and custodians.",
      "Pollitt has said the transportation authority has not moved off its opening proposal, which he said included no wage increase and offered a $1,000 signing bonus in exchange for concessions on costs for health care coverage. The union\u2019s top demand is additional steps to improve personal safety for frontline workers \u2014 many of whom face violence and harassment \u2014 and a wage increase."

      "With his commanding victory over Kamala Harris, Donald Trump has achieved a stunning political comeback that seemed unimaginable after his refusal to accept his loss in the 2020 election ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- As he bid farewell to Washington in January 2021, deeply unpopular and diminished, Donald Trump was already hinting at a comeback.",
      "\u201cGoodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,\u201d Trump told supporters at Joint Base Andrews, where he'd arranged a 21-gun salute as part of a military send-off before boarding Air Force One. \u201cWe will see you soon.\u201d",
      "Four years later, he's fulfilled his prophecy.",
      "With his commanding victory over Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump achieved a comeback that seemed unimaginable after the 2020 election ended with his supporters violently storming the Capitol after he refused to accept his defeat.",
      "In the years that followed, Trump was widely blamed for Republican losses, indicted four times, convicted on 34 felony counts, ruled to have inflated his assets in a civil fraud trial and found liable for sexual abuse. He still faces fines that top more than half a billion dollars and the prospect of jail time.",
      "But Trump managed to turn his legal woes into fuel that channeled voters' anger. He seized on widespread discontent over the direction of a country battered by years of high inflation. And he spoke to a new generation \u2014 using podcasts and social media \u2014 to tell those who felt forgotten that he shared their disdain for the status quo.",
      "And he did so while surviving two attempted assassinations and a late-stage candidate replacement by Democrats.",
      "\u201cThis was a campaign of October surprises,\" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said hours after clinching victory. \u201cWhen you think about it, whether it was indictments, convictions, assassination attempts, the switching out of the candidate \u2014 I mean it was a campaign of firsts on so many different levels.\u201d",
      "Trump had entered the general election after sweeping the GOP primaries and routing a crowded field of candidates. The indictments against him dominated news coverage and forced even his rivals to rally around him as he cast himself as the victim of a politically motivated effort to hobble his candidacy.",
      "A late June debate against President Joe Biden \u2014 which the Biden campaign had pushed for \u2014 ended disastrously for the president, who struggled to put words together and repeatedly lost his train of thought.",
      "When Trump arrived at the Republican National Convention to formally accept his party's nomination for the second time weeks later, he seemed unstoppable. Just two days earlier, a gunman had opened fire at his rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, unleashing a hail of bullets that grazed his ear and left one supporter dead.",
      "After the gunman had been killed, Trump stood, surrounded by Secret Service agents, his face streaked by blood, and raised his fist in the air \u2014 shouting \u201cFight! Fight! Fight!\u201d \u2014 as the crowd erupted into cheers. The moment became a rallying cry for his campaign.",
      "\u201cIf you want to make somebody iconic, try to throw them in jail. Try to bankrupt them. ... If you want to make somebody iconic, try to kill him,\u201d said Roger Stone, a longtime Republican operative who has known Trump for 45 years and was pardoned by the former president. \u201cAll of those things failed. They just made him bigger and more powerful as a political force. Every one of those things turbocharged his candidacy.\u201d",
      "Trump had appeared to be on a glide path to victory. But just days later, Democrats, fearing a blowout loss and panicking over Biden's age and ability to do the job for another four years, successfully persuaded the president to step aside and end his bid, making way for Harris\u2019 history-shattering candidacy.",
      "Trump campaign aides insisted they were prepared. Videos for the convention had been cut with two different versions: One featuring Biden, the other Harris, and versions attacking both were played on the big screens in Milwaukee.",
      "But the change sent Trump into a tailspin. He had spent millions, he complained, beating Biden, and now had to \u201cstart all over\u201d again \u2014 this time facing a candidate who was not only nearly two decades younger, embodying the generational change voters had said they wanted, but also a woman who would have become the country's first female president.",
      "In one particularly hostile appearance, Trump questioned the racial identity of the first woman of color to serve as vice president and to lead a major-party ticket before the National Association of Black Journalists.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black,\u201d Trump said of the daughter of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, who had attended a historically Black college and served as a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.",
      "On his Truth Social site, he amplified a post that suggested Harris had used sexual favors to advance her career.",
      "Trump's campaign aides quickly pivoted to taking Harris down. They belittled her as unserious, with ads focused on her laugh. They labeled her \u201cdangerously liberal,\" highlighting the progressive policies she had embraced when she first ran for president in 2020.",
      "They argued her \u201cjoyful warrior\u201d messaging was fundamentally at odds with the sour mood of the electorate, and responded gleefully to Harris telling voters \u201cWe are not going back\" when many voters seemed to want just that.",
      "Though Trump had left office with a dismal approval rating, that number had ticked up considerably in the years that followed, amid concerns over high prices and the influx of migrants who entered the country illegally after Biden relaxed restrictions.",
      "Harris\u2019 momentum was just a sugar high, they said. Tony Fabrizio, the campaign pollster, called it \u201ca kind of out-of-body experience where we have suspended reality.\u201d Soon, they predicted, what they dubbed the \u201cHarris honeymoon\u201d would subside.",
      "Trump\u2019s campaign insisted they did not fundamentally change their strategy with Harris as their rival. Instead, they tried to cast her as the incumbent, tying her to every one of the Biden administration's most unpopular policies. Trump, the 78-year-old former president, would be the candidate of change \u2014 and one who had been tested.",
      "Harris played right into their hands. Asked during an October appearance on \u201cThe View\" if there was anything she would have done differently than Biden over the last four years, she responded that there was \u201cnot a thing that comes to mind.\u201d",
      "Trump's campaign rejoiced when they heard the clip, which they quickly cut into ads.",
      "Harris, they believed, failed to articulate a forward-looking agenda that represented a break from the unpopular incumbent. And she struggled to distance herself from some of the far-left positions she had taken during the 2020 Democratic primary \u2014 sometimes denying positions she was on record as having taken, or failing to offer a clear explanation for her change of heart.",
      "She spent much of the final stretch of the campaign reverting to Biden\u2019s strategy of casting Trump as a fundamental threat to democracy.",
      "But the country made clear it was \"ready to move in a different direction,\u201d said longtime Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski. \u201cThey want someone who\u2019s going to change. They don\u2019t have to think back 20 or 30 years. They can think back to four and five years ago. And they want that back in the White House.\u201d",
      "After his 2020 loss, Trump's campaign worked to grow his appeal beyond the white working-class base that had delivered his first victory. The campaign would court young people and Black and Latino men, including many who rarely voted but felt like they weren't getting ahead. They seized on divisions in the Democratic Party, courting both Jewish voters and Muslims.",
      "In a scene that would have seemed unthinkable eight years ago, Trump \u2014 the man who called for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims\" entering the country and later pursued targeted travel bans \u2014 appeared onstage at his last rally of the campaign with Amer Ghalib, the Democratic, Arab American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan. Days earlier, Trump had gone to the majority Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, for a campaign stop.",
      "\u201cThey saw him as their last hope to end these wars in the Middle East and bring back peace. And this was made very clear when he came to Dearborn,\" said Massad Boulos, the father of Trump\u2019s son-in-law, who led Trump\u2019s outreach with Arab Americans. He noted Harris \"didn\u2019t even come close to Dearborn.\u201d",
      "Trump received another boost when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse either candidate, citing a lack of consensus among its 1.3 million members.",
      "While much of the campaign's messaging centered on the economy and immigration, Trump also tried to court voters with giveaways, promising to end taxes on tips, on overtime pay and on Social Security benefits.",
      "And his aides seized on the culture wars surrounding transgender rights, pouring money into ads aimed at young men \u2014 especially young Hispanic men \u2014 attacking Harris for supporting \u201ctaxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners,\" including one spot featuring popular radio host Charlamagne tha God that aired predominantly during football games.",
      "\u201cKamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you,\" the narrator said.",
      "Trump's campaign succeeded in its mission, picking up a small but significant share of Black and Hispanic voters, and forging a new working-class coalition crossing racial lines.",
      "\u201cThey came from all quarters: union, non-union, African American, Hispanic American, Asian American, Arab American, Muslim American,\u201d Trump in his victory speech. \u201cWe had everybody and it was beautiful. It was a historic realignment, uniting citizens of all backgrounds around a common core of common sense.\u201d",
      "The campaign decided early that it would focus much of its efforts on low-propensity voters \u2014 people who rarely turn out to the polls and are more likely to get their news from non-traditional sources.",
      "To reach them, Trump began a podcast blitz, appearing with hosts who are popular with young men, including Adin Ross, Theo Von and Joe Rogan. He attended football games and UFC fights, where audiences erupted into cheers at arrivals broadcast live on sports channels.",
      "The campaign also worked to create viral moments. Trump paid a visit to McDonald's, where he donned an apron, manned the fry station and served supporters through the drive-through window. Days later he delivered a news conference from the passenger seat of a garbage truck, while wearing a yellow safety vest.",
      "Clips of those appearances racked up hundreds of millions of views on platforms like TikTok, which Trump embraced, despite having tried to previously ban the app at the White House.",
      "The appearances helped to highlight an aspect of Trump's appeal that is often lost on those who aren't supporters.",
      "Jaden Wurn, 20, a student at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania who was casting his ballot for Trump, said he was drawn to the former president in part because of his sense of humor.",
      "\u201cTrump is able to just chat,\" he said. \u201cIt can be policy. It can be culture. It could be golf. It could be whatever it is, and he\u2019s just able to sit down and have a nice, good conversation. Be relatable. Crack some jokes. He\u2019s a funny guy. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d",
      "Unlike past campaigns marked by backstabbing and turnover, Trump's operation was widely praised for being his most competent and disciplined, with credit given to Florida operative Susie Wiles, who will now serve as his White House chief of staff.",
      "Haunted by lessons from 2020, aides were careful to save money for the race's final stretch even as they were dramatically outraised by Democrats and shelled out millions on legal expenses.",
      "And they took risks, including outsourcing a large portion of their paid get-out-the-vote operation to outside groups, taking advantage of an FEC ruling that allowed unprecedented coordination with a PAC formed by billionaire Elon Musk, his newest benefactor, and Charlie Kirk's Turning Point group.",
      "As the race headed into the race's final stretch, Trump's team continued to project confidence, even as public polling showing a dead heat. They were on offensive, scheduling rallies in Democratic states like Virginia and New Mexico, as well as what was intended to be the marquee event of the campaign's end: a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden.",
      "But the event \u2014 which Trump had talked of for years \u2014 was derailed long before he even took the stage as a series of pre-show speakers delivered vile, crude and racist insults, including a comedian who called Puerto Rico \u201ca floating island of garbage.\u201d",
      "Trump was livid, angry that the event had been overshadowed by vetting failures and he was being attacked for something he hadn't said.",
      "While aides insisted they saw no impact on their polling \u2014 their internal data had him leading through the final three weeks of the race, albeit with a razor-thin margin \u2014 even Trump's most diehard supporters expressed concerns that the fallout was resonating with undecided friends and family members.",
      "\u201cA couple of them were making the comment that he was against Puerto Rico or he\u2019s racist and I\u2019ve been trying to educate them,\u201d said Donna Sheets, 51, a caregiver who lives in Christiansburg, Virginia, describing friends who had yet to make up their minds in the race's final stretch.",
      "But yet again Trump caught a break. Biden, in a call organized by a Hispanic advocacy group, responded to the insults by calling Trump's supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201d",
      "Trump quickly seized on the gaffe, coming up with the idea of hiring a garbage truck to ride in. Aides quickly scrambled to find a truck and print a \u201cTrump\u201d campaign decal to tape to its side.",
      "They also presented him with an orange worker's vest \u2014 which he decided he liked so much that he continued to wear it onstage at a subsequent rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Supporters began showing up at his rallies wearing their own vests and garbage bags.",
      "Still, Trump continued what felt, at times, like self-sabotage. He doubled down on his controversial pledge to \u201cprotect women,\" saying he would do so whether they \u201clike it or not.\u201d He railed against former Rep. Liz Cheney, saying she would be less inclined to send Americans into war if she experienced what it felt like to be standing with nine rifles \u201ctrained at her face.\u201d",
      "And on the Sunday before the election, at a rally in Pennsylvania, an exhausted Trump, fully unleashed, abandoned his stump speech altogether to deliver a profane and conspiracy-laden diatribe in which he said he \u201cshouldn\u2019t have left\u201d the White House after his 2020 loss and wouldn't mind much if reporters were shot.",
      "The performance was so unhinged that Wiles was spotted coming out to stare at Trump as he spoke.",
      "While aides were alarmed, they urged him to stick with the plan. Trump, onstage the next day, seemed to acknowledge their efforts as he repeated a familiar complaint about how he\u2019s not allowed to call women \u201cbeautiful\u201d anymore, and then asked that it be struck from the record \u2014 saying, \u201cSo I\u2019m allowed to do that, aren\u2019t I, Susan Wiles?\u201d",
      "As his top aides huddled upstairs in his office at Mar-a-Lago, Trump spent much of election night holding court with friends and club members as well as Musk and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2014 leaders of a new Make America Great Again majority that bears little resemblance to the Republican Party of old.",
      "While aides described him as confident, Trump watched the TVs that had been set up in the ballroom intensely as he mingled. This was more than an election, friends noted. He was fighting for his freedom. He will be able to end the federal investigations he faces as soon as he takes office.",
      "After Fox News had called the race, Trump emerged, flanked by campaign staff and family.",
      "\u201cThis will forever be remembered as the day the American people regained control of their country,\u201d he said."

      "The measure that would repeal the so-called \u201cgovernment pensions offset\u201d has been gaining support in the House \u2014 a robust 300 lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, have signed on to it.",

      "A natural gas utility that serves more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona",
      "PHOENIX -- A natural gas utility with more than 2 million customers in Arizona, Nevada and parts of California is being fined $2 million by regulators in Arizona over concerns about piping that is known to degrade in the heat.",
      "The Arizona Corporation Commission announced Friday that it reached a consent agreement with Southwest Gas that includes the civil penalty and requires more inspections.",
      "At issue is piping that can degrade in locations with hot ambient temperatures. Federal regulators issued an advisory in 2012 alerting operators that the piping \u2014 known as Driscopipe polyethylene (PE) M7000 and M8000 \u2014 could be susceptible to degradation.",
      "It was reported that degradation and resulting leaks involved piping installed in the Southwest, particularly in the Mohave Desert region in Arizona, California and Nevada.",
      "In Arizona, state investigators concluded that Southwest Gas failed to properly map where this type of piping had been installed.",
      "Southwest Gas estimates there are more than 10,000 miles (16,100 kilometers) of the piping throughout Arizona. The utility says it has a plan to target high-risk areas for replacement or abandonment.",
      "The agreement between state regulators and Southwest Gas stems from two separate incidents in 2021, including one in Chandler in which an explosion injured four people.",
      "In addition to replacing or abandoning all newly discovered and previously unmapped spots that contain the defective piping, Southwest Gas must also notify regulators of any leaks.",
      "An amendment to the agreement that was proposed by Corporation Commissioner Kevin Thompson made clear that the company would have to propose new rates \u2014 and win regulatory approval through an administrative process \u2014 if it wants to recoup from customers any of the costs associated with fulfilling the agreement.",
      "\u201cThis matter has been before the commission long enough and the approval of this settlement is a big step in the direction of maintaining public safety and holding the utility accountable,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe customers should bear the entire responsibility for the mistakes of the manufacturer and their defective products, and I wish the utility would have pursued this path more aggressively when they had the chance.\u201d",
      "Southwest Gas also agreed to increase leak patrols throughout the year."

      "Colorado funeral home owners accused of stashing 190 decaying bodies and giving grieving families fake ashes were expected to plead guilty Friday, but the hearing was postponed because of a snowstorm",
      "DENVER -- A snowstorm forced a Colorado court to postpone a hearing Friday where funeral home owners, accused of piling 190 bodies inside a room-temperature building while giving grieving families fake ashes, were expected to plead guilty.",
      "The discovery last year shattered families\u2019 grieving processes. The milestones of mourning \u2014 the \u201cgoodbye\u201d as the ashes were picked up by the wind, the relief that they had fulfilled their loved ones\u2019 wishes, the moments cradling the urn and musing on memories \u2014 now felt hollow.",
      "The couple, Jon and Carie Hallford, who own Return to Nature Funeral Home in Colorado Springs, began stashing bodies in a dilapidated building outside the city as far back as 2019, according to the charges, giving families dry concrete in place of cremains.",
      "While going into debt, the Hallfords spent extravagantly, prosecutors say. They used customers' money \u2014 and nearly $900,000 in pandemic relief funds intended for their business \u2014 to buy fancy cars, laser body sculpting, trips to Las Vegas and Florida, $31,000 in cryptocurrency and other luxury items, according to court records.",
      "Last month, the Hallfords pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges as part of an agreement in which they acknowledged defrauding customers and the federal government. On Friday in state court, the two were expected to plead guilty in connection with more than 200 charges of corpse abuse, theft, forgery and money laundering. The hearing has been rescheduled to Nov. 22.",
      "Jon Hallford is represented by the public defender's office, which does not comment on cases. Carie Hallford\u2019s attorney, Michael Stuzynski, declined to comment.",
      "Over four years, customers of Return to Nature received what they thought were their families' remains. Some spread those ashes in meaningful locations, sometimes a plane flight away. Others brought urns on road trips across the country or held them tight at home.",
      "Some were drawn to the funeral home's offer of \u201cgreen\u201d burials, which the home's website said skipped embalming chemicals and metal caskets and used biodegradable caskets, shrouds or \u201cnothing at all.\"",
      "The morbid discovery of the allegedly improperly discarded bodies was made last year when neighbors reported a stench emanating from the building owned by Return to Nature in the small town of Penrose, southwest of Colorado Springs. In some instances, the bodies were found stacked atop each other, swarmed by insects. Some were too decayed to visually identify.",
      "The site was so toxic that responders had to use specialized hazmat gear to enter the building and could only remain inside for brief periods before exiting and going through a rigorous decontamination.",
      "The case was not unprecedented: Six years ago, owners of another Colorado funeral home were accused of selling body parts and similarly using dry concrete to mimic human cremains. The suspects in that case received lengthy federal prison sentences for mail fraud.",
      "But it wasn't until the bodies were found at Return to Nature that legislators finally strengthened what were previously some of the laxest funeral home regulations in the country. Unlike most states, Colorado didn\u2019t require routine inspections of funeral homes or credentials for the businesses\u2019 operators.",
      "This year, lawmakers brought Colorado\u2019s regulations up to par with most other states, largely with support from the funeral home industry.",

Using the contractors, they said, will ensure the weapons are fixed quickly so Ukrainian forces can continue to use them in combat.",

In addition, a number of American companies have workers in Ukraine under contracts with the Kyiv government.",

      "President-elect Donald Trump has not said what he would do on student loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over what will happen with their payments once President Joe Biden leaves office",
      "Savannah Britt owes about $27,000 on loans she took out to attend college at Rutgers University, a debt she was hoping to see reduced by President Joe Biden\u2019s student loan forgiveness efforts.",
      "Her payments are currently on hold while courts untangle challenges to the loan forgiveness program. But as the weeks tick down on Biden's time in office, she could soon face a monthly payment of up to $250.",
      "\"With this new administration, the dream is gone. It\u2019s shot,\u201d said Britt, 30, who runs her own communications agency. \u201cI was hopeful before Tuesday. I was waiting out the process. Even my mom has a loan that she took out to support me. She owes about $18,000, and she was in the process of it being forgiven, but it\u2019s at a standstill.\u201d",
      "President-elect Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have criticized Biden's loan forgiveness efforts, and lawsuits by GOP-led states have held up plans for widespread debt cancellation. Trump has not said what he would do on loan forgiveness, leaving millions of borrowers facing uncertainty over their personal finances.",
      "The economy was an important issue in the election, helping to propel Trump to victory. But for borrowers, concerns about their finances extend beyond inflation to include their student debt, said Persis Yu, managing counsel for the Student Borrower Protection Center.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of what is making life unaffordable for them is this burden of expenses that they can\u2019t seem to get out from under,\u201d Yu said.",
      "Student loan cancellation was not a focus of the campaign for either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, who steered clear of the issue at her political events. The issue came up just once in the September presidential debate, when Trump hammered Harris and Biden for failing to deliver their promise of widespread forgiveness. Trump called it a \u201ctotal catastrophe\u201d that \u201ctaunted young people.\u201d",
      "Biden promised the student loan cancellation program during his run for the presidency. From its launch, Biden's loan forgiveness faced relentless pushback from opponents who said it heaped advantage on elites and came at the expense of those who repaid their loans or did not attend college.",
      "Biden\u2019s first plan to cancel up to $20,000 for millions of people was blocked by the Supreme Court last year. A second, narrower plan has been halted by a federal judge after Republican-led states sued. A separate policy intended to lower loan payments for struggling borrowers has been paused by a judge, also after Republican-controlled states challenged it.",
      "Bob Eitel, who served during the first Trump administration as a senior counselor to the education secretary, said he expects the president-elect will move to rescind the loan cancellations.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration may pursue different avenues of loan relief, but it will not be the mass blanket types of forgiveness that the current administration has pursued,\u201d said Eitel, president and co-founder of the Defense of Freedom Institute for Policy Studies.",
      "Overall, Biden's efforts were relatively unpopular, even among those with student loans. Three in 10 U.S. adults said they approved of how Biden had handled student loan debt, according to a poll this spring from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Four in 10 disapproved. The others were neutral or didn\u2019t know enough to say.",
      "Project 2025, the blueprint for a hard-right turn in American government that aligns with some Trump priorities, calls for getting the federal government out of the student loan business and doing away with repayment plans that pre-date the Biden administration.",
      "Even without directly addressing student loans, Trump has made promises that would affect them. He has pledged to eliminate the U.S. Department of Education, which manages the $1.6 trillion federal student loan portfolio. It's unclear which entity would take that responsibility if the department were eliminated, which would require approval from Congress.",
      "\u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson for the Trump-Vance transition.",
      "Yu noted the Biden administration managed to cancel student loans for about 5 million borrowers, even though the signature forgiveness effort has been blocked. The administration did it by leaning into loan cancellation programs already in effect. For example, an existing student loan forgiveness program for public service workers has granted relief to more than 1 million Americans, up from just 7,000 who were approved before it was updated by the Biden administration two years ago.",
      "\u201cA lot of the cancellation that we saw in the last couple of years was because the Biden administration was committed to making the programs that are actually enshrined in law work for people,\" Yu said.",
      "Sabrina Calazans, 27, owes about $30,000 on federal student loans from her college days at Arcadia University in Pennsylvania. Her payments also have been on hold, but she could soon face a monthly payment of over $300.",
      "\u201cAs a first-generation American, I live at home with my family, I contribute to our household finances, and that payment is a lot for me and so many others like me,\u201d said Calazans, who is originally from Brazil.",
      "In her role as managing director for Student Debt Crisis Center, Calazans said she has been telling people to stay up to date on developments by using the loan simulator on the Federal Student Aid website and reading updated information on forgiveness qualifications and repayment programs.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of confusion about student loans,\" Calazans said, and not just among young people. \"We\u2019re seeing a lot of parents take out more debt for their children to be able to go to school. We\u2019re seeing older folks go back to school and having to take out loans as well.\u201d",

      "The Mississippi Senate discriminated against a Black attorney by paying her about half of what her white colleagues were paid for the same job",
      "JACKSON, Miss. -- The Mississippi Senate discriminated against a Black attorney by paying her about half of what her white colleagues were paid for doing the same job, the U.S. Justice Department says in a lawsuit it filed Friday.",
      "\u201cDiscriminatory employment practices, like paying a Black employee less than their white colleagues for the same work, are not only unfair, they are unlawful,\u201d said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, head of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division.",
      "Kristie Metcalfe worked as a staff attorney for the Mississippi Senate's Legislative Services Office from December 2011 to November 2019. Attorneys for the nonpartisan office write bills and handle other legal questions for the 52 senators. Many of them stay on the job for decades.",
      "The Senate office employed only white attorneys for at least 34 years before Metcalfe was hired, and she was the only Black attorney on staff during her time there, the lawsuit said.",
      "Metcalfe's starting salary was $55,000, while other Senate staff attorneys were paid $95,550 to $121,800, according to the lawsuit. The other attorneys received pay raises about a month after Metcalfe was hired, making their salary range $114,000 to $136,416. Metcalfe did not receive a raise then.",
      "The current governor, Republican Tate Reeves, presided over the Senate as lieutenant governor from January 2012 until January 2020 \u2014 most of the time Metcalfe worked for the Senate.",
      "The Associated Press sought comment about the lawsuit Friday from Reeves and current Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who is also a Republican.",
      "\u201cWe do not comment on pending litigation,\u201d said the current secretary of the Senate, Amanda Frusha White, who works for Hosemann.",
      "Metcalfe's salary remained $40,000 to $60,000 less than her lowest-paid white colleague during her years on the job, the lawsuit said. It also said the Senate hired another attorney, a white man, in December 2018 and set his salary at $101,500, which was $24,335 more than Metcalfe was being paid at the time.",
      "Metcalfe and the new attorney both had eight years' experience practicing law, although the new attorney had not yet worked for the Legislature. They were assigned the same types of work for the Senate, the lawsuit said.",
      "The lawsuit said Metcalfe complained about the pay disparity to with then-Sen. Terry Burton, a Republican. As the Senate president pro tempore, Burton was chairman of the Rules Committee, which sets staff salaries. He denied Metcalfe's request to equalize her salary with that of her new colleague, the lawsuit said. She resigned about 11 months later."

      "The U.S. Army has awarded a $435 million contract to build a TNT production plant in western Kentucky",
      "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- The U.S. Army awarded a $435 million contract on Friday to build a TNT production plant in western Kentucky that will become the first domestic source for the explosive material in decades, officials said.",
      "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, a key player in securing the funding, said the new facility in his home state is part of a broader retooling of the U.S. defense industrial base that's needed to deter adversaries abroad. Trinitrotoluene, or TNT, is used in artillery shells, bombs and grenades.",
      "Establishing domestic production of TNT is vital for national defense, the Army said. The current supply chain for the crucial explosive material is entirely reliant on overseas sources, it said.",
      "The new TNT plant in Kentucky is part of the Army's strategy to ramp up munitions production to ensure the U.S. military has \u201ctimely access to essential resources,\u201d said Maj. Gen. John T. Reim.",
      "\"It is not lost on us that victory on the battlefield begins in our production facilities,\u201d Reim said during the announcement at a VFW post near where the plant will be built. \u201cToday marks the beginning of the return of TNT production to American soil, a capability we have not had since 1986.\u201d",
      "The contract was awarded to Repkon USA to construct the plant at Graham in Muhlenberg County, about 136 miles (219 kilometers) southwest of Louisville. The project is expected to create about 200 to 250 construction jobs and about 50 permanent jobs.",
      "Republican U.S. Rep. Brett Guthrie, who served as an artillery officer, said the war between Ukraine and Russia underscores the importance of having ample supplies of explosives for artillery shells. TNT is the primary explosive fill for 155mm artillery shells, the Army says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an artillery battle that\u2019s going on and Ukraine and the West do not have as much 155(mm artillery) rounds as Russia can make,\u201d said Guthrie, whose district includes Muhlenberg County.",
      "Bryan Van Brunt, president of Repkon USA Holdings Inc., called it a \u201chistoric opportunity\u201d to build a production plant that's vital to the military and will be relied upon for decades.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful to leaders at the Army for their trust in us to establish this facility,\u201d he said in a news release.",
      "McConnell, in the twilight of his long tenure as Senate Republican leader, has stressed the need to build up the nation's defenses as a deterrent against foreign adversaries. McConnell, who has two years left in his current term, said months ago he would step down from his leadership post sometime after the election.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re up against a network of authoritarian regimes,\" the Kentucky Republican said Friday. \"North Korea, China, Russia, Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies are all communicating with each other. They hate us and they want to reform the world order in a way that benefits autocratic regimes.\u201d",
      "McConnell consistently evokes Ronald Reagan\u2019s mantra of \u201cpeace through strength\u201d to confront foreign policy risks. Notably, McConnell and President-elect Donald Trump differ on the U.S. role in the world, reflecting a fundamental struggle among Republicans over whether to follow Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d doctrine on foreign affairs or an internationalist view backed by McConnell to stand with American allies. McConnell has been steadfast in urging the U.S. to support Ukraine in its war with Russia.",
      "\u201cIf the Russians are not defeated in Ukraine, that won\u2019t be the last loss,\u201d the senator said. \u201cThat will be just the beginning. ... A way to look at this is an impending conflict between authoritarian parts of the world and democratic parts of the world.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Hunger experts are warning that there's \u201ca strong likelihood\u201d famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza where Israeli forces are conducting a major offensive",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- There is a strong likelihood that famine is imminent in parts of northern Gaza, where Israeli forces are conducting a major offensive, hunger experts warned Friday.",
      "An alert issued by the four experts called the humanitarian situation throughout the war-torn Gaza Strip \u201cextremely grave and rapidly deteriorating\u201d and worst in the north.",
      "The Famine Review Committee warned that \u201cfamine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future.\u201d",
      "The committee's four independent experts are part of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, which is made up of a network of 15 U.N. and other organizations that monitor global hunger and food security.",
      "The experts said all actors in the war in Gaza must take immediate action \u201cwithin days not weeks \u2026 to avert and alleviate this catastrophic situation.\u201d",
      "They said this includes not only combatants \u2014 Israel, Hamas and other militant groups \u2014 but those who have influence on them.",
      "Cindy McCain, executive director of the U.N. World Food Program, tweeted after the alert was issued: \u201cThe unacceptable is confirmed: Famine is likely happening or imminent in north Gaza.\u201d",
      "\u201cImmediate steps MUST BE TAKEN to allow safe, rapid & unimpeded flow of humanitarian & commercial supplies to prevent an all-out catastrophe. NOW,\u201d she said.",
      "Its alert follows an Oct. 17 report by an IPC analysis team that said Palestinians in the entire territory face acute food insecurity. That\u2019s the emergency level, Phase 4, on the five-level classification system for hunger. It said 133,000 people were classified as facing catastrophic food insecurity, which is Phase 5 along with famine.",
      "That IPC team did a risk assessment and concluded that under a reasonable worst-case scenario, all of Gaza faced a risk of famine between November and April 2025, the experts said.",
      "Since their report, the committee said, there have been a number of significant developments: Israel's offensive largely sealing off northern Gaza for a month, a lower level of aid shipments last month than at any time since the war began in October 2023, and food access reaching \u201ccritical levels and deteriorating.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military body handling aid to Gaza, COGAT, said it is preparing to open a new aid crossing into Gaza as a U.S. deadline approaches next week for Israel to increase humanitarian supplies into the territory or risk restrictions on military assistance.",
      "But COGAT did not say when the crossing will open or if aid will be delivered to north Gaza.",
      "The U.S. says Israel must allow a minimum of 350 trucks a day carrying food and other supplies. In October, 57 trucks a day entered Gaza on average, according to COGAT figures, and 81 a day in the first week of November. The U.N. puts the number lower, at 37 trucks daily since the beginning of October.",
      "It was an average of 500 trucks daily before the war, said Jean-Martin Bauer, WFP\u2019s director of food security and nutrition analysis.",
      "\u201cThe supply of the essentials in Gaza has really dwindled, and the consequence of that is very high food insecurity and the imminent famine in northern Gaza,\u201d Bauer told The Associated Press. \u201cThe message is: Act now to let aid in and let aid programs and humanitarians do what they need to do to assist the population.\"",
      "The Famine Review Committee cited people fleeing and trapped in the north, skyrocketing food prices and accelerating attacks on health and nutrition facilities and other civilian infrastructure in recent weeks, including the arrest of medical staff by Israeli forces.",
      "It called for a new IPC analysis, saying \u201cit is already abundantly clear that the worst-case scenario developed by the analysis team is now playing out in areas of the northern Gaza Strip.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can therefore be assumed that the starvation, malnutrition, and excess mortality due to malnutrition and disease, are rapidly increasing in these areas,\u201d it said. \u201cFamine thresholds may have already been crossed or else will be in the near future.\u201d",
      "Famine results from an extreme lack of food, starvation, destitution, extremely critical acute malnutrition, including among at least 30% of children and deaths.",
      "The committee called for immediate action to end the siege in northern Gaza, allow unimpeded supplies of food, water, medical and nutritional supplies to enter the entire Gaza Strip, the repair of health and sanitation facilities, and release of health staff.",
      "The experts warned that the failure to respond in the next few days will lead to further deterioration of the humanitarian situation and additional, unavoidable deaths.",
      "\u201cIf no effective action is taken by stakeholders with influence, the scale of this looming catastrophe is likely to dwarf anything we have seen so far in the Gaza Strip since Oct. 7, 2023,\u201d the committee warned."

      "\u201cSalaries for police officers across the country have been significantly impacted by a high number of resignations and retirements,\u201d Wexler said. \u201cWith the increase in entry-level salaries, executive compensation has increased also.\u201d",

      "The vote came at the end of a lengthy and tumultuous public comment period and questioning from city councilmembers, during which several people were thrown out of council chambers. McDonnell\u2019s appointment was heavily opposed by immigration advocates, who say he allowed federal authorities to operate freely while he was sheriff and shared information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",

We will not cooperate with mass deportations and on an individual level, officers will not take action to determine a person\u2019s immigration status and will not arrest them for that status,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cLos Angeles is a city of immigrants, and my job is to protect this city. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ll do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The UK could face a \u00a322bn hit to its exports if Donald Trump imposes a blanket 20% tariff on all imports into the US, according to a new analysis.",
      "UK exports to the world could fall more than 2.6% due to lower trade with the US and knock-on effects globally, economists at the University of Sussex's Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy (CITP) said.",
      "This fall could happen if the President-elect went through with his repeated campaign promise to levy a 20% tax on all imports, and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "The decline in trade would be the equivalent of an annual hit to UK economic output of 0.8%.",
      "Although Trump's aggressive pledges could be a negotiating tactic, the \"possibility of these tariffs being imposed is certainly there\", researcher Nicolo Tamberi said in a blog post.",
      "The main UK sectors likely to be hit would be fishing, petroleum, and mining, which could see exports fall by around a fifth.",
      "The pharmaceutical and electrical sectors would also be hit.",
      "Even businesses that are not exporters themselves could be affected.",
      "For example, firms supplying transportation services, which rely on strong trade flows, would take a hit.",

      "However, some sectors could benefit from reduced China exports to the US.",
      "Textiles and clothing could see gains due to reduced competition, if Chinese exports were hit by much higher Trump tariffs.",

      "But the British ambassador in the US under Trump's previous administration, Lord Darroch, has warned the UK should not underestimate the risks.",
      "\"I\u2019m a pessimist,\" he told BBC Newsnight on Thursday. \"Trump did tariffs in his first term on steel and aluminium. He wants to go much bigger this time. He believes in it - it\u2019s not a bluff. I think he will do it.\"",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves and Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey have both said they will continue to make the argument for free trade.",
      "The UK might be in a position to have to choose whether to try to cut a side deal with the Trump White House to avoid tariffs.",
      "Alternatively the UK could join with other Western and European allies to send a clear message to Trump and the US Congress that American exporters would also be badly hit by such policies.",
      "The CITP numbers only assume that the US sets tariffs on the world, and do not assume a likely trade retaliation from Europe or Asia.",
      "The IMF recently warned that a large scale trade war would drive up inflation and lead to the world economy shrinking 7%, effectively the size of the French and German economies combined."

      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "\"It\u2019s quite frightening the extent to which water affordability is going to affect people in the future.\"",

      "Mr Keil said current support on offer for customers in the form of social tariffs was \"completely inconsistent\".",
      "\"We are calling for the current system to be revamped and replaced with a much more fair system of social tariffs so it is consistent across England and Wales, which means that everyone who is struggling can be assured that that safety net is in place and support is there if they need it,\" he said.",

      "The bill hike varies by region with the regulator agreeing to a rise of 44% for Southern Water, and 11% for Northumbrian Water.",
      "Since July, some companies have asked for further increases. For example, Thames Water, the UK's largest water company, was given the go-ahead to lift bills by 23%. It has since said it needs to raise bills by 59%, in order to keep operating as normal.",
      "The BBC understands Ofwat is considering permitting bigger bill increases for some companies when it makes a final decision in December, to reflect higher financing costs.",

    "story": [
      "Environmental campaigner Julie Bolthouse points out that Northern Virginia has the world\u2019s largest concentration of data centres. This is not something she is thrilled about.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",
      "\u201cSo I am optimistic that we're going to see a little bit of progress, but I think it's going to take time.\"",

      "Martin Stables, examination assessment and engagement lead at Leeds City College, says access arrangements are tailored to each student to ensure exams replicate the way they learn in the classroom.",
      "More than 3,900 students - 38% of the total college population at Leeds City - have at least one form of bespoke exam arrangements.",
      "And while the \"holistic approach\" allows students to perform better in exams, Mr Stables says a lot of planning is needed to make sure every exam runs smoothly.",
      "In the past, the college has had to hire out a community centre to fulfil extra space requirements on exam days.",

      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",

      "Angela\u2019s sons and their adoptive parents had stayed in touch with her - writing letters and sending photos once or twice a year. But when the older of the two boys became a teenager, he told his adoptive mother he no longer wanted to write to his birth mother. Angela carried on sending cards, but heard nothing back for years.",
      "Then out of the blue, in 2020, Angela received an email from her eldest son. It turned out he had been trying to contact her, but the local authority had told him that wasn\u2019t possible.",
      "Last month, Angela met her eldest son in person - it was the first time she had seen him for 20 years.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing for me,\" Angela says, \"even more so for my daughter - she\u2019s waited her entire life to meet her brother.\u201d",
      "Adoption is the state\u2019s most powerful intervention in family life. It is a permanent break between a child and their birth family, and alters the child's identity forever.  In law they are no longer the child of their birth parents, and most adopted children grow up without seeing or knowing any of their birth family.",
      "Around 3,000 children are adopted in England each year. It\u2019s a process that must be authorised by judges in family courts, who set out the level of contact the child will have with their birth parents - usually just letters, sent twice a year, via an intermediary.",
      "While adoption law has evolved over the years - allowing children to know more about their history than they once did, in some ways, families say, adoption is still very much stuck in the past.",
      "Now a new report from a group set up by the most senior judge in the family court says wholesale reform of the system is needed.",

      "Angela Frazer-Wicks describes her experience of adoption as a \"life sentence\u2026 without any right to appeal\". As chair of trustees of the charity Family Rights Group, she is pleased mothers like her will have more chance to continue seeing their children after they have been adopted.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a seismic shift,\u201d Angela says. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a long time coming. My hope is that we start to see just a bit more compassion towards birth families - they are so often seen as the problem.\u201d",

      "Dee was advised it would be reassuring for Cassie to meet her birth mother face-to-face.",
      "Their reunion, in a noisy contact centre, went well \u2013 but the following day Cassie was very tired, pale and limp. Dee decided to take Cassie to the doctor, and by the time they arrived at the surgery Cassie was trembling and vomiting uncontrollably.",
      "But there was nothing physically wrong the doctor said - Cassie was in shock.",
      "For nearly two years Cassie and Dee went to specialist therapy. Cassie still seemed to worry about her birth mother, and would try to call her on a toy telephone.",
      "Another meeting was arranged, in a quieter environment, with support. After that, Cassie, who is now aged 30, says she didn\u2019t want to see her birth mother again.",

      "\u201cThe children become very emotionally mixed up,\u201d says Sir Andrew McFarlane, the head of the Family Court in England and Wales.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to work out who you are you in the world, and you have some memory of the family you lived with until you were four or five\u2026 it\u2019s almost natural to try and trace them and be in touch with them.\u201d",
      "Without expert help, this can have disastrous consequences.",
      "In 2021 one couple told the BBC it was \u201cdevastating\u201d to see their two adopted sons turn against them and get drawn into crime, after they had been reunited with their birth family.",

      "Woman wins six-figure payout after adoption broke down",
      "Following a four-year review and consultation, the 170-page report published today says greater consideration should be given to whether adopted children \u201cshould have face-to-face contact with those who were significant to them before they were adopted\u201d.",
      "The report is intended as a review of the adoption process and a \"catalyst for positive changes\".",
      "Among the dozens of other recommendations are reforming the law on international adoption, and setting up a national register for court adoption records to make it easier for people to find their own files. The report also recommends dropping the term \u201ccelebration\u201d for parents\u2019 last visit to court with the child they are adopting.",

      "Many adoptive parents agree the current \"letterbox\" system of contact is not effective.",

      "A Department for Education spokesperson said the value of children growing up in a loving family \"cannot be underestimated\". And for many children in care, \"adoption makes this happen\".",

      "Schools are experiencing more conflict with parents over their children\u2019s behaviour since the Covid pandemic, a public inquiry has heard.",
      "The Scottish Covid Inquiry is being told about the impact of the pandemic on all levels of education.",
      "The body representing school leaders said its members had reported a rise in parents simply not accepting their children were behaving badly since the pandemic.",
      "School Leaders Scotland (SLS) suggested that some parents were taking \"the path of least resistance\" with their kids.",
      "The inquiry started its hearings last year and has already covered the impact of the pandemic on people using health and social care services.",
      "It is now hearing from people on the frontline of education.",
      "Graham Hutton, general secretary for the SLS and a former head teacher in Dundee, told the inquiry that pupil behaviour and attendance problems had been one of the \"hidden consequences\" of the pandemic.",
      "Mr Hutton said: \"What I\u2019m hearing from my colleagues is there has been a rise in the amount of arguments they are having with parents which they probably wouldn\u2019t have had in the past.\"",
      "Mr Hutton said scenarios where parents were \"absolutely adamant that their child is right even when evidence is put to them\" were now more common.",
      "He added: \"In many ways it looks to us as if they take the path of least resistance.",
      "\"They have maybe not been able to deal appropriately with young people when they have been off school and therefore they have allowed young people to do as they wish or been rather weak with setting parameters.\"",
      "Scotland's schools faced years of disruption during the Covid pandemic, including full and partial closures, home learning and major changes to the way pupils were assessed.",
      "Mr Hutton said: \u201cThe pandemic did have negative impact right across the board, we were not prepared for it. In many ways we were fumbling around in the dark to make sure we did the best by our young people.\u201d",
      "The SLS claimed the Covid pandemic had proved that the current way Scotland's schools are arranged and pupils tested is no longer fit for purpose and requires major changes.",
      "Inquiry chairman Lord Brailsford described these arguments as \u201cforceful and potent\u201d and said they would be considered by the investigation he is leading.",
      "'Breakdown of trust'",
      "Earlier the inquiry had heard how the pandemic impacted higher and further education.",
      "Matt Crilly, who was the National Union of Students of Scotland president from July 2020 to June 2022, said fears over missing out on income from international student fees was a driver behind reopening Scotland\u2019s universities during the pandemic.",
      "He said: \u201cThe highest single source of income for many of our universities comes from international students and my understanding at that time is that there was a fear that (if) learning was to be delivered exclusively or predominately online... many international students may not want to enrol on a \u00a320,000 a year fee-paying course.\u201d",
      "Mr Crilly added that at this time there had been a \"breakdown of trust\" in those in authority by students who felt they had been told to attend in person only to find themselves in \"semi-official lockdown\".",
      "He added that students in this position felt \"isolated from the rest of society\".",
      "He told the inquiry: \"Essentially, they felt like they were being seen as the cause of the pandemic and the cause of the virus spreading.",
      "\"They felt that they were being judged because of that, despite the fact that they were told that they had to be there, and they had to arrive on campus to take part in their education.\"",
      "The inquiry also heard how many higher and further education students didn\u2019t have their own computers to be able to access learning online when face-to-face teaching was again suspended.",
      "This included one example of a student trying to write a dissertation on their mobile phone.",

    "summary": "India\u2019s ban on the import of Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses is under scrutiny - here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Is it legal to import Sir Salman Rushdie\u2019s The Satanic Verses in India?",
      "This question has been puzzling legal experts since the Delhi High Court suggested this week that the notification banning the novel\u2019s import - issued in 1988 - might no longer be valid, as the government couldn't locate it.",
      "The Satanic Verses, criticised by some Muslims as blasphemous, was banned in India shortly after its release, sparking protests worldwide. Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa in 1989, calling for Rushdie\u2019s assassination. This forced the Indian-born Booker Prize-winning author into hiding for nearly a decade.",
      "Although the book remains officially banned in India, some legal experts now believe it could be imported unless the government reaffirms the ban. Others, however, caution that practical obstacles may still exist.",
      "The ban on the book came under scrutiny after Sandipan Khan, a resident of West Bengal state, tried to buy the book but learnt that it was not published in India nor could it be imported.",
      "In 2017, he filed a Right to Information (RTI) request for the official notification banning the book\u2019s import, but was sent through a series of departments without finding it.",
      "In 2019, Khan took the matter to the Delhi High Court, arguing that the ban impacted his freedom to read.",
      "Over five years, government departments repeatedly failed to produce the notification, despite customs having similar records from as far back as 1968.",
      "Finally, on 5 November, the court declared it had no option but to \u201cpresume\u201d that no such ban notification exists and therefore couldn\u2019t assess its validity.",
      "The case raises a perplexing question: is a notification valid if no copy of it can be found?",
      "The simple answer is, we don't know yet.",
      "The court has not clarified if the book could be accessed in India but advised Mr Khan to pursue any legal options to obtain it.",
      "Uddyam Mukherjee, Mr Khan\u2019s lawyer, told the BBC that federal departments couldn\u2019t provide a clear answer either, when asked by the court.",
      "\u201cI have never come across a situation like this,\u201d said Madan Lokur, a former judge of the Supreme Court.",
      "If the notification is not found then \u201ctechnically no ban exists\u201d and the book can be imported.",
      "\u201cHowever, the government may pass a fresh notification [banning the book's import],\u201d Mr Lokur added, since the court has not declared the ban to be unconstitutional, but only said that the notification is presumed to not exist.",
      "Mr Mukherjee argued that the book could now be imported \u201cas there is no legal impediment\u201d against the book.",
      "However, some legal experts disagree.",
      "Raju Ramachandran, a senior lawyer, said he found the suggestion a \u201clittle extreme\u201d.",
      "\u201cAll that the high court says is that this particular petition has become infructuous [invalid] since the notification could not be found,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has not given the right to the petitioner to import the book.\u201d",
      "Senior lawyer Sanjay Hegde said the book could have been published in India if \u201csomeone was brave enough to print it\u201d as only its import was banned, not its publication.",
      "\u201cBut after all the brouhaha, nobody wanted to print it in India.\"",
      "In 2012, the government of Rajasthan state sought the arrest of four Indian authors - Hari Kunzru, Ruchir Joshi, Amitava Kumar and Jeet Thayil - after they downloaded a few passages from the Satanic Verses and read them out at a literary festival in the city.",
      "At the time, many legal experts were of the opinion that downloading a book whose import had been banned could not be considered a crime. But online copies of the book have been hard to find in India.",
      "Rushdie, 76, continues to face threats over his outspoken views on Islam.",
      "In 2022, he lost an eye and spent six weeks in hospital after being stabbed up to 10 times on stage at an event in New York state. The suspect, Hadi Matar, has been charged with attempted murder.",
      "In his recent memoir, the writer has criticised the response to his book, noting that \"no properly authorised body [in India] had reviewed the book, nor was there any semblance of a judicial process\"."

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 13:58:27 GMT",
    "summary": "The actress was the last surviving original cast member of BBC Radio 4 serial The Archers.",
    "story": [
      "June Spencer, who has died aged 105, was the last surviving original cast member of The Archers.",
      "For nearly 70 years, she played Peggy Woolley in the long-running radio drama: one of the best-loved matriarchs in British broadcasting.",
      "Spencer helped launch BBC Radio's \"everyday story of country folk\" on 1 January 1951. Clement Attlee was Prime Minister, and meat, cheese, sugar, and petrol were still being rationed after World War Two.",
      "As Peggy, she weathered the ups and downs of life in Ambridge, with plot lines including alcoholism, gambling, and dementia, until Spencer\u2019s retirement in 2022 at the age of 103.",
      "At the time, her colleagues paid tribute to an actor who never fluffed a line.",
      "\u201cI have rarely worked with such an inventive, focused and technically brilliant actor,\u201d said Jeremy Howe \u2013 the editor of the programme, \"or with such a lovely person\".",
      "The Archers radio star June Spencer dies aged 105",
      "June Rosalind Spencer was born on 14 June 1919, just six months after the end of World War One.",
      "Her acting career began at the age of three, when she was cast as King of the Land of Nod in a school play. When she heard the audience laugh, June knew it was the life for her.",
      "She went to Nottingham High School for Girls, which she found \u201cvery stark, grey and cold\u201d.",
      "She was forced to give up sport \u2013 her favourite lesson \u2013 when a doctor somehow misdiagnosed a heart condition.",
      "An only child, her father was a \u201csensible and supportive\u201d biscuit salesman, but her mother was another story.",
      "A \u201ccomplex woman\u201d, Mrs Spencer had once aspired to the stage herself, but \u2013 according to her daughter - \u201cjust gave up on life... and decided she was an invalid at the age of 40\u201d.",
      "June Spencer had little choice but to leave school to look after her mother \u2013 who eventually lived until she was 94.",
      "Miserably, mother and daughter sat together in a darkened room in case Mrs Spencer had \"an attack\".",
      "Her headmistress was angry, complaining that her former pupil was throwing her life away. \u201cI was frightened of her,\u201d June later recalled.",
      "\u201cShe told me, \u2018Of course, you can't expect to get anywhere without your School Certificate\u2019.",
      "\"I have thought of those words many times since, particularly when I received my OBE.\u201d",
      "In her teens, the aspiring actress enjoyed writing comic monologues - performing them as part of the after-dinner entertainment at local Masonic lodges.",
      "But with her heart set on the stage, her mother was obstructive: refusing to let her daughter sit the exams for the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.",
      "\u201cI think my mother thought I would fall in with a bad lot,\u201d Spencer said. \"When I did finally get in [to the theatre] she said: 'Oh well, I suppose it was inevitable'.\"",
      "She joined a drama club, studied for a London Guildhall drama school certificate, and finally joined a local theatre company in 1942.",
      "The same year she married a \u201cfair-haired, blue-eyed boy with the cheekiest grin I\u2019d ever seen\u201d.",
      "She had first met Roger Brocksom when she was 17 years old, on holiday near Skegness \u2013 but he didn\u2019t have the money to buy her a ring.",
      "The wedding took place while he was on leave from the army; wartime shortages meant they had rice paper rather than icing on the cake.",
      "A series of small parts on BBC radio programmes followed, and \u2013 by the time her husband returned from the war \u2013 Spencer was finding regular work.",
      "Then came the moment that changed her life.",
      "The founder of The Archers, Godfrey Baseley, is said to have talked openly in meetings about who was going to be in his new programme \u2013 and news travelled fast.",
      "It reached a mystified June Spencer while she was getting lunch in the BBC canteen.",
      "\u201cA girl said to me, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be in The Archers, aren\u2019t you?\u2019\" she recalled. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Am I? What\u2019s The Archers?\u2019\u201d",
      "In 1950, there were a few pilot episodes and then the big launch on New Year\u2019s Day, 1951 \u2013 with June Spencer playing a heavily pregnant Peggy Archer.",
      "The series hoped to be a public service for farmers, with gentle storylines that brought urban listeners into rural surroundings \u2013 almost as if they were eavesdropping on farmers and their wives.",
      "To start with, Spencer had a 13-week contract and little idea that she was helping to create a unique slice of British life.",
      "The shows were then broadcast live, with producers creeping in and scribbling alterations on scripts, moments before she read them.",
      "But The Archers was an instant hit with the actors \u2013 despite never having their credits read out on air \u2013 in demand for local appearances.",
      "\"I remember going down to a gathering of all the Women's Institutes in Cornwall,\u201d June recalled, \u201cand I was mobbed. It was quite frightening.\"",
      "There was a brief break from the show when June and Roger adopted two children in the late 1950s. Thelma Rogers took over the part for a while, but soon returned to the theatre.",
      "On taking back the role, Spencer insisted she had little in common with Peggy, who rather lacked a sense of humour, but her on-air journey from young barmaid to grieving widow saw them both involved in some of the show's strongest storylines.",
      "Peggy\u2019s first husband, Jack Archer, succumbed to alcoholism, while her second husband Jack Woolley \u2013 with whom she hoped to enjoy a happy retirement - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's.",
      "The show\u2019s slow-moving plot lines meant each disease unfolded over years - as they do in real life. And both issues were close to June\u2019s heart.",
      "Around the time of her Golden Wedding anniversary, Spencer had noticed that Roger\u2019s memory \u201cwas playing him false\u201d and \u201cthen the repetitive questions started,\u201d she said.",
      "When Peggy Woolley\u2019s husband was given the same disease in The Archers, June was supportive and \u2013 with her experience of Roger\u2019s gradual disintegration \u2013 was often consulted by the scriptwriters.",
      "Roger passed away in 2001. Five years later, June saw her son David \u2013 a ballet dancer who had lost his career through injury - die of alcohol abuse. He was 55 years old.",
      "For Spencer, such things were not unusual occurrences of life imitating art. Her attitude was that every family experiences traumas and disasters, and drama helps them to deal with it.",
      "\u201cWe tackle difficult situations that come up in real life, and treat them without being sensational,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think people appreciate that. When they have the same sort of problems, they hear how the Archers coped, and I think it helps them.\"",
      "June Spencer was made an OBE in 1991 and a CBE in Queen Elizabeth\u2019s Birthday Honours List in 2017.",
      "Interviewers who came to her home in rural Surrey were routinely charmed.",

      "He documented much of his trip on Snapchat, including pictures of food, plans to play polo, and jokes about his hair.",
      "We also know the pop star visited a friend's house in Argentina in the days before he died, again with Cassidy.",
      "But when Payne fell to his death, Cassidy had already left the country.",
      "What happened on the day he died?",
      "Payne had been staying in the upmarket Casa Sur hotel for three days before his death.",
      "A call was made to emergency services around 17:00 local time (21:00 BST) on 16 October by staff, with requests to respond to a hotel guest \"who is overwhelmed by drugs and alcohol\" and \"destroying his room\".",
      "\"I don't know if the guest's life is in danger. But he has a room with a balcony and we're a little afraid that he might do something life-threatening,\" said the hotel's front desk manager in a second call.",

      "Payne's room was on the third floor and had a balcony about 14m (45ft) above an interior courtyard.",

      "They also ruled out self-harm or physical intervention by a third party.",

      "When the musician suffered a brain aneurysm in 1974, his chances of survival were said to be so slim, and his stature so high, that his famous friends started planning a tribute concert.",
      "Then aged 41, Jones had already made an indelible mark on American music as a performer, arranger, songwriter, producer, soundtrack composer and record executive.",
      "He started out in the jumping jazz clubs of the 1950s; mastered soul, swing and pop on recordings by Dinah Washington, Frank Sinatra and Lesley Gore; and reached the top 10 in his own right.",
      "Some of the biggest entertainers in America agreed to perform at his memorial.",
      "When he pulled through, the show went ahead anyway.",
      "Jones went along, accompanied by his neurologist, who gave strict instructions not to get too excited.",
      "\"That was hard to do with Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan and Sidney Poitier singing your praises,\" he told Newsweek in 2008.",
      "Even more exciting things were yet to come.",
      "Jones went on to forge an era-defining partnership with Michael Jackson; oversee 1985's We Are the World, one of the biggest-selling songs of all time; craft hits for acts like Chaka Khan and Donna Summer; and work with the biggest names in hip-hop.",
      "Few branches of American popular music were immune to his influence.",
      "Jones had always been a survivor.",
      "He grew up in the shadow of the Great Depression in the 1930s on the South Side of Chicago. His mother was taken to a psychiatric institution when he was seven and his father worked as a carpenter for notorious gangsters the Jones Boys.",
      "Young Quincy wanted to be a gangster too. \"You want to be what you see, and that's all we ever saw,\" he said.",
      "He and his brother were \"street rats\" and, when he strayed into the wrong neighbourhood at the age of seven, a rival gang member \"nailed my hand to a fence\". Another injury came from an ice pick to the face.",
      "His father took the family to Washington state, where one night Quincy and some friends broke into a community centre, looking for food. Inside, there was a piano.",
      "\"I touched it and every cell in my body said, this is what you'll do [for] the rest of your life,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Front Row in 2016.",
      "The encounter \"changed my life\", he said in conversation with rapper Kendrick Lamar for a 2018 Netflix documentary, adding that, \"I would have been dead or in prison a long time ago\" if he hadn't discovered music.",
      "Quincy immediately began experimenting with instruments at school, settling on the trumpet, and began playing in nightclubs.",
      "At the age of 14, he made friends with another then-unknown musician called Ray Charles, who became a lifelong collaborator.",
      "He also played with Billie Holiday at 14, and got taken under the wings of bandleader Count Basie and trumpeter Clark Terry. He went on to accompany Dizzy Gillespie and appeared in the band during Elvis Presley's first TV appearance.",
      "After showing a talent for arranging songs while touring the world with Lionel Hampton's big band, he was soon in demand in that capacity, too.",
      "But after running up a $145,000 debt on a European tour, he took a day job with Mercury Records in 1961, becoming the first African-American vice-president of a major record label.",
      "While there, he discovered and produced the million-selling single It's My Party by Lesley Gore. He also released the Big Band Bossa Nova compilation album, which included his own infectious track Soul Bossa Nova, which has since become a staple of parties and film soundtracks, including Austin Powers.",
      "Meanwhile, Sinatra had been impressed with Jones's work and called on him to arrange and conduct two of his albums in the 1960s. The pair formed a fertile partnership, with Sinatra calling him \"a giant\" and \"one of the finest musicians I've ever known\".",
      "The pair became firm friends outside the studio, too. \"Seven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying,\" Jones recalled.",
      "Jones also worked with many other big names of the age, including Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong and Sammy Davis Jr, while his solo album Body Heat reached the US top 10.",
      "Quincy Jones: His brilliance explained in 10 songs",
      "Quincy Jones, giant of US music, has died aged 91",
      "Meanwhile, he was forging a career writing soundtracks for TV shows and films including In Cold Blood, The Italian Job and Roots.",
      "In Cold Blood's author Truman Capote reportedly tried to have Jones removed from the film because he was black. But he remained, and the score earned Jones the first of seven Oscar nominations.",
      "Another soundtrack was The Wiz, the 1978 film musical version of the Wizard of Oz, which starred Diana Ross and a 19-year-old Michael Jackson, who was looking to branch out after finding childhood fame in The Jackson 5.",
      "Jones saw a superstar quality in Jackson and became his producer and mentor, first on 1979's Off the Wall, which was a major hit, and then 1982's Thriller, which reached new heights of commercial and critical success, and made Jackson the undisputed King of Pop.",
      "The album was not just the fulfilment of Jackson's talent, but the culmination of Jones's career, as he used his peerless musical expertise to define the 1980s with a sleek and polished fusion of R&B and pop.",
      "Jones listened to hundreds of songs to decide which nine should go on the album, and employed a dream team of musicians and songwriters that he had been assembling over the years.",
      "His choice of collaborators was one example of his knack for knowing how to make a good song great. For Beat It, he thought the single needed a rockier edge, so he recruited Eddie Van Halen to contribute a guitar solo. Legend has it that the solo was so explosive that a speaker caught fire in the studio.",
      "And when it came to the title track, Jones didn't like the original name Starlight, so he asked its writer, Rod Temperton, to come up with something different. Temperton renamed it Thriller and recast it with a spooky theme. Jones topped it off by asking his wife's friend, horror actor Vincent Price, to record a spoken-word outro.",
      "The album earned Jones and Jackson the Grammy Award for producer of the year, while Thriller was named album of the year and Beat It won record of the year.",
      "Jones used his winning formula in the 1980s with George Benson, Donna Summer and Patti Austin, and produced the decade's best-selling single when Jackson and Lionel Richie assembled 35 of America's biggest names for the 1985 charity song We Are the World.",
      "Jones famously posted a message on the studio entrance telling the stars: \"Check your egos at the door\".",
      "He had further success under his own name with his albums The Dude and Back on the Block. The latter, released in 1989, featured an all-star cast including many friends from his early career like Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie and Ray Charles.",
      "But as well as revisiting his past, he was also firmly in the present, enlisting rappers like Ice-T and Grandmaster Melle Mel to appear on the title track.",
      "It earned Jones another album of the year award at the Grammys.",
      "Although he was in his 50s, he embraced rap music because he saw similarities with the energy of bebop jazz, and because may of its stars had risen out of hardship on the streets.",
      "\"I feel a kinship there because we went through a lot of the same stuff,\" he said.",
      "And rap stars reciprocated his affection, looking on Jones as an inspirational elder statesman of black American music. Even Kendrick and Dr Dre were awestruck when meeting him for the Netflix documentary, which was titled Quincy and directed by his daughter, actress Rashida Jones.",
      "Jones used his status to try to stem the violence in the hip-hop world, convening the Quincy Jones Hip-Hop Symposium in 1995, where he addressed a room full of the nation's rap stars.",
      "\"I want to see you guys live at least to my age,\" he told them.",
      "For Jones, social activism went hand-in-hand with his music.",
      "He met Martin Luther King in 1955, and \"from then on, my life was never the same\", he said.",
      "\"Civil rights work and political involvement was no longer an activity to do on the side. It became an essential part of life and humanity.\"",
      "He set up the Quincy Jones Listen Up Foundation and launched the We Are the Future project, among support for other causes.",
      "Elsewhere, his redoubtable work ethic saw him launch a record label and hip-hop magazine Vibe, as well as producing films like The Color Purple and TV shows including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.",
      "With that workload, and an accompanying longstanding drink problem, his family life and his health both suffered.",
      "He married and divorced three times, having a nervous breakdown after splitting from third wife Peggy Lipton. To recover, he went to stay on the Pacific island owned by actor Marlon Brando, whom he first met in a jazz club at the age of 18.",
      "Jones was also in a relationship with actress and model Nastassja Kinski in the 1990s, and he had seven children in total.",
      "In 2015, he went into a diabetic coma for four days, and the following year went to hospital with a blood clot.",
      "His death on Sunday at the age of 91 has left the music world in mourning.",
      "If there's to be a second Quincy Jones memorial concert, stars will be queuing up to celebrate the full achievements of a singular talent."

      "Here are 10 songs that showcase his versatility and brilliance in the studio, and his ability to draw the best out of the musicians he worked with.",
      "1) Michael Jackson - Billie Jean",
      "Michael Jackson met Quincy Jones on the set of the 1978 movie The Wiz, and asked him to produce his next album. That record was Off The Wall - a disco extravaganza that established Jackson as a solo star.",
      "They teamed up again for 1982's Thriller, which arguably remade the pop business. Not only did it produce seven top 10 singles; but it crossed racial barriers, appealing equally to black and white audiences.",
      "Key to the success was Billie Jean, a dark tale about the groupies Jackson met while touring with his brothers. As a producer, Jones wasn't keen on the track at first - arguing with Jackson about the long instrumental opening.",
      "\"I said, \u2018Michael we\u2019ve got to cut that intro,\u2019\u201d he later recalled.",
      "\"He said, \u2018But that\u2019s the jelly! That\u2019s what makes me want to dance.' And when Michael Jackson tells you, 'That\u2019s what makes me want to dance,' well, the rest of us just have to shut up.\"",
      "With those words ringing in his ears, Jones kept the arrangement lean and funky. He even instructed sound engineer Bruce Swedien to create a drum sound with a \"sonic personality\" that no-one had ever heard before. The result is one of the most recognisable intros in the history of pop.",

      "\u201cSeven double Jack Daniels in an hour... [Sinatra] invented partying.\"",
      "After establishing their relationship on 1964's It Might As Well Be Swing, Jones helped Sinatra re-arrange his signature songs for a four-week residency at the Copa Room in The Sands hotel, Las Vegas.",
      "\"It was probably the most exciting engagement I have ever done in my life, since I started performing,\" Sinatra later recalled.",
      "Accompanied by the Count Basie Orchestra, the star sounds perfectly at ease, breezing around standards like I've Got You Under My Skin, Fly Me To The Moon and You Make Me Feel So Young.",
      "But it's Come Fly With Me that most perfectly captures the vitality of Jones's new arrangements, especially in the charismatic interplay between Sinatra and the brass section.",
      "No wonder that it was chosen as the show's opening number - as captured on the award-winning live album, Sinatra At The Sands.",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "Listen to Come Fly With Me (Live)",
      "3) Lesley Gore - It's My Party",
      "Lesley Gore was just a teenager when her vocal demos made their way into Quincy Jones's hands in the early 1960s. Up to that point, he'd been working with jazz singers like Sinatra and Sarah Vaughan - but he heard something he liked on Gore's tape.",
      "\"She had a mellow, distinctive voice and sang in tune, which a lot of grown up rock \u2018n\u2019 roll singers couldn\u2019t do, so I signed her,\u201d he wrote in his autobiography.",
      "For their first session, Jones picked It's My Party out of a pile of 200 demos and got to work. He double-tracked Gore's voice, adding little flourishes of brass and unexpected chord changes that perfectly evoke the song's adolescent angst.",
      "He then rush-released the single, after discovering that Phil Spector had plans to record the same song with the Crystals. It duly topped the US charts and went to number nine in the UK.",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "Listen to It's My Party",
      "4) Quincy Jones - Summer In The City",
      "Recorded by The Lovin' Spoonful, Summer In The City is a 1960s rock classic, full of ominous organ chords and powerful drum hits that capture the sticky filth of an oppressive heatwave.",
      "Quincy Jones version, recorded for his 1973 album You've Got It Bad Girl, is almost unrecognisable as the same song. Lazily chilled-out, the Hammond organ is played with a featherlight touch, and the drums are gently brushed.",
      "Most of the lyrics are excised and, when they arrive at the 2'30\" mark, they're sung with almost heavenly serenity by Valerie Simpson (of Ashford and Simpson fame).",
      "Originally released as a b-side, it's become one of Jones's most influential songs. According to WhoSampled.com, it's been sampled on 87 other songs, including tracks by Massive Attack, Eminem, Nightmares on Wax and The Roots.",

      "Listen to Summer In The City",
      "5) Dinah Washington - Mad About The Boy",
      "Another example of how Jones's skill as an arranger could completely change a song.",
      "Mad About The Boy was written by Sir No\u00ebl Coward, for the 1932 revue Words and Music. In the original, it was sung by four different women, each expressing their love for an unnamed film star (rumoured to be Douglas Fairbanks Jr) as they wait in line to see one of his films.",
      "It's funny and quirky and clever - but when Dinah Washington covered the song in 1961, Jones slowed it down and switched the time signature from 4/4 to 6/8, allowing the singer to prowl through the lyrics with a newfound carnality.",
      "Overlooked at the time, it gained a new lease of life in 1992 when it was used to soundtrack a Levis advert and crept into the UK charts for the first time.",

      "6) Quincy Jones - Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Written in just 20 minutes, Soul Bossa Nova was inspired by an early-60s fad for Brazilian music, sparked by the success of Jo\u00e3o Gilberto and Stan Getz's Desafinado.",
      "Jones is in his element here - with chirruping flutes and big trombone slides that capture the joie de vivre of the carnival. He also makes prominent use of a cu\u00edca, the Brazilian drum that produces what sounds like a very happy monkey in the opening bars.",
      "The bossa craze may have been short-lived, but Jones's song endured, most memorably in the opening dance sequence of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery.",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "Listen to Soul Bossa Nova",
      "7) Michael Jackson - Beat It",
      "From the beginning, Jones and Jackson planned to make Thriller a blockbuster pop album.",
      "\"We went through 800 songs to get to nine,\" Jones said. \"That's not casual.\"",
      "The work was exhausting. At one point, they were working in three studios simultaneously... until the speakers caught fire.",
      "Beat It was crucial to the project - because it was designed to get Jackson played on US rock radio, an unheard of prospect in the heavily segregated music industry of the 1980s.",
      "Jones had told Jackson to write \"a black version\" of The Knack's My Sharona - the 1979 hit song that sold more then 10 million copies. But Jackson was one step ahead. He had a demo that fitted the bill, albeit without a hook or lyrics.",
      "While Jackson worked on those elements (you can hear his first, wordless attempt at the melody on his YouTube channel), Jones called on Eddie Van Halen to perform the guitar solo.",
      "\"He came in and he stacked up his Gibson [guitars],\" Jones later recalled.",
      "\"I said, 'I'm not going to sit here and try to tell you what to play... Let's try three or four takes. Some of it will be over-animated, some of it will be long, and we'll sculpt it.",
      "\"And he played his ass off.\"",
      "The song, with its West Side Story-inspired video, landed just as MTV took off, making Jackson a permanent fixture in living rooms across America.",
      "But for all the commercial focus of the Thriller project, Jones always maintained that the music came first.",
      "\"I've never, ever in my life done music for money or fame - because that's when God walks out of the room,\" he said.",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "Listen to Beat It",
      "8) The Brothers Johnson - Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Jones discovered guitarist George Johnson and bassist Louis Johnson when he heard them playing on a demo by Chaka Khan's sister, Taka Boom.",
      "He hired them to play on the soundtrack for the celebrated TV mini-series Roots, placed them in his touring band, and helmed their 1976 debut album Look Out For #1 (including a sublime cover of The Beatles' Come Together).",
      "But the brothers didn't achieve mainstream success until 1977, with the release of Strawberry Letter #23.",
      "Originally recorded by Shuggie Otis, Jones's version toughens up the production, with a strutting bassline and soaring backing vocals - but George Johnson struggled to recreate Shuggie's original guitar solo, which was full of complicated triplet notes.",
      "Frustrated, Jones called up session musician Lee Ritenour for help.",
      "\"Quincy was walking down the hallway tearing his hair out,\" Ritenour later recalled. \"He said, 'I'm going to lunch, Ritenour. Get it done.'",
      "Released in the middle of the punk and disco boom, the song's romantic psychedelia still found an audience - reaching number 13 in the charts. It was later re-popularised by Quentin Tarantino in the film Jackie Brown.",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "Listen to Strawberry Letter #23",
      "9) Sarah Vaughan - Misty",
      "Early in his career, Jones was one of the most in-demand arrangers in jazz, working with the likes of Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald and Peggy Lee.",
      "In 1958, he recorded an entire album with Sarah Vaughan in Paris, backed by a 55-piece orchestra. Among the highlights is the lovestruck ballad Misty - originally recorded by pianist Erroll Garner, and made famous by Johnny Mathis.",
      "Unlike their syrupy and sentimental versions, Vaughan and Jones (along with producer Jack Tracy) give the lyrics some pathos. She might be \"as helpless as a kitten up a tree\", but you're never entirely convinced she's happy about the situation.",
      "Jones adds beguiling touches - from the cascading strings when Vaughan sings \"a thousand violins begin to play\", to the beautifully muted saxophone line, played by Zoot Sims.",
      "Vaughan died of lung cancer in 1990. In 2019, on what would have been her 95th birthday, Jones posted a tribute to the singer, using his pet name for her - Sassy.",
      "\"Dear sweet Sassy was all about sophistication and chord changes and, man, I\u2019m telling you she thought like a horn and SANG like a horn!\" he wrote on Facebook..",
      "\"We had quite the journey together, & I will never forget each moment we had, because every moment was a special one.\"",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "Listen to Misty",
      "10) USA For Africa - We Are The World",
      "\"Check your egos at the door,\" said the hand-written sign that Quincy Jones pinned to the door of his recording studio in 1985.",
      "The occasion was the recording of We Are The World - a star-studded charity single that aimed to raise money for famine relief in Ethiopia.",
      "Written by Lionel Richie and Michael Jackson, the record featured vocals from Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Cyndi Lauper, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick and Bob Dylan, all recorded in a single night.",
      "Herding the singers was a massive headache, as the recent Netflix documentary The Greatest Night In Pop revealed.",
      "At one point, Stevie Wonder insisted that some of the lyrics should be rewritten in Swahili - despite the fact that the people of Ethiopia, who would be the main beneficiaries of the famine-relief fundraiser, largely speak other languages.",
      "Jones oversaw the whole session with the patience and wisdom of a producer who'd seen it all.",
      "The results aren't particularly great - the song is sickly and overlong - but the fact that it's coherent at all is a testament to his skill as a producer, arranger, mentor and referee.",
      "In the end, the song raised more than $63m ($227m or \u00a3178m adjusted for inflation); and Jones looked back on it as one of his proudest achievements.",
      "\u201cI have never before or since experienced the joy I felt that night working with this rich, complex human tapestry of love, talent, and grace,\" he wrote in his 2002 autobiography.",

      "In January, Thea asked Archie about payment for her work on Netflix\u2019s The Crown and a car advert.",

      "In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing \"safety standards\" on social media platforms.",
      "The group also pointed to UN advice that \"national policies\" designed to regulate online spaces \"should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it\".",
      "But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content,  misinformation, bullying and other social pressures.",
      "A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are \"not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely\" until at least 16, and that currently \"excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness\".",
      "When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it \"assumes an equal power relationship\".",

    "story": [
      "UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy is coming to the end of his maiden tour of Africa with the aim of resetting relations with the 54-nation continent.",
      "\"Our new approach will deliver respectful partnerships that listen rather than tell, deliver long-term growth rather than short-term solutions and build a freer, safer, more prosperous continent,\" he said as he set out the agenda for his trip to the continent's two biggest powers - Nigeria and South Africa.",
      "Lammy's visit follows his appointment as foreign secretary in the Labour government that took office earlier this year.",
      "Since Labour was last in office in 2010, relations between African states and other world powers have changed massively.",
      "Today, China is the largest trade partner for many African countries, while Russia has increasingly made inroads, including by offering military support to West African states battling jihadists.",
      "Oil-rich Gulf nations, along with Turkey,  have also been increasing their influence on the continent by striking business and military deals.",
      "In contrast, UK-Africa relations have been \"a lot more lacklustre\", says Alex Vines, the head of the Africa programme at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "This is particularly the case between the UK and its  biggest trading partner on the continent, South Africa, and the trip is an \"attempt to reboot that\", he adds.",
      "\"I want to hear what our African partners need and foster relationships so that the UK and our friends and partners in Africa can grow together,\" Lammy said.",
      "Britain is no newcomer to the continent. A long \u2013 and at times chequered \u2013 history underpins many of its relationships with African countries.",
      "Almost all its former colonies on the continent are part of the Commonwealth, although countries that did not have this historical link to the UK have joined the group, including Rwanda, Togo and Gabon. Angola has also applied to join.",
      "\"The Commonwealth will likely continue to be a key platform,\" says Nicole Beardsworth, an academic at South Africa's Wits University.",
      "As its former colonies gained independence in the middle of the last century, Britain continued to play a sort of \"big brother\" role.",
      "But this is now changing.",
      "Dr Vines says Africa did not feature significantly in a major document released last year to outline the UK's priorities on the global stage.",
      "\"There were name checks to countries like Nigeria and South Africa and Kenya in it, but there wasn't much written,\" he says.",
      "Dr Vines adds that he expects South Africa-UK relations to improve under Labour because of its historic ties with the anti-apartheid movement that fought white-minority rule.",
      "\"That comes from the anti-apartheid struggle and the solidarity that Labour and people that were the Labour movement provided for combating apartheid,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth, however, notes that former Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May tried to bolster ties with Africa, but her efforts were \"scuppered\" after she resigned in 2019 following turmoil in the then governing party.",
      "The UK then had an unprecedented turnover of prime ministers who had to deal with domestic crises, the UK's withdrawal from the European Union, and the Covid pandemic.",
      "\"Africa fell off the radar,\" Dr Beardsworth says, adding that the exception was the controversial, and now-scrapped, deal to send some asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda.",
      "Being the world\u2019s youngest continent \u2013 with a median age of 19 \u2013 Africa presents opportunities for the future, the UK Foreign Office said.",

      "The UK Foreign Office said that \"growth is the core mission of this government and will underpin our relationships in Nigeria, South Africa and beyond\".",
      "That will mean \"more jobs and more opportunities for Brits and Africans alike,\" it added.",
      "The UK's Africa policy has long focused on development aid, but this has been slashed in recent years as the country faces its own economic crisis.",
      "Dr Vines says aid can be important to deal with humanitarian crises, climate shocks and to finance projects aimed at expanding the private sector in Africa, but he does not see the Labour government increasing funding.",
      "\"When you had a previous Labour government under Tony Blair, Britain saw itself as a global superpower for international development - that\u2019s no longer the case,\" he says.",
      "Dr Beardsworth says relations are expected to move towards being more economically focused, and \"much more mutually beneficial\".",
      "She says this could also see the normalisation of the UK's relations with Zimbabwe and Harare being welcomed back to the Commonwealth after relations broke down during the rule of the late Robert Mugabe.",
      "Differences over international affairs such as the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East could also play out less in the public.",
      "South Africa\u2019s position on both conflicts has been at odds with much of the West.",

      "\"Two things can exist at the same time - I can still hold my position, I can still hold my views, and we can still have a mutually beneficial relationship without the moral pressure of you saying that I have to agree with everything that you say,\" she adds.",
      "Dr Vines agrees, saying he expects the UK to continue promoting multi-party democracy in Africa, but there will be \"less finger-wagging, and more quiet diplomacy\".",

    "summary": "Britain's oldest satellite is in the wrong part of the sky, but no-one's really sure who moved it.",
    "story": [
      "Someone moved the UK's oldest satellite and there appears to be no record of exactly who, when or why.",
      "Launched in 1969, just a few months after humans first set foot on the Moon, Skynet-1A was put high above Africa's east coast to relay communications for British forces.",
      "When the spacecraft ceased working a few years later, gravity might have been expected to pull it even further to the east, out over the Indian Ocean.",
      "But today, curiously, Skynet-1A is actually half a planet away, in a position 22,369 miles (36,000km) above the Americas.",
      "Orbital mechanics mean it's unlikely the half-tonne military spacecraft simply drifted to its current location.",
      "Almost certainly, it was commanded to fire its thrusters in the mid-1970s to take it westwards. The question is who that was and with what authority and purpose?",
      "It's intriguing that key information about a once vital national security asset can just evaporate. But, fascination aside, you might also reasonably ask why it still matters. After all, we're talking about some discarded space junk from 50 years ago.",
      "\"It's still relevant because whoever did move Skynet-1A did us few favours,\" says space consultant Dr Stuart Eves.",
      "\"It's now in what we call a 'gravity well' at 105 degrees West longitude, wandering backwards and forwards like a marble at the bottom of a bowl. And unfortunately this brings it close to other satellite traffic on a regular basis.",
      "\"Because it's dead, the risk is it might bump into something, and because it's 'our' satellite we're still responsible for it,\" he explains.",
      "Dr Eves has looked through old satellite catalogues, the National Archives and spoken to satellite experts worldwide, but he can find no clues to the end-of-life behaviour of Britain's oldest spacecraft.",
      "It might be tempting to reach for a conspiracy theory or two, not least because it's hard to hear the name \"Skynet\" without thinking of the malevolent, self-aware artificial intelligence (AI) system in The Terminator movie franchise.",
      "But there's no connection other than the name and, in any case, real life is always more prosaic.",

      "How do we solve the problem of space debris?",
      "What we do know is that Skynet-1A was manufactured in the US by the now defunct Philco Ford aerospace company and put in space by a US Air Force Delta rocket.",
      "\"The first Skynet satellite revolutionised UK telecommunications capacity, permitting London to securely communicate with British forces as far away as Singapore. However, from a technological standpoint, Skynet-1A was more American than British since the United States both built and launched it,\" remarked Dr Aaron Bateman in a recent paper on the history of the Skynet programme, which is now on its fifth generation.",
      "This view is confirmed by Graham Davison who flew Skynet-1A in the early 70s from its UK operations centre at RAF Oakhanger in Hampshire.",
      "\"The Americans originally controlled the satellite in orbit. They tested all of our software against theirs, before then eventually handing over control to the RAF,\" the long-retired engineer told me.",
      "\"In essence, there was dual control, but when or why Skynet-1A might have been handed back to the Americans, which seems likely - I'm afraid I can't remember,\" says Mr Davison, who is now in his 80s.",
      "Rachel Hill, a PhD student from University College London, has also been scouring the National Archives.",
      "Her readings have led her to one very reasonable possibility.",
      "\"A Skynet team from Oakhanger would go to the USAF satellite facility in Sunnyvale (colloquially known as the Blue Cube) and operate Skynet during 'Oakout'. This was when control was temporarily transferred to the US while Oakhanger was down for essential maintenance. Perhaps the move could have happened then?\u201d Ms Hill speculated.",
      "The official, though incomplete, logs of Skynet-1A\u2019s status suggest final commanding was left in the hands of the Americans when Oakhanger lost sight of the satellite in June 1977.",
      "But however Skynet-1A then got shifted to its present position, it was ultimately allowed to die in an awkward place when really it should have been put in an \"orbital graveyard\".",
      "This refers to a region even higher in the sky where old space junk runs zero risk of running into active telecommunications satellites.",
      "Graveyarding is now standard practice, but back in the 1970s no-one gave much thought to space sustainability.",
      "Attitudes have since changed because the space domain is getting congested.",
      "At 105 degrees West longitude, an active satellite might see a piece of junk come within 50km of its position up to four times a day.",
      "That might sound like they\u2019re nowhere near each other, but at the velocities these defunct objects move it\u2019s starting to get a little too close for comfort.",
      "The Ministry of Defence said Skynet-1A was constantly monitored by the UK's National Space Operations Centre. Other satellite operators are informed if there's likely to be a particularly close conjunction, in case they need to take evasive action.",
      "Ultimately, though, the British government may have to think about removing the old satellite to a safer location.",
      "Technologies are being developed to grab junk left in space.",
      "Already, the UK Space Agency is funding efforts to do this at lower altitudes, and the Americans and the Chinese have shown it's possible to snare ageing hardware even in the kind of high orbit occupied by Skynet-1A.",

      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",

      "These high temperatures are mainly down to human-caused climate change, with smaller contributions from natural factors such as the El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern.",
      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",
      "A simple guide to climate change",
      "How is climate change linked to extreme weather?",
      "What is El Ni\u00f1o and how does it change the weather?",
      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",
      "Many scientists expect the opposite, cooler phase, La Ni\u00f1a, to develop soon. This should, in theory, lead to a temporary drop in global temperatures next year, although exactly how this will play out is uncertain.",
      "\"We will watch with interest what happens going into 2025 and beyond,\" says Ed Hawkins, professor of climate science at the University of Reading.",
      "But, with levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere still rising quickly, scientists warn it is likely only a matter of time before new records are set.",
      "\"The warmer temperatures [are making] storms more intense, heatwaves hotter and heavy rainfall more extreme, with clearly seen consequences for people all around the world,\" says Prof Hawkins.",
      "\"Stabilising global temperatures by reaching net zero emissions is the only way to stop adding to the costs of these disasters.\"",

      "While climate change did not play much of a role in this year's campaign, Trump's likely actions in office this time could be far more significant than in 2017.",
      "Back then, he announced the US would pull out of the Paris climate agreement, the most important UN process to tackle climate change.  The agreement saw almost all the world's nations - for the first time - agree to cut the greenhouse gas emissions which cause global warming.",
      "But the shock of Trump's decision was limited. The treaty's rules meant the US was not able to withdraw until November 2020, a few months before he left office.",
      "If Trump withdraws again, he will only have to wait a year before the US is completely out. That would give him three years to chart his own course without any need to report to the UN or be bound by its rules.",
      "While President Joe Biden's negotiators will be at next week's COP talks in Azerbaijan, nothing they agree to will be binding for the Trump administration.",
      "\"The US at this COP is not just a lame duck, it's a dead duck,\" said Prof Richard Klein, an expert on climate change policy for the Stockholm Environment Institute.",
      "\"They can't commit to anything and that means that countries like China will not want to commit to anything.\"",
      "In recent years, richer countries such as the US, UK and EU states have tried to increase the funds available for developing countries to cope with climate change. But they also insist that big developing economies also contribute.",
      "\"The US basically wanted to have China cough up some money for that fund as well. Now they won't be able to do that. That leaves China off the hook,\" Prof Klein said.",
      "Climate scientists say developing countries need billions of dollars of extra investment to become net zero, where they are not contributing to climate change, and stave off the effects of rising temperatures.",
      "While the US might leave the Paris Agreement quite quickly, Trump would still be bound by other global efforts to fight climate change.",
      "There have been reports that some of his supporters also want to turn their backs on these as well. Some have argued for a complete break from UN efforts on climate change, urging the president-elect to leave something called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the treaty that underpins global collective action to tackle climate change.",

      "As well as these headline-grabbing international actions, the new Trump administration is likely to push for a major ramp up of oil and gas exploration within the US, roll back environmental protections as well as impose heavy tariffs on electric vehicles and solar panels coming from China.",

      "Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, which may ultimately channel $1 trillion of spending into green energy, has been hugely beneficial to Republican districts.",

      "The regulator says a merger between Vodafone and Three could go ahead - if both companies make price promises for consumers and commit to boosting the UK's 5G rollout.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) had previously said that creating what would be the country's biggest mobile network could drive up prices and harm competition.",
      "But it has now provisionally concluded those concerns could be addressed - and the merger could proceed - if the firms agree to its proposed remedies.",
      "A Vodafone spokesperson said both companies would need to study the CMA's proposal more closely but believed on first impressions it \"provides a path to final clearance\".",

      "\"We believe this deal has the potential to be pro-competitive for the UK mobile sector if our concerns are addressed,\" said Stuart McIntosh, who is leading the CMA panel investigating the merger.",
      "\"We anticipate in the longer term that the significant commitment to upgrade the merged companies network over the next 10 years or so will ultimately create a competitive environment that will maintain the competition we've seen in mobile in recent years,\" he told the Today programme, on BBC Radio Four.",
      "But he also made clear that short term commitments not to increase the price of certain existing mobile tariffs and data plans for at least three years were also key to making sure consumers did not lose out.",

      "The two largest players in the market are currently EE and 02 - Mr Pescatore said a merged Vodafone and Three would be in a better place to take them on.",
      "\"To date, both parties are demonstrating that this is genuinely in the interest of UK plc, the economy, and users which paves the way for a far stronger three-player market than the current imbalance,\" he said.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re the Wall Street of the data centre industry,\u201d says Ms Bolthouse, who is a director of local Virginian charity and campaign group Piedmont Environmental Council.",
      "Data centres are vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Northern Virginia, the northern region of the state of Virginia, has been a key location for data centres since the 1990s. This is thanks to its immediate proximity to Washington DC, yet with historically cheap electricity and land prices.",
      "Centred on the city of Ashburn, which is 35 miles (56km) west of the US capital, there are more than 477 data centres in the state. This is by far the largest number in the US, with Texas in second place on 290, and California third with 283.",
      "In fact, some studies say that 70% of the world\u2019s internet traffic goes through Ashburn and the surrounding area, which has been dubbed \u201cData Centre Alley\u201d.",
      "Thanks in large part to the continuing boom in artificial intelligence (AI), which requires more computing power, demand for data centres is rocketing. As a result, global data centre capacity is expected to double over the next five years, according to a recent study by business analysis firm Moody\u2019s.",
      "Ms Bolthouse and other environmentalists in Northern Virginia are opposed to the continuing expansion of the data centre sector in their region, saying it is already having a major negative impact on their quality of life.",
      "She points to new electricity cables being built over conservation land, parks and neighbourhoods, increased water demand, and the facilities\u2019 back-up diesel generators affecting air quality.",
      "Ms Bolthouse also cites the fact that households in Virginia and neighbouring Maryland are being expected to help pay for the electricity network upgrades that the data centres require.",
      "She and fellow campaigners are fighting back. \u201cWe\u2019re working directly on the ground, opposing each data centre application and working on the local zoning, and trying to educate our local planning commission and supervisors about the issues that we see. But we're also working at the state level.\u201d",
      "Similar campaigns against data centres are springing up all over the world, including in the Republic of Ireland, where such facilities use 21% of the country\u2019s electricity.",
      "\"Our main objections to data centres revolve around their potential negative impacts on our climate, their sustainability, and local infrastructure,\" says Tony Lowes of Friends of the Irish Environment. \"When data centres rely on fossil fuel, they potentially strain the electricity grid and can undermine national renewable energy commitments.\"",
      "The group is continuing to challenge plans for a new \u20ac1.2bn ($1.3bn; \u00a31bn) data centre in County Clare on Ireland\u2019s west coast.",
      "Mr Lowes adds that while Friends of the Irish Environment would prefer to see data centre development halted altogether, there are various mitigations that might help, including sites prioritising renewable energy, and implementing energy and cooling efficiency measures.",
      "The big players in the global data centre industry are trying to allay people\u2019s concerns. This summer, for example, Microsoft launched its Data Center Community Pledge.",
      "Microsoft is promising that by next year it will procure 100% renewable energy globally. And that by 2030 it will \u201cachieve zero waste through a combination of waste reduction, reuse, recycling and composting\u201d, and become \u201cwater positive\u201d. The latter means that it aims for its data centres to return more water to the local supply than they use.",
      "Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already uses recycled water for cooling in 20 of its 125 data centres around the world, and also says it will be \u201cwater positive\u201d by 2030.",
      "Josh Levi, president of the Data Center Coalition, which represents dozens of data centre operators including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, says that data centres are leading the way on clean energy use.",
      "\"For example, wind and solar capacity contracted to data centre providers and customers represented two-thirds of the total US corporate renewables market last year, and four of the top five purchasers of renewable energy in the US are companies that operate data centres,\" he says.",
      "\"The data centre industry is also unlocking greater energy savings and efficiencies for homes, businesses, utilities, and other end users \u2013 everything from smart thermostats to grid-enhancing technologies require the digital infrastructure provided by data centres.\"",
      "The protests against data centres have also extended to South America, where campaigners say they have achieved successes.",
      "In Uruguay, for example, Google changed the design of a new facility now under construction. It was initially due to be water cooled, but the US giant switched to an air-cooled system.",
      "This followed protests in a country that has been experiencing droughts and a shortage of drinking water.",
      "\"Water use by Google in the initial proposal would have been equivalent to the daily consumption of drinking water by 55,000 people in our country,\" says Mar\u00eda Selva Ortiz of Friends of the Earth Uruguay.",
      "\"This threat to the right to water amidst a water crisis raised strong criticisms, leading Google to change the proposed technology to cool down its equipment, so the project was modified. Chillers will cool down with air instead of water.\u201d",
      "In Chile, meanwhile, Google has halted plans for a data centre over similar water use concerns.",
      "Back in Virginia, Ms Bolthouse says the firms need to do more to boost sustainability. In the long run, she says, it will be in the industry's own interests to improve data centres' environmental impact.",
      "\"What's going to happen if we continue with business as usual is that electrical prices are going to skyrocket for everybody, including the data centre industry - and that's their biggest bill, so that's going to impact them,\u201d she says. \u201cThe water scarcity issue is also going to impact them.",

      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

    "summary": "Start-up firms are looking for ways to dye clothes using less water and heat.",
    "story": [
      "In a small corner of rural Taiwan, set amongst other dye houses and small factories, the start-up Alchemie Technology is in the final phase of rolling out a project it claims will upend the global apparel industry and slash its carbon footprint.",
      "The UK-based start-up has targeted one of the dirtiest parts of the apparel industry - dyeing fabric - with the world\u2019s first digital dyeing process.",
      "\u201cTraditionally in dyeing fabric, you're steeping the fabric in water at 135 degrees celsius for up to four hours or so \u2013 gallons and tons of water. For example, to dye one ton of polyester, you're generating 30 tons of toxic wastewater,\u201d Alchemie founder Dr Alan Hudd tells me.",
      "\u201cThat is the same process that was developed 175 years ago in the northwest of England, in the Lancashire cotton mills and the Yorkshire cotton mills, and we exported it,\u201d he points out, first to the US and then onto the factories in Asia.",
      "The apparel industry uses an estimated five trillion litres of water each year to simply dye fabric, according to the World Resources Institute, a US-based non-profit research centre.",
      "The industry is, in turn, responsible for 20% of the world\u2019s industrial water pollution, while also using up vital resources like groundwater in some countries. It also releases a massive carbon footprint from start to finish \u2013 or around 10% of annual global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Alchemie says its technology can help solve that problem.",
      "Called Endeavour, its machine can compress fabric dyeing, drying, and fixing into a dramatically shorter and water-saving process.",
      "Endeavour uses the same principle as inkjet printing to rapidly and precisely fire dye onto and through the fabric, according to the company. The machine\u2019s 2,800 dispensers fire roughly 1.2 billion droplets per linear meter of fabric.",
      "\u201cWhat we're effectively doing is registering and placing a drop, a very small drop precisely and accurately onto the fabric. And we can switch these drops on and off, just like a light switch,\u201d says Dr Hudd.",
      "Alchemie claims big savings through the process: reducing water consumption by 95%, energy consumption up to 85%, and working three to five times faster than traditional processes.",
      "Developed initially in Cambridge, the company is now in Taiwan to see how Endeavour works in a real-world environment.",
      "\u201cThe UK, they\u2019re really strong in R&D projects, they\u2019re really strong in inventing new things, but certainly if you want to move to commercialisation you need to go to the real factories,\u201d says Ryan Chen, the new chief of operations at Alchemie, who has a background in textile manufacturing in Taiwan.",
      "Alchemie is not the only company attempting a nearly waterless dye process.",
      "There\u2019s the China-based textile company NTX, which has developed a heatless dye process that can cut down water use by 90% and dye by 40%, according to their website, and the Swedish start-up Imogo, which also uses a \u201cdigital spray application\u201d with similar environmental benefits.",
      "NTX and Imogo did not reply to the BBC\u2019s interview request.",
      "Kirsi Niinim\u00e4ki, a professor in design who researches the future of textiles at Finland\u2019s Aalto University, says the solutions offered by these companies look \u201cquite promising\u201d \u2013 although she adds that she would like to see more specific information about issues like the fixing process and long-term studies on fabric durability.",
      "But even though it's early days, Ms Niinim\u00e4ki says companies like Alchemie could bring real changes to the industry.",
      "\u201cAll these kinds of new technologies, I think that they are improvements. If you\u2019re able to use less water, for example, that of course means less energy, and perhaps even less chemicals \u2013 so that of course is a huge improvement.\u201d",
      "Back in Taiwan, there are still some kinks to be ironed out \u2013 like how to run the Endeavour machine in a hotter and more humid climate than the UK.",
      "Alchemie service manager, Matthew Avis, who helped rebuild Endeavour in its new factory location, discovered that the machine needs to operate in an air-conditioned environment \u2013 an important lesson given how much apparel manufacturing happens in southern Asia.",
      "The company also has some big goals for 2025. After its test run with polyester in Taiwan, Alchemie is heading next to South Asia and Portugal to test their machines and also try it out on cotton.",
      "They will also have to figure out how to scale up Endeavour.",
      "Big fashion companies like Inditex, the owner of Zara, work with thousands of factories. Its suppliers would need hundreds of Endeavours working together to meet its demand for fabric dyeing.",
      "And that\u2019s just one company - there will be many, many more in need.",

      "Then, in September, a man was arrested for pointing a rifle at Trump who was golfing on his course in West Palm Beach.",
      "Mr Shakeri was asked to come up with a plan to kill Trump in seven days, the indictment alleges.",
      "According to prosecutors, Mr Shakeri told law enforcement that he did not intend to propose a scheme to kill Trump within that seven-day timeframe, so the Iranian Revolutionary Guard officials put the plan on pause.",
      "Mr Shakeri said the Iranian government told him it would be easier to try to assassinate Trump after the election, because they believed he would lose, prosecutors said.",
      "Prosecutors described Mr Shakeri as an Afghan national who came to the US when he was a child. He was eventually deported around 2008 after spending 14 years in prison for a robbery conviction.",

      "Mr Shakeri promised Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt $100,000 to murder the American journalist, who had reported on the Iranian regime\u2019s human rights abuses and corruption, prosecutors alleged. The journalist, who was not named, had been targeted in the past, prosecutors said.",
      "In a post on social media Friday, Brooklyn-based journalist Masih Alinejad said the FBI had arrested two men for attempting to kill her. She said the alleged killers came to the front of her house in Brooklyn.",
      "\"I came to America to practice my First Amendment right to freedom of speech\u2014I don\u2019t want to die,\" Ms Alinejad wrote. \"I want to fight against tyranny, and I deserve to be safe.\"",
      "In addition to the American journalist and Trump, the indictment alleges the Iranian government sought to kill two Jewish American businesspeople living in New York City, who were supportive of Israel on social media.",
      "Mr Shakeri also told prosecutors that his Iranian contacts asked him to plan a mass shooting to target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka in October 2024, a year after the Hamas attacks on Israel.",
      "Mr Shakeri, Mr Rivera and Mr Loadholt were all charged with murder-for-hire, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. They also face counts of money laundering conspiracy - which could lead to 20 years in prison - and conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire."

      "If you are not wearing a mask or you lower it for a moment, you will immediately inhale the bitter air.",
      "Your throat might start to feel itchy and sore. As it gets worse, you start sneezing and coughing. But it's worse for others: children, the elderly, those with breathing difficulties. The hospitals know to expect the influx.",
      "Lahore and its 13 million residents have now been choking for a week; the air quality index has passed the 1,000 mark repeatedly this month - anything above 300 is considered hazardous.",
      "Pakistani officials have scrambled to respond to the crisis - its scale unprecedented even in a city which deals with smog at this time each year.",
      "Schools are closed, workers have been told to stay home and people urged to stay indoors - part of a so-called \u201cgreen lockdown\u201d, which has also seen motorbike rickshaws, heavy vehicles and motorbike parking banned from hot spot areas.",

      "The same image, six weeks earlier, shows clear skies and - crucially - far fewer fires.",
      "A major cause of the smog is the fires which are caused by the burning of stubble after harvest by farmers in both Pakistan and India -  a quick way to clear their fields ready for the next crops.",
      "This year, Nasa estimates it will count \u201cbetween 15,500 and 18,500 fires \u201d, according to Hiren Jethva, a senior research scientist at Nasa\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center and Morgan State University, higher than most years.",
      "According to Pakistan\u2019s environment protection authorities, around 30% of Lahore\u2019s smog comes from across the border in India. The Indian government has this year doubled fines for farmers caught stubble-burning as it tries to deal with the issue.",
      "But much of Lahore\u2019s air pollution comes from its five million motorbikes and millions of other vehicles\u2019 exhausts. On Friday, Lahore's high court identified heavy traffic emissions as the main cause of the smog, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.",
      "Then there are the industries in the city\u2019s outskirts - like the coal-fired brick kilns - adding even more pollution to the air.",

      "Nigeria has announced that free emergency Caesarean sections will be made available to \"poor and vulnerable\" women in an ambitious plan to bring down the high number of mothers dying in childbirth.",
      "At 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, Africa's most populous nation has the fourth highest maternal mortality rate in the world and the lack of access to Caesareans is thought to be one of the reasons.",
      "Many pregnant women, particularly in rural Nigeria are unable to receive emergency medical care partly due to the cost.",
      "\u201cNo woman should lose her life simply because she can\u2019t afford a C-section,\u201d Health Minister Muhammad Pate said while announcing the \"powerful move\".",
      "While the price may vary across Nigeria's different states, on average, a Caesarean costs around 60,000 naira ($36;\u00a328) which can be beyond the reach of many.",

      "The health scheme covers emergency situations only, Tashikalmah Hallah, a communication adviser to the health minister, told the BBC.",
      "Social welfare units in public hospitals will help determine eligibility and identify those who cannot afford the procedure, Mr Hallah added.",
      "Pate said maternal mortality remained \"unacceptably high\".",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 11:14:58 GMT",
    "summary": "It is an embarrassing critique for Hamas, which has used religious arguments to  justify its actions.",
    "story": [
      "The most prominent Islamic scholar in Gaza has issued a rare, powerful fatwa condemning Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the devastating war in the Palestinian territory.",
      "Professor Dr Salman al-Dayah, a former dean of the Faculty of Sharia and Law at the Hamas-affiliated Islamic University of Gaza, is one of the region\u2019s most respected religious authorities, so his legal opinion carries significant weight among Gaza\u2019s two million population, which is predominantly Sunni Muslim.",
      "A fatwa is a non-binding Islamic legal ruling from a respected religious scholar usually based on the Quran or the Sunnah - the sayings and practices of the Prophet Muhammad.",
      "Dr Dayah\u2019s fatwa, which was published in a detailed six-page document, criticises Hamas for what he calls \u201cviolating Islamic principles governing jihad\u201d.",
      "Jihad means \u201cstruggle\u201d in Arabic and in Islam it can be a personal struggle for spiritual improvement or a military struggle against unbelievers.",
      "Dr Dayah adds: \u201cIf the pillars, causes, or conditions of jihad are not met, it must be avoided in order to avoid destroying people\u2019s lives. This is something that is easy to guess for our country\u2019s politicians, so the attack must have been avoided.\u201d",
      "For Hamas, the fatwa represents an embarrassing and potentially damaging critique, particularly as the group often justifies its attacks on Israel through religious arguments to garner support from Arab and Muslim communities.",
      "The 7 October attack saw hundreds of Hamas gunmen from Gaza invade southern Israel. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 others taken hostage.",
      "Israel responded by launching a military campaign to destroy Hamas, during which more than 43,400 people have been killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.",

      "Israel Gaza war: History of the conflict explained",
      "What is Hamas and why is it fighting with Israel in Gaza?",
      "Dr Dayah argues that the significant civilian casualties in Gaza, together with the widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian disaster that have followed the 7 October attack, means that it was in direct contradiction to the teachings of Islam.",
      "Hamas, he says, has failed in its obligations of \u201ckeeping fighters away from the homes of defenceless [Palestinian] civilians and their shelters, and providing security and safety as much as possible in the various aspects of life... security, economic, health, and education, and saving enough supplies for them.\u201d",
      "Dr Dayah points to Quranic verses and the Sunnah that set strict conditions for the conduct of jihad, including the necessity of avoiding actions that provoke an excessive and disproportionate response by an opponent.",
      "His fatwa highlights that, according to Islamic law, a military raid should not trigger a response that exceeds the intended benefits of the action.",
      "He also stresses that Muslim leaders are obligated to ensure the safety and well-being of non-combatants, including by providing food, medicine, and refuge to those not involved in the fighting.",
      "\u201cHuman life is more precious to God than Mecca,\u201d Dr Dayah states.",
      "His opposition to the 7 October attack is especially significant given his deep influence in Gaza, where he is seen as a key religious figure and a vocal critic of Islamist movements, including Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.",
      "His moderate Salafist beliefs place him in direct opposition to Hamas\u2019s approach to armed resistance and its ties to Shia-ruled Iran.",
      "Salafists are fundamentalists who seek to adhere the example of the Prophet Muhammad and the first generations who followed him.",
      "Dr Dayah has consistently argued for the establishment of an Islamic caliphate that adheres strictly to Islamic law, rather than the political party-based systems that Hamas and other groups advocate.",
      "\u201cOur role model is the Prophet Muhammad, who founded a nation and did not establish political parties that divide the nation. Therefore, parties in Islam are forbidden,\u201d he said in a sermon he gave at a mosque several years ago.",
      "He has also condemned extremism, opposing jihadist groups like Islamic State and al-Qaeda, and has used all of his platforms to issue fatwas on various social and political issues, ranging from commercial transactions, social disputes over marriage and divorce, to the conduct of political violence.",
      "The fatwa adds to the growing internal debate within Gaza and the broader Arab world over the moral and legal implications of Hamas\u2019s actions, and it is likely to fuel further divisions within Palestinian society regarding the use of armed resistance in the ongoing conflict with Israel.",
      "Sheikh Ashraf Ahmed, one of Dr Dayah\u2019s students who was forced to leave his house in Gaza City last year and flee to the south of Gaza with his wife and nine children, told the BBC: \u201cOur scholar [Dr Dayah] refused to leave his home in northern Gaza despite the fears of Israeli air strikes. He chose to fulfil his religious duty by issuing his legal opinion on the attack\u201d.",
      "Ahmed described the fatwa as the most powerful legal judgment of a historical moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply well researched document, reflecting Dayah\u2019s commitment to Islamic jurisprudence,\u201d he said."

      "It is understood that one of its representatives approached the COP29 team posing as the head of a fictitious Hong Kong investment firm specialising in energy.",
      "He said this company was interested in sponsoring the COP29 summit but wanted to discuss investment opportunities in Azerbaijan's state energy firm, Socar, in return. An online meeting with Soltanov was arranged.",
      "During the meeting, Soltanov told the potential sponsor that the aim of the conference was \"solving the climate crisis\" and \"transitioning away from hydrocarbons in a just, orderly and equitable manner\".",
      "Anyone, he said, including oil and gas companies, \"could come with solutions\" because Azerbaijan\u2019s \"doors are open\".",
      "However, he said he was open to discussions about deals too \u2013 including on oil and gas.",
      "Initially, Soltanov suggested the potential sponsor might be interested in investing in some of the \"green transitioning projects\" Socar was involved in - but then spoke of opportunities related to Azerbaijan's plans to increase gas production, including new pipeline infrastructure.",
      "\"There are a lot of joint ventures that could be established,\" Soltanov says on the recording. \"Socar is trading oil and gas all over the world, including in Asia.\"",
      "Soltanov then described natural gas as a \"transitional fuel\", adding: \"We will have a certain amount of oil and natural gas being produced, perhaps forever.\"",
      "The UN climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, acknowledges there will be a role for some oil and gas up to 2050 and beyond. However, it has been very clear that \"developing\u2026 new oil and gas fields is incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C\".",
      "It also goes against the agreement the world made at the last global climate summit to transition away from fossil fuels.",

      "Attempting to do business deals as part of the COP process appears to be a serious breach of the standards of conduct expected of a COP official.",
      "These events are supposed to be about reducing the world's use of fossil fuels \u2013 the main driver of climate change \u2013 not selling more.",
      "The standards are set by the UN body responsible for the climate negotiations, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).",
      "The UN said it could not comment directly on our findings but remarked that \"the same rigorous standards\" are applied to whoever hosts the conference, and that those standards reflect \"the importance of impartiality on the part of all presiding officers\".",

    "summary": "Sentencing would likely spark more delay requests from Trump and open up an unprecedented new legal front.",
    "story": [
      "Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House effectively slammed the door on the two cases involving federal criminal charges against him.",
      "A state case against him for allegedly conspiring to interfere with Georgia\u2019s election in 2020 will go on hold until after his term in office ends - if it's still alive by then.",
      "But next week, the fate of the remaining case \u2013 his conviction on 34 felony counts in New York \u2013 will be determined. It could stand, or it could be swept away in the same political and legal tide that has allowed him to escape the others.",
      "Justice Juan Merchan will decide by Tuesday whether to grant Trump\u2019s pre-election request to throw out his conviction. Should Justice Merchan side with Trump, it would almost wipe clean his slate of criminal woes.",
      "But should the judge uphold the conviction, he would proceed to sentencing later this month. It would likely spark even more delay attempts from Trump and open up an unprecedented new front for America\u2019s criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cThis is truly uncharted territory,\u201d said Anna Cominsky, a professor at the New York Law School.",
      "Will Trump\u2019s case get thrown out?",
      "In May, a New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records. The convictions stemmed from Trump\u2019s attempt to cover up reimbursements to his ex-lawyer, Michael Cohen, who in 2016 paid off an adult film star to remain silent about an alleged sexual encounter with Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s lawyers argue that a recent US Supreme Court ruling granting presidents a degree of immunity from criminal prosecution applies to certain aspects of his New York case, and therefore the indictment and conviction should be tossed.",
      "During the trial, Justice Merchan dismissed attempts by Trump\u2019s lawyers to throw out the case on immunity grounds. But that was before the US Supreme Court ruled in Trump\u2019s favour this summer \u2013 and before Trump decisively won re-election.",
      "Justice Merchan has set a deadline of 12 November to decide whether to grant Trump\u2019s request.",
      "If he throws out the conviction, that will be the end of the case.",
      "But if he denies the defence's request, Trump\u2019s much-delayed sentencing will remain scheduled for 26 November.",
      "An unprecedented sentencing \u2013 with jail unlikely",
      "Even if Justice Merchan upholds the conviction and keeps the scheduled sentencing, Trump\u2019s team is almost certain to seek more delays and appeals.",
      "Todd Blanche, Trump\u2019s lead attorney, did not respond to inquiries about whether he planned to seek a delay.",
      "Because Trump will be tied up with a presidential transition and the legal questions about sentencing a president are so complex, some scholars see very little chance it will stay on the calendar.",
      "\u201cI think the most likely outcome in the state case is the judge putting off sentencing until after Trump's term in office,\u201d said Daniel Charles Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School.",
      "\u201cTo actually impose a sentence would raise any number of messy issues in the short term,\u201d including political ones, he said.",
      "If Trump does find himself in a Manhattan courtroom later this month, deciding his fate still would be an unprecedented challenge.",
      "Under the law, Trump faces a range of sentences, including fines, probation and up to four years in prison. But many options are rendered impractical by his imminent return to the White House.",
      "\u201cSentencing a sitting president may be one of the most complicated, fraught sentencing decisions you can imagine,\u201d Ms Cominsky said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine what sentence could be imposed that would not impede a president\u2019s ability to do their job or compromise the president\u2019s security.\"",
      "Few expect Justice Merchan to sentence Trump to a stint behind bars at this point.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a 78-year old man with no criminal history, who has been convicted of a non-violent felony,\u201d said retired New York Supreme Court Justice Diane Kiesel. \u201cI don\u2019t think a judge would give a person under those sentences an incarceration sentence.\u201d",
      "Even if Justice Merchan did reach for such a sentence, Trump\u2019s team would almost certainly appeal it, delaying actual punishment.",
      "Trump could leave a sentencing hearing with the legal equivalent of a slap on the wrist. Justice Merchan could ask the former president to pay a relatively small fine in the three- or four-figure range.",
      "He could also give Trump an unconditional discharge; \u201cbasically, goodbye,\u201d as Justice Kiesel puts it.",
      "Trump has no pardon power here",
      "The only thing that is certain is that Trump cannot make this conviction go away on his own.",
      "Trump has explored the possibility of pardoning himself from potential criminal charges in the past, and could do so for his federal indictments when he becomes president in January.",
      "But he cannot pardon himself in New York, as the conviction occurred in state court.",
      "His fate, at the moment, is in the hands of the court. But regardless of the outcome, Trump will likely avoid the most serious punishments facing him.",

    "summary": "The mass deportation of undocumented immigrants would face legal and practical challenges - and cost billions.",
    "story": [
      "US President-elect Donald Trump has doubled down on his campaign promise of the mass deportation of illegal immigrants, saying the cost of doing so will not be a deterrent.",
      "In some of his first public remarks since winning the election, Trump said his priority upon taking office in January would be to make the border \u201cstrong and powerful\".",
      "\"It\u2019s not a question of a price tag. It\u2019s not - really, we have no choice,\" Trump told NBC News.",
      "But how would Trump\u2019s campaign pledge of mass deportations of migrants actually work and what are the hurdles he may face?",
      "What are the legal challenges?",
      "The latest figures from the Department of Homeland Security and Pew Research indicate that there are around 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US, a number that has remained relatively stable since 2005.",
      "Most are long-term residents - nearly four-fifths have been in the country for more than a decade.",
      "Immigrants who are in the country without legal status have the right to due process, including a court hearing before their removal. A drastic increase in deportations would likely entail a large expansion in the immigration court system, which has been beset by backlogs.",
      "Most immigrants already in the country enter into the deportation system not through encounters with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents but through local law enforcement.",
      "However, many of the country\u2019s largest cities and counties have passed laws restricting local police co-operation with Ice.",
      "Trump has pledged to take action against these \u201csanctuary cities\u201d, but America\u2019s patchwork of local, state and federal laws further complicates the picture.",

      "These are the seven things Trump says he will do as president",
      "Analysis - Why Kamala Harris lost",
      "Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, or MPI, said that co-operation between Ice and local officials would be a \"critical\" aspect of any mass deportation programme.",
      "\"It's much easier for Ice to pick someone up from a jail if local law enforcement co-operates, instead of having to go look for them,\" she said.",
      "As an example, Ms Bush-Joseph pointed to an early August declaration from the sheriff's offices of Florida's Broward and Palm Beach counties, in which they said they would not deploy deputies to help any mass deportation plan.",
      "\"There are many others who would not co-operate with a Trump mass deportation plan,\" she said. \"That makes it so much harder.\"",
      "Any mass deportation programme is also likely to be almost immediately met with a flurry of legal challenges from immigration and human rights activists.",
      "A 2022 Supreme Court ruling, however, means that courts cannot issue injunctions on immigration enforcement policies - meaning they would continue even as the challenges work their way through the legal system.",
      "But can it be done, logistically?",
      "If a US administration was able to legally move ahead with plans for mass deportations, authorities would still have to contend with enormous logistical challenges.",
      "During the Biden administration, deportation efforts have focused on migrants recently detained at the border. Migrants deported from further inland in the US, from areas not located near the border, are, overwhelmingly, those with criminal histories or deemed national security threats.",
      "Controversial raids on worksites that were carried out during the Trump administration were suspended in 2021.",
      "Deportations of people arrested in the US interior - as opposed to those at the border - have hovered at below 100,000 for a decade, after peaking at over 230,000 during the early years of the Obama administration.",
      "\"To raise that, in a single year, up to a million would require a massive infusion of resources that likely don't exist,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, policy director at the American Immigration Council, told the BBC.",
      "For one, experts are doubtful that Ice's 20,000 agents and support personnel would be enough to find and track down even a fraction of the figures being touted by the Trump campaign.",
      "Mr Reichlin-Melnick added that the deportation process is long and complicated and only begins with the identification and arrest of an undocumented migrant.",
      "After that, detainees would need to be housed or placed on an \"alternative to detention\" programme before they are brought before an immigration judge, in a system with a years-long backlog.",
      "Only then are detainees removed from the US, a process that requires diplomatic co-operation from the receiving country.",
      "\"In each of those areas, Ice simply does not have the capacity to process millions of people,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said.",
      "Trump has said he would involve the National Guard or other US military forces to help with deportations.",
      "Historically, the US military's role in immigration matters has been limited to support functions at the US-Mexico border.",
      "Aside from the use of the military and \"using local law enforcement\", Trump has offered few specifics on how such a mass deportation plan could be carried out.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine earlier this year, the former president said only that he would \"not rule out\" building new migrant detention facilities, and that he would move to give police immunity from prosecution from \"the liberal groups or the progressive groups\".",
      "He added that there could also be incentives for state and local police departments to participate, and that those who do not \"won't partake in the riches\".",
      "\"We have to do this,\" he said. \"This is not a sustainable problem for our country.\"",
      "Eric Ruark, the director of research at NumbersUSA - an organisation that advocates for tighter immigration controls - said that any deportation programme from the interior would only be effective if coupled with increased border enforcement.",
      "\"That has to be the priority. You're going to make very little progress in the interior if that's not the case,\" he said. \"That's what keeps people showing up.\"",
      "Additionally, Mr Ruark said that a crackdown on companies that hire undocumented migrants would also be necessary.",
      "\"They're coming for jobs,\" he said. \"And they're getting those jobs because interior enforcement has basically been dismantled.\"",
      "The financial and political costs",
      "Experts estimate that the total bill for one million or more deportations would run into tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars.",
      "The Ice budget for transportation and deportation in 2023 was $420m (\u00a3327m). In that year the agency deported slightly more than 140,000 people.",
      "Thousands of immigrants would be detained while awaiting court hearings or deportations, and the Trump campaign has envisioned building large encampments to house them all.",
      "The number of removal flights would also need to be dramatically expanded, possibly requiring military aircraft to augment current capacity.",
      "Just a small expansion in any of these areas could result in significant costs.",
      "\"Even a minor change is in the tens of millions, or hundreds of millions,\" Mr Reichlin-Melnick said. \"A significant change is in the tens or hundreds of millions.\"",
      "Those costs would be in addition to the expense of other border enforcement efforts that Trump has promised: continuing work on a southern US border wall, a naval blockade to prevent fentanyl entering the country, and moving thousands of troops to the border.",
      "Adam Isacson, a migration and border expert from the Washington Office on Latin America, said that \"nightmarish images\" of mass deportations could also cost a potential Trump administration politically from a public relations standpoint.",
      "\"Every community in the US would see people they know and love put on buses,\" Mr Isacson said.",
      "\"You'd have some very painful images on TV of crying children, and families,\" he added. \"All of that is incredibly bad press. It's family separation, but on steroids.\"",
      "Have mass deportations happened before?",
      "Under the four years of the previous Trump administration, around 1.5 million people were deported, both from the border and the US interior.",
      "The Biden administration - which had deported about 1.1 million people up to February 2024 - is on track to match that, statistics show.",
      "During the two terms of the Obama administration - when Mr Biden was vice-president - more than three million people were deported, leading some immigration reform advocates to dub Barack Obama the \"deporter-in-chief\".",
      "The only historical comparison to a mass deportation programme came in 1954, when as many as 1.3 million people were deported as part of Operation Wetback, named after a derogatory slur then commonly used against Mexican people.",
      "That figure is disputed by historians, however.",
      "The programme, under President Dwight Eisenhower, ran into considerable public opposition - partly because some US citizens were also deported - as well as a lack of funding. It was largely discontinued by 1955.",
      "Immigration experts say that the earlier operation's focus on Mexican nationals and lack of due process makes it incomparable to what a modern-day mass deportation programme would look like.",
      "\"Those [deported in the 1950s] were single, Mexican men,\" said MPI's Kathleen Bush-Joseph.",
      "\"Now, the vast majority of people coming between ports of entry are from places that are not Mexico, or even northern Central America. It makes it so much harder to return them,\" she added.",

      "1) Deport undocumented migrants",
      "While campaigning, Trump promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history.",
      "He also pledged to complete the building of a wall at the border with Mexico that was started during his first presidency.",
      "The number of crossings at the US southern border hit record levels at the end of last year during the Biden-Harris administration, before falling in 2024.",
      "Experts have told the BBC that deportations on the scale promised by Trump would face huge legal and logistical challenges - and could slow economic growth.",
      "2) Moves on economy, tax and tariffs",
      "Exit poll data has suggested the economy was a key issue for voters. Trump has promised to \"end inflation\" - which rose to high levels under President Joe Biden before falling again. But a president's power to directly influence prices is limited.",
      "He has also promised sweeping tax cuts, extending his overhaul from 2017. He has proposed making tips tax-free, abolishing tax on social security payments and shaving corporation tax.",
      "He has proposed new tariffs of at least 10% on most foreign goods, to cut the trade deficit. Imports from China could bear an additional 60% tariff, he has said. Some economists have warned that such moves could push up prices for ordinary people.",
      "3) Cut climate regulations",
      "During his first presidency, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections and made America the first nation to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement.",

    "summary": "India has built a 3km-long runway on Agalega and no-one has fully explained why, angering residents.",
    "story": [
      "Arnaud Poulay never wanted to leave the tiny Indian Ocean island of Agalega, but this year he packed his bag and took off, broken-hearted by what he regards as the militarisation of his home.",
      "Until recently, just 350 people lived on Agalega, fishing and growing coconuts. Other food was delivered four times a year by ship from the capital of Mauritius, 1,100km (680 miles) to the south. A small airstrip was rarely used except in medical emergencies.",
      "But in 2015, Mauritius, an island nation of which Agalega is a part, signed a deal enabling India to build a vast 3,000m (3km) runway and a big new jetty there, as part of the two countries' deepening collaboration on maritime security.",
      "However some Agalegans fear this could grow into a fully-fledged military presence.",
      "Mr Poulay, a 44-year-old handyman and reggae musician, led a campaign against the project.",
      "\u201cI love my island and my island loves me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut when that base was unveiled, I knew I had to leave.\u201d",
      "Agalega - two small islands covering 25 sq km, in the south-west Indian Ocean \u2013 would be an ideal location for India to monitor marine traffic. And a comparison of satellite images from 2019 with others taken in July this year shows how much has changed.",
      "A carpet of palm trees has made way for the runway, which stretches along the spine of the north island between the two main villages - La Fourche in the north and Vingt-Cinq further south.",
      "Two 60m-wide buildings can be seen sitting on a tarmac apron, at least one of which could be a hangar to accommodate the Indian navy\u2019s P-8I aircraft, according to Samuel Bashfield, a PhD scholar at the Australian National University.",
      "The P-8I is a Boeing 737 modified to hunt and potentially attack submarines, and to monitor maritime communications. Islanders have already photographed the aircraft on the airstrip.",
      "To the north-west is the new jetty jutting out into the ocean, which Mr Bashfield says could be used by Indian surface patrol vessels, as well as the ship that brings supplies to Agalega.",
      "\u201cAs newer satellite images become available, we\u2019ll better understand Agalega\u2019s role in Indian Ocean communications,\u201d he says.",
      "The International Institute for Strategic Studies refers to the facility as a \u201csurveillance station\u201d and says it is likely to contain a coastal radar surveillance system similar to Indian-built equipment elsewhere in Mauritius.",
      "The Indian government declined to answer questions about Agalega, and referred the BBC to earlier statements on its website. In one of these, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said India and Mauritius were \"natural partners\" in maritime security, facing traditional and non-traditional challenges in the Indian Ocean region.",
      "The two countries have had a close defence relationship since the 1970s. The country\u2019s national security adviser, its coastguard chief and the head of the police helicopter squadron are all Indian nationals and officers in India's external intelligence agency, navy and air force, respectively.",
      "Both sides would want the facility to be seen \u201cas one that is more about capacity building than for any overt military use\u201d, says Prof Harsh Pant, of the India Institute at King\u2019s College London.",
      "It\u2019s no secret, though, that India and its Western allies are concerned about China\u2019s increasing presence in the Indian Ocean.",
      "While it\u2019s not unusual for a large country to establish a military outpost on the territory of a smaller ally, the construction work on Agalega has troubled some islanders.",
      "A number of areas, including some of the island\u2019s palm-fringed white-sand beaches, have already been cordoned off, islanders say. There are also persistent rumours that the village of La Fourche will be swallowed by the Indian infrastructure that has grown up around it, and that the 10 families who live there will be forced out.",
      "\"It will become a restricted area completely for Indians,\" says Laval Soopramanien, president of the Association of Friends of Agalega.",
      "He fears that \u201cAgalega will become the story of the Chagos islands\" - a concern echoed by 26-year-old handyman Billy Henri, who is the son of an Agalegan and a woman expelled from the Chagos islands.",
      "\"My mother [lost] her island,\" says Mr Henri. \"My father will be the next.\"",
      "A number of Agalega\u2019s residents are from families scarred by eviction from the Chagos Islands, 2,000km to the east, after the UK government declared them in 1965 to be British territory and granted the US permission to build a communications station on the largest island, Diego Garcia. This gradually became a fully-fledged military base.",
      "Billy Henri fears that the Mauritius government, which owns all land on Agalega and is the only employer, is trying to make conditions so miserable that everyone will leave.",
      "He points to problems with healthcare and education, limited investment in the local economy, a lack of job opportunities, and a ban on local people opening their own businesses.",
      "A Mauritius government spokesman told the BBC that no-one would be asked to leave, and that local people were only prevented from entering the airport and the port \u2013 facilities that he said would help the country control piracy, drug-trafficking and unregulated fishing.",
      "Mauritius also denies suggestions that Agalega hosts a military base, saying that the national police are still in full control. However, it acknowledges that India will assist in the \u201cmaintenance and operation\u201d of the new facilities, which were built at Indian expense.",
      "The Mauritius and Indian governments say the improvements to sea and air transportation were designed to benefit the islanders and help lift them out of poverty. But local people say this hasn\u2019t happened: there are still only four ferries to the main island of Mauritius every year, and no passenger flights.",
      "Agalegans say they are barred from a new Indian-built hospital, even though a Mauritius government press release vaunted its operating theatres, X-ray machines and dentistry equipment.",
      "Billy Henri says that a boy suffering from cooking oil burns, who needed more help than he could get from the north island\u2019s health centre, was refused entry in October.",
      "\"It's only for Indians!\" he says.",
      "The injured boy and his parents were flown to the main island of Mauritius instead. Laval Soopramanien says the boy is still in hospital there, and that the family will remain on the main island until the next boat leaves for Agalega.",
      "The Mauritius government did not respond, when asked to comment on the plight of the boy with burns. The Indian government declined to comment.",
      "In a recent speech to the Mauritius parliament, Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said the socio-economic development of Agalega was higher than ever on his government\u2019s agenda.",
      "A \u201cmaster plan\u201d had been drawn up to improve health and education, transport connections and recreational facilities for the island\u2019s residents, and to develop the fishing sector and the exploitation of coconut by-products, he said.",

    "story": [
      "For over two millennia, the Roman temples at Baalbek in eastern Lebanon have stood as some of the finest examples of Roman architecture anywhere in the world.",
      "On Wednesday, a car park just metres away from the Unesco World Heritage site was hit by an Israeli air strike.",
      "The attack, which also destroyed a centuries-old Ottoman building, highlighted what some archaeologists say is the risk of irreparable damage to historical sites across Lebanon from the current war between Israel and Hezbollah.",
      "\"Baalbek is the major Roman site in Lebanon. You couldn't replace it if someone bombed it,\" says Graham Philip, an archaeology professor at Durham University.",
      "\"It would be a huge loss. It would be a crime.\"",
      "Since late September, Israel has pummelled Lebanon with thousands of air strikes in an escalation of its campaign against Hezbollah, the Iran-backed group it has been fighting in nearly a year of cross-border strikes.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has largely been targeting southern Lebanon, suburbs in the capital Beirut and the eastern Bekaa Valley.",
      "But in the past fortnight, the campaign has moved into new areas, or rather, very old ground.",
      "The IDF told the BBC that it only targets military sites. But those targets are incredibly close to the Baalbek temples and Roman ruins in Tyre, a major port of the Phoenician Empire around 2,500 years ago.",
      "According to legend, Tyre is the place where purple pigment was first created - the dye crushed out of snail shells to embroider royal robes.",
      "On 23 October, the IDF issued evacuation orders for neighbourhoods close to the city's Roman ruins, including the remains of a necropolis and a hippodrome.",
      "Hours later it began striking targets. More bombing of the sites was reported last week.",
      "Videos from the strikes showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from seafront areas only a few hundred metres from the ruins.",
      "There is no evidence that the Roman sites in Tyre and Baalbek have been damaged by the Israeli strikes. But Lebanese archaeologists are alarmed at how close the fighting has been to the millennia-old ruins, recognised by Unesco as having outstanding value to humanity.",
      "\"For Baalbek it was even worse than Tyre, because the temples are located within the area that is targeted and [the IDF] did not make any exemption for the temples,\" says local archaeologist Joanne Farchakh Bajjaly.",
      "She says there are no Hezbollah facilities at the Baalbek site: \"No one knows what the excuse or the message behind the hit is.\"",
      "The IDF disputes this. In a statement, it told the BBC it targets military sites in accordance with strict protocol, adding that it is \"aware of the existence of sensitive sites and this is taken into account and constitutes an essential part of the planning of strikes\".",
      "\"Each strike that poses a risk to a sensitive structure is weighed carefully and goes through a rigorous approval process as required.\"",
      "Some ordinary Lebanese attempting to escape Israeli bombing reportedly fled to the Baalbek ruins, judging that ancient sites would not be targeted by Israel and would therefore offer protection.",
      "Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says \"those who didn't have a car to flee\" moved closer to the ruins, in the belief that the Unesco sites are considered more valuable than their lives.",
      "It prompted the local government to issue a warning urging people against travelling to the ruins.",
      "\"They see the site as their shelter. But the site is not a shelter,\" Ms Farchakh Bajjaly says.",
      "The war puts Israel in a \"difficult situation\", says Israeli archaeologist Erez Ben-Yosef.",
      "He said that war damage to important archaeological sites would be a \"huge loss to the cultural heritage of Lebanon and indeed the entire world.",
      "\"However, I know personally that Israel is doing everything it can to prevent such damage.",
      "\"Many of my fellow archaeologists, both colleagues and students, serve in the army and participate in the war... they actively work to prevent such damage, in accordance with the general guidelines of our military.\"",
      "Graham Philip, the Durham University archaeology professor, says he doesn\u2019t believe Israel would intentionally hit Baalbek or other sites.",
      "\"It's hard to see what they would gain in a military sense, bombing a Roman temple.\"",
      "But he cautioned about the risk of some bombs or missiles going off target and hitting the ruins, even unintentionally: \"If you drop enough ordnance, not all of that lands within 25 metres of the target.\"",
      "Mr Philip has been closely monitoring the impact of Israel's strikes on heritage sites in Gaza where it is fighting Hamas, leading a British university team documenting archaeological destruction across the territory.",
      "He says it is still too early to assess how much damage has been done by the current wars in Lebanon and Gaza. But a Unesco survey published in September found that 69 cultural heritage sites in Gaza had been damaged by the war, which was triggered by the Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023.",
      "The oldest mosque in Gaza, the Great Omari Mosque, is one. It was built on the site of an ancient Philistine temple before being converted into a church and then a mosque. It was reportedly mostly destroyed by an Israeli strike in December 2023.",
      "Mr Philip says these ancient sites are not only important anchors to the classical past, but are \"almost like the soul of a population\".",

    "summary": "A 17-year-old student was hailed as a genius, until it emerged she'd cheated.",
    "story": [
      "A 17-year-old girl in China hailed as a genius in a mathematics contest cheated, competition organisers have said - ending months of scepticism over her stellar results.",
      "Jiang Ping, a fashion design student from a rural town in Jiangsu province, made headlines in June when she came 12th in the qualifiers of an international maths contest run by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "She was the first finalist since the competition began in 2018 to have come from a lowly vocational school, Chinese media reported. The vast majority of the 800 finalists came from elite universities.",
      "Jiang's results turned her into an overnight sensation, and she was labelled a \"prodigy\" in the press and on social media.",
      "Under China's notoriously cut-throat education system, academic excellence is lauded. Many people online were encouraged by Jiang's results, seeing them as proof that students from vocational institutes could still excel academically.",
      "However, as doubt surrounding her abilities snowballed, competition organisers  said last Sunday that Jiang had violated competition rules in the preliminary round, by receiving help from her teacher, who was also a contestant himself.",
      "\u201cThis has exposed problems like inadequacies in the competition format and the lack of rigour in supervision. We sincerely apologise,\u201d organisers said in a statement.",
      "According to the final results announced on Sunday, neither Jiang nor her teacher was among 86 winners in the competition.",
      "The rise of a maths sensation",
      "The annual mathematics contest is open to contestants from institutions worldwide and hosted by Damo Academy, Alibaba\u2019s research institute.",
      "This year, Jiang, a student at Jiangsu Lianshui Secondary Vocational School, outperformed other finalists from some of the world\u2019s most prestigious institutions \u2014 including Peking University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the University of Oxford.",
      "She had chosen to study at the vocational school both because she was interested in fashion design, and because her sister and friends were there, said local media outlets.",
      "Jiang's results and unconventional educational background soon grabbed nationwide attention. Her story was featured in a video produced by Damo Academy and she was interviewed by news outlets across the country.",
      "\u201cLearning maths is bumpy, but every time I solve the problems I feel quite happy,\u201d she told the state-run People\u2019s Daily. \u201cNo matter what the future holds, I will keep learning.\u201d",
      "Jiang\u2019s teacher, Wang Runqiu, was also thrust into the spotlight, hailed as an educator who noticed and encouraged her passion for maths. Speaking to the media, he described her as an attentive student who had learnt advanced mathematics herself.",
      "\"I have encountered many setbacks in the process of learning maths,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I want to do everything I can to help my students and let them know that there are other possibilities in the future.\u201d",
      "But along with an outpouring of praise for Jiang and her teacher, the student\u2019s story also sparked a discussion about whether China\u2019s education system did enough to support gifted students in less academic pathways - especially those who may not have received similar recognition by their teachers.",
      "China's education system focuses much of its resources on those taking the \"Gaokao\" - the notoriously difficult exam that students need to take in order to get into university. Those in vocational schools had long faced restrictions in taking the gaokao and enrolling in regular universities, until an education reform in 2022 offered vocational school students an alternative university entrance exam.",
      "An earlier op-ed in state-news media outlet Xinhua said that Jiang's results \u201chint[ed] at an awkward truth: even youths as talented as her may be easily buried without good education credentials\u201d.",
      "'She was not the mastermind'",
      "But as Jiang\u2019s fame burgeoned, criticism and scepticism surrounding her skills also started to bubble.",
      "In June, dozens of other finalists published a joint letter they wrote to the competition organising committee demanding an investigation into Jiang. They also called for her answers to the preliminary test questions to be made public.",
      "The finalists alleged that Jiang had made \u201cseveral apparent writing mistakes\u201d in an online video and that she \u201cseemed unfamiliar with these mathematical expressions and symbols\u201d.",
      "While the preliminary round of the competition allowed participants to use programming software, the final round was a closed-book exam. The results of the finals, which were initially set to be released in August, were postponed for several months.",
      "When the results were finally made public on Sunday, Jiang was not among the 86 winners of the final round.",
      "Her school also confirmed in a statement on Sunday that Jiang had been helped by her teacher Wang, and that Wang had been given a warning and disqualified from teachers\u2019 awards for the year. The statement also called for leniency and protection for the teenager.",
      "Attempts by the BBC to contact Jiang's family were unsuccessful. A social media account once used by her mother is now defunct, and a phone number linked to her father has been deactivated. Multiple phone calls by the BBC to Jiang's school went unanswered, and a village official declined to discuss Jiang when contacted by the BBC.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s revelation unleashed a wave of criticism of Jiang and her teacher, many social media users also spoke up for the teenager, arguing the bigger responsibility lay with her school and teacher.",
      "\u201cJiang Ping is not innocent, that\u2019s without question. But who are the worst parties in this?\u201d reads a post on Weibo. \u201cThe adults brought this child along to do a bad deed, and let her suffer all the consequences.\u201d",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 00:01:59 GMT",
    "summary": "The birth of a great Indian bustard chick through artificial insemination has given hope to conservationists.",
    "story": [
      "Last month brought good news for the great Indian bustard, a critically endangered bird found mainly in India.",
      "Wildlife officials in the western state of Rajasthan have performed the first successful hatching of a chick through artificial insemination.",
      "A lone adult male in one of two breeding centres in Jaisalmer city was trained to produce sperm without mating, which was then used to impregnate an adult female at the second centre some 200km (124 miles) away.",
      "Officials said the development was important as it has opened up the possibility of creating a sperm bank.",
      "Over the years, habitat loss, poaching and collisions with overhead power lines have effected great Indian bustards. Their numbers have fallen from more than 1,000 in the 1960s to around 150 at present.",
      "Most of them are found in Jaisalmer and hence, conservation activists say that the bird's habitat in the city should be protected. But this land is also prime real estate for renewable energy firms, presenting authorities with a unique conservation challenge.",
      "The great Indian bustard may not be as well known as the peacock (India's national bird) but it's just as impressive, says Sumit Dookia, a conservation ecologist who has been studying the bird for close to a decade. The massive bird, which weighs between 15kg and 18kg, is one of the biggest flying birds in India.",
      "It once had a prolific presence in the country and was found in at least 11 states, but today, its population is confined to Rajasthan, while a handful might be spotted in the southern state of Karnataka and the western state of Gujarat.",
      "The shy bird plays an important role in the food chain by preying on rodents, snakes and other pests and is also the state bird of Rajasthan, where it is called 'Godawan' by locals.",
      "But some of the bird's unique evolutionary traits are clashing with human interventions, making it vulnerable to extinction.",
      "For one, the great Indian bustard has good peripheral vision but poor frontal vision, making it difficult for them to spot power lines until they fly too close to them. Their large size makes it difficult for them to quickly change their flight path and they end up colliding with the cables and dying.",
      "\"Their vision could have developed like this as the bird spends a large amount of time on land,\" says Mr Dookia. It also lays its eggs on the ground, without a nest or any other form of protection except for the watchful eye of the mother and this might have caused it to develop good side vision, he adds.",
      "The great Indian bustard also has unique breeding habits. The bird lays just one egg at a time and spends the next two years caring for its offspring.",
      "\"Since it reaches maturity at around four years of age and lives for 12-15 years, it lays just about four-five eggs in its lifetime and many of these eggs are destroyed by predators,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "Conservationists say that over the past few years, the great Indian bustard's habitat in Jaisalmer has been overrun by solar and wind energy farms, leading to an increase in flying accidents.",
      "\"The increased human presence has also created more filth, attracting stray dogs who kill the birds or destroy their eggs,\" Mr Dookia says.",
      "To boost the bird's population, the government of Rajasthan collaborated with the federal government and the Wildlife Institute of India to launch a conservation breeding centre at Sam city in 2018. Another breeding centre was set up at Ramdevra village in 2022, says Ashish Vyas, a top forest official in Jaisalmer.",
      "As a first step, researchers collected eggs found in the wild and hatched them in incubation centres. \"Currently, there are 45 birds in both the centres,14 of which are captive-bred chicks (including the one born through artificial insemination),\" he adds.",
      "The plan is to further boost the bird's population and then eventually release them into the wild. But conservationists say that this is easier said than done.",
      "This is because the birds born in these breeding centres have imprinted on human researchers (in other words, they have formed close bonds with their human caretakers) and have lost about 60-70% of their ability to survive in the wild, says Mr Dookia.",
      "\"Human imprinting is necessary for feeding and handling the birds but it also makes them lose their natural instincts. It will be extremely challenging to re-wild them, especially if there's no habitat left for the birds to be released into,\" he adds.",
      "The loss of habitat has also resulted in another problem: researchers have noticed that the birds, which used to migrate across states, have almost completely stopped doing so. Even in Jaisalmer, where the birds are found in two pockets - Pokhran in the eastern part of the city and the Desert National Park in the west - there's hardly any cross-migration, says Mr Dookia.",
      "It's likely that the birds have stopped migrating over large distances in response to flying accidents, he adds. This increases the risk of inbreeding, which could result in birth defects.",
      "\"Thus, the only solution to conserve the great Indian bustard is to preserve its natural habitat,\" he says.",
      "But a Supreme Court judgement from April has made conservationists uneasy.",
      "The court overturned an earlier interim order, which had instructed Rajasthan and Gujarat to prioritise moving power cables underground in great Indian bustard habitats. The order had created a furore among renewable energy firms, who said that this would cost them billions of rupees and virtually kill their business.",
      "In its latest judgment, the court observed that people had the right to be free from the harmful effects of climate change and that shifting large sections of power cables underground may not be feasible for firms from a monetary and technical standpoint.",
      "It also directed that a committee be set up to look into the feasibility of moving power lines and the efficacy of bird diverters - devices that have reflectors and are attached to power cables to alert birds about their presence.",
      "While corporates have hailed the top court's judgment, conservationists and some legal experts say that it's problematic as it pits one good cause against another.",
      "\"The judgment brings into focus a flawed understanding of the interplay between climate change, biodiversity and development issues,\" ecologist Debadityo Sinha wrote in a column.",
      "He noted that many highly-populated cities in India have underground power lines and that other states have taken such a step to protect other bird species in the past. He also pointed out that although moving power cables underground is expensive, it's likely to amount to a fraction of a firm's total earnings.",
      "Mr Dookia says that one of the reasons renewable energy companies are flocking to Rajasthan is because of the low cost of land.",
      "\"There's also not much research on how these renewable energy farms will impact the state's climate and ecology in the long run,\" he says.",
      "\"So it's not just the bird's future that hangs in the balance, it's also man's.\"",

    "summary": "Big mining firms are switching to driverless trucks and other autonomous equipment.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't get much more remote than this. I'm in inland Western Australia, at Rio Tinto\u2019s Greater Nammuldi iron ore mine.",
      "It's about a two-hour flight north from Perth in a region called the Pilbara.",
      "No-one lives permanently here. Around 400 workers are on the site at any one time, and they are flown in, working between four and eight days, depending on their shift pattern, before flying home.",
      "Giant trucks the size of townhouses, capable of hauling 300 tonnes, criss-cross red-earth roads in various sections of this open-pit mine complex.",
      "For an outsider like me their size is intimidating enough, but multiplying that feeling is the knowledge that there's no driver at the wheel.",
      "During a tour of the site in a normal-sized company vehicle, one of the trucks comes into view, approaching from a side road.",
      "I sigh with relief as it deftly turns and continues in the direction we have just come. \u201cDid it make you feel uncomfortable?,\u201d asks the vehicle\u2019s driver Dwane Pallentine, a production superintendent.",
      "Greater Nammuldi has a fleet of more than 50 self-driving trucks that operate independently on pre-defined courses, along with a handful that remain manually driven and work separately in a different part of the mine.",
      "Being trialled is also an autonomous water cart affectionately known as Henry, which, along with manually driven ones, sprays the mine roads to keep the dust down.",
      "The company vehicle I am in is able to operate alongside the autonomous trucks only because it has been fitted with high-accuracy GPS, which allows it to be seen within a virtual system.",
      "Before entering the mine\u2019s gated autonomous zone, we logged onto this system and a controller verified over the radio that we were visible.",
      "It has encased our vehicle in a virtual bubble that the self-driving trucks \"see\" and which causes them to manage their proximity by slowing or stopping as necessary.",
      "A touch screen in our cabin displays all the staffed and autonomous vehicles and other equipment in the vicinity, along with \"permission lines\" that show the immediate routes the self-driving trucks are intending to take. Had I looked at the screen instead of fretting I would have seen that truck was going to turn.",
      "In addition to all vehicles being fitted with a big red emergency button that can stop the system, the autonomous trucks have lasers and radars front and rear to detect collision risks.",
      "The sensors also detect obstacles. If a large rock fell off the back of a truck, the sensors on the next truck along would notice it and the vehicle would stop.",
      "However, some trucks seem extra sensitive \u2013 on my tour I see a couple foiled simply by rough roads.",
      "Co-ordinating and monitoring these robots is Rio Tinto\u2019s Operations Centre (OC) in Perth, about 1,500km (930 miles) to the south.",
      "It\u2019s the nerve centre for all the company\u2019s Pilbara iron ore operations, which span 17 mines in total, including the three making up Greater Nammuldi.",
      "Guided from here by controllers, include more than 360 self-driving trucks across all the sites (about 84% of the total fleet is automated); a mostly autonomous long-distance rail network to transport the mined ore to port facilities; and nearly 40 autonomous drills. OC staff also remotely control plant and port functions.",
      "Autonomy isn\u2019t new to Rio\u2019s Pilbara operations: introduction began in the late 2000s.",
      "Nor is it unique: Australia has the greatest number of autonomous trucks and mines that use automation of any country, and other mining companies in the Pilbara also use the technology.",
      "But the scale Rio has grown its operations to here, including at Greater Nammuldi \u2013 which has one of the largest autonomous truck fleets in the world \u2013 gives it global significance.",
      "And it's a global trend. According to GlobalData the number of self-driving haul trucks worldwide has roughly quadrupled over the past four years to more than 2,000, with most made by either Caterpillar or Komatsu.",
      "The biggest reason for introducing the technology has been to improve the physical safety of the workforce, says Matthew Holcz, the managing director of the company\u2019s Pilbara mines.",
      "Mining is a dangerous occupation: heavy machinery can be unpredictably operated by people who can also become fatigued. \u201cThe data clearly shows that, through automation, we've got a significantly safer business,\u201d says Mr Holcz.",
      "It has also improved productivity \u2013 to the tune of about 15%, he estimates. Autonomous equipment can be used more because there are no gaps due to shift changes or breaks. And autonomous trucks can also go faster when there is less staff-operated equipment on the scene.",
      "Such automation does not come cheap. Rio won\u2019t disclose what it has spent in total on its Pilbara automation journey to date, but observers put it at multiple billions of dollars.",
      "Meanwhile, employment opportunities have evolved. The narrative might be one of robots taking jobs, but that doesn\u2019t seem the case here so far.",
      "While the OC has about one controller for every 25 autonomous trucks \u2013 according to Rio, no one has lost their job because of automation.",
      "Instead, there have been redeployments: truck drivers have joined the OC as controllers themselves, been reskilled to operate different pieces of equipment, such as excavators, loaders and dozers, or gone to drive manual trucks at different sites.",
      "On the OC\u2019s large open plan floor, amid the banks of monitors arranged in clusters for the different mines, I meet Jess Cowie who used be a manual driller but now directs autonomous ones from the central drill pod. \u201cI still put holes in the ground\u2026just without the dust, the noise and being away from the family,\u201d she says.",
      "Automation is delivering a \u201cstep change\u201d in terms of safety in the mining industry says Robin Burgess-Limerick, a professor at the University of Queensland in Brisbane who studies human factors in mining. But it doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for improvement.",
      "Professor Burgess-Limerick has analysed incidents involving autonomous equipment reported to regulators.",
      "As he sees it, the interfaces used by staff both in the field and in control centres to gain information aren\u2019t optimally designed. There have been situations where field staff have lost awareness of the situation, which better screen design may have prevented. \u201cThe designers of the technology should put a bit more effort into considering people,\u201d he says.",
      "And there is also a risk that controllers\u2019 workloads can be overwhelming - it is a busy, high stakes job.",
      "Over-trust, where people become so confident the autonomous equipment will stop that they start putting themselves at risk, can also be an issue, and he notes effort needs to be directed into improving the ability of trucks themselves to detect moisture. There have been incidents where wet roadways have caused them to lose traction.",
      "There can be legitimate safety concerns with autonomous equipment, says Shane Roulstone, co-ordinator for the Western Mine Workers Alliance, which represents mining-related workers in the Pilbara.",
      "He points to a serious incident this May where an autonomous train slammed into the back of a broken-down train, which workers at the front end were repairing (they evacuated before it hit but were left shaken).",
      "But Mr Roulstone also praises Rio generally for having, over time, developed \u201csome good strategies, procedures and policies\u201d around how people interact with automated vehicles.",
      "Mr Roulstone expects that at some point options for redeployment will lessen and there will job losses. \u201cIt is just the mathematics of it,\u201d he says.",
      "Meanwhile, Rio\u2019s automation journey in the Pilbara continues with more trucks, drills and Henry the water cart. It is also closely watching work by Komatsu and Caterpillar to develop un-staffed excavators, loaders and dozers.",
      "Late in the afternoon, waiting at Greater Nammuldi\u2019s airport for the last flight back to Perth, the announcement comes that it has been cancelled due to an issue with the plane. That\u2019s 150 extra people who will now need to be fed and accommodated. It is nothing for Rio, but I can\u2019t help but think we humans are complicated compared to robots.",

      "Scientists say this should act as an alarm call ahead of next week's UN climate conference in Azerbaijan, COP29.",
      "\"This latest record sends another stark warning to governments at COP29 of the urgent need for action to limit any further warming,\" says Liz Bentley, chief executive of the Royal Meteorological Society.",

      "Global temperatures have been so high through the first 10 months of 2024 that only an implausibly sharp drop in the final two months would prevent a new record from being set.",
      "In fact, it is likely that 2024 will end up at least 1.55C hotter than pre-industrial times, according to data from the European Copernicus Climate Change Service.",
      "\"Pre-industrial\" refers to the benchmark period of 1850-1900, which roughly equates to the time before humans started significantly heating up the planet, for example by burning large amounts of fossil fuels.",
      "The projection means that 2024 could surpass the current record of 1.48C, which was set only last year.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records,\" says Samantha Burgess, deputy director of Copernicus.",
      "This would also represent the first time that a calendar year has passed 1.5C of warming, according to Copernicus data.",
      "This would be symbolic, because almost 200 countries pledged to try to limit long-term temperature rises to that level under the Paris climate agreement in 2015, hoping to avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change.",
      "If the 1.5C limit is breached, that does not mean the Paris goal has been broken, because it refers to average temperatures over a period of 20 years or so, in order to smooth out natural variability.",
      "But every year-long breach brings the world closer to passing the 1.5C mark in the longer term. Last month, the UN warned that the world could warm by more than 3C this century based on current policies.",
      "The specifics of 2024 also offer cause for concern.",
      "Early 2024 warmth was boosted by the natural El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern. This is where surface waters in the east tropical Pacific Ocean are warmer than usual, which releases extra heat into the atmosphere.",
      "This latest El Ni\u00f1o phase began in mid-2023 and ended around April 2024, but temperatures have remained stubbornly high since.",
      "Over the past week, global average temperatures have set new records for the time of year every day, according to Copernicus data.",

      "Yellowstone fans feel a deep connection to Beth Dutton and Rip Wheeler, the couple at the heart of the show's success. As the series approaches its end, Kelly Reilly, who plays Beth, addressed speculation about their future during an appearance Friday on \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "When asked about a potential spin-off featuring Beth and Rip, Reilly responded with an enthusiastic, \"Yes, please.\" She added, however, that her focus remains on bringing Beth's story to a powerful close in the main series.",
      "Reilly's portrayal of Beth \u2014 the only daughter of patriarch\u00a0John Dutton, played by\u00a0Kevin Costner\u00a0\u2014has become iconic for her fierce loyalty, deep love and unpredictable nature. In season five, Beth is locked in a bitter conflict with her brother Jamie, whose manipulative schemes threaten to tear their family apart. Reilly said Beth's intensity comes from a painful past.",
      "\"She's not just one thing. She's like 10 women in one,\" Reilly said. \"There's an incredible depth of heart and love and devotion for her family.\"",
      "Despite Beth's wild behavior, Reilly says she feels a profound sympathy for her.",
      "\"She breaks my heart,\" Reilly said. \"I think over the years, over the seasons, you're able to sort of unpeel the layers and get to see why she does some of the things she does.\"",
      "Beth's difficult past includes growing up on a rugged ranch with her brothers and a tragic accident where a horse bucked, fell on her mother and killed her. Beth's mother blamed her for the incident before dying, a moment that scarred Beth.",
      "One of Beth's few sources of happiness is her relationship with Rip Wheeler, played by Cole Hauser. Their love story has resonated so deeply with fans that they even dress up as Beth and Rip for Halloween. Reilly described the relationship as deeply protective.",
      "\"They're both savages ... but they are so fiercely protective of one another,\" Reilly said.",
      "Reilly, who is British, also discussed her process of capturing Beth's American accent with the help of a dialect coach.",
      "\"It's not the first time I've played American...and I'm married to an American, I live in New York,\" she said.",

Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",

      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "In the case of Byron, NASCAR ruled that Ross Chastain and Austin Dillon both ran interference to help fellow Chevrolet driver Byron not lose any position on the track that would cost him a spot in the championship.",
      "Elton Sawyer, NASCAR's senior vice president of competition, said the sanctioning body considered suspending the drivers as well as taking action against manufacturers Chevrolet and Toyota. He said there was nothing in the rulebook that would call for the manufacturers to be punished, but NASCAR planned to meet with the leaders of Ford, Chevy and Toyota to discuss the situation.",
      "Because the penalties were issued the week of the season finale, the teams have until Wednesday afternoon to ask for an expedited appeal. The appeals would likely be heard Thursday.",

      "Dillon was fined $100,000, as was Richard Childress Racing. One-race suspensions were given to team executive Keith Rodden, crew chief Justin Alexander and spotter Brandon Benesch. The team also lost 50 points. Richard Childress Racing also said it would appeal.",
      "Wallace was fined $100,000, as was 23XI. The one-race suspensions went to team executive Dave Rogers, crew chief Robert Barker and spotter Freddie Kraft. The team also lost 50 points.",

      "But he said he hoped the penalties were harsh enough to curb the manufacturer alliances and race manipulation.",
      "\"We took and looked at the most recent penalty that we had written for an infraction very similar... we wanted to ramp this one up,\" Sawyer said, \"and we did. We did that in a way that included team leadership and this is something that we felt like we wanted to get our point across that it is a responsibility of all of us.... to uphold the integrity of the sport.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 04 Nov 2024 13:31:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music legend who collaborated with everyone from Michael Jackson to Frank Sinatra, has died at 91, his family announced.",
    "story": [
      "Quincy Jones, the multi-talented music titan whose vast legacy ranged from producing Michael Jackson's historic \"Thriller\" album to writing prize-winning film and television scores and collaborating with Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles and hundreds of other recording artists, has died at 91.",
      "Jones' publicist, Arnold Robinson, says he died Sunday night at his home in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, surrounded by his family.",
      "\"Tonight, with full but broken hearts, we must share the news of our father and brother Quincy Jones' passing,\" the family said in a statement. \"And although this is an incredible loss for our family, we celebrate the great life that he lived and know there will never be another like him.",
      "\"He is truly one of a kind and we will miss him dearly; we take comfort and immense pride in knowing that the love and joy, that were the essence of his being, was shared with the world through all that he created. Through his music and his boundless love, Quincy Jones' heart will beat for eternity.\"",
      "Jones rose from running with gangs on the South Side of Chicago to the very heights of show business, becoming one of the first Black executives to thrive in Hollywood and amassing an extraordinary music catalog that includes some of the richest moments of American rhythm and song.",
      "For years, it was unlikely to find a music lover who didn't own at least one record with his name on it or a leader in the entertainment industry and beyond who didn't have some connection to him.",
      "Jones kept company with presidents and foreign leaders, movie stars and musicians, philanthropists and business leaders. He toured with Count Basie and Lionel Hampton, arranged records for Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald, composed the soundtracks for \"Roots\" and \"In the Heat of the Night,\" organized President Bill Clinton's first inaugural celebration and oversaw the all-star recording of \"We Are the World,\" the 1985 charity record for famine relief in Africa.",
      "Lionel Richie, who co-wrote \"We Are the World\" and was among its featured singers, would call Jones \"the master orchestrator.\"",
      "Jones' work with Michael Jackson",
      "In a career that began when records were still played on vinyl at 78 RPM, the top honors he received are likely the ones for his productions with Jackson: \"Off the Wall,\" \"Thriller\" and \"Bad\" were albums near-universal in their style and appeal. Jones' versatility and imagination helped set off Jackson's explosive talent as he transformed from child star to the \"King of Pop.\" On such classic tracks as \"Billie Jean\" and \"Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,\" Jones and Jackson fashioned a global soundscape out of disco, funk, rock, pop, R&B and jazz and African chants. For \"Thriller,\" some of the most memorable touches originated with Jones, who recruited Eddie Van Halen for a guitar solo on the genre-fusing \"Beat It\" and brought in Vincent Price for a ghoulish voiceover on the title track.",
      "\"Thriller\" sold more than 20 million copies in 1983 alone and has contended with the Eagles' \"Greatest Hits 1971-1975\" among others as the best-selling album of all time.",
      "\"If an album doesn't do well, everyone says 'it was the producers fault'; so if it does well, it should be your 'fault,' too,\" Jones said in an interview with the Library of Congress in 2016. \"The tracks don't just all of a sudden appear. The producer has to have the skill, experience and ability to guide the vision to completion.\"",
      "The list of his honors and awards fills 18 pages in his 2001 autobiography \"Q\", including 27 Grammys at the time (now 28), an honorary Academy Award (now two) and an Emmy for \"Roots.\" He also received France's Legion d'Honneur, the Rudolph Valentino Award from the Republic of Italy and a Kennedy Center tribute for his contributions to American culture. He was the subject of a 1990 documentary, \"Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones\" and a 2018 film by daughter Rashida Jones. His memoir made him a best-selling author.",
      "Music as Jones' savior",
      "Born in Chicago in 1933, Jones would cite the hymns his mother sang around the house as the first music he could remember. But he looked back sadly on his childhood, once telling Oprah Winfrey that \"There are two kinds of people: those who have nurturing parents or caretakers, and those who don't. Nothing's in between.\" Jones' mother suffered from emotional problems and was eventually institutionalized, a loss that made the world seem \"senseless\" for Quincy. He spent much of his time in Chicago on the streets, with gangs, stealing and fighting.",
      "\"They nailed my hand to a fence with a switchblade, man,\" he told the AP in 2018, showing a scar from his childhood.",
      "Music saved him. As a boy, he learned that a Chicago neighbor owned a piano and he soon played it constantly himself. His father moved to Washington state when Quincy was 10 and his world changed at a neighborhood recreation center. Jones and some friends had broken into the kitchen and helped themselves to lemon meringue pie when Jones noticed a small room nearby with a stage. On the stage was a piano.",
      "\"I went up there, paused, stared, and then tinkled on it for a moment,\" he wrote in his autobiography. \"That's where I began to find peace. I was 11. I knew this was it for me. Forever.\"",
      "Within a few years, he was playing trumpet and befriending a young blind musician named Ray Charles, who became a lifelong friend. He was gifted enough to win a scholarship at the Berklee College of Music in Boston, but dropped out when Hampton invited him to tour with his band. Jones went on to work as a freelance composer, conductor, arranger and producer. As a teen, he backed Billie Holiday. By his mid-20s, he was touring with his own band.",
      "\"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving,\" Jones later told Musician magazine. \"That's when I discovered that there was music, and there was the music business. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two.\"",
      "Jones, the businessman",
      "As a music executive, he overcame racial barriers by becoming a vice president at Mercury Records in the early '60s. In 1971, he became the first Black musical director for the Academy Awards ceremony. The first movie he produced, \"The Color Purple,\" received 11 Oscar nominations in 1986 but, to his great disappointment, no wins.",
      "In a partnership with Time Warner, he created Quincy Jones Entertainment, which included the pop-culture magazine Vibe and Qwest Broadcasting. The company was sold for $270 million in 1999.",
      "\"My philosophy as a businessman has always come from the same roots as my personal credo: Take talented people on their own terms and treat them fairly and with respect, no matter who they are or where they come from,\" Jones wrote in his autobiography.",
      "Jones, the epitome of versatility",
      "He was at ease with virtually every form of American music, whether setting Sinatra's \"Fly Me to the Moon\" to a punchy, swinging rhythm and wistful flute or opening his production of Charles' soulful \"In the Heat of the Night\" with a lusty tenor sax solo. He worked with jazz giants (Dizzy Gillespie, Count Basie, Duke Ellington), rappers (Snoop Dogg, LL Cool J), crooners (Sinatra, Tony Bennett), pop singers (Lesley Gore) and rhythm and blues stars (Chaka Khan, rapper and singer Queen Latifah).",
      "On \"We are the World\" alone, performers included Michael Jackson, Bob Dylan, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen. He co-wrote hits for Jackson - \"P.Y.T (Pretty Young Thing)\" - and Donna Summer - \"Love Is in Control (Finger on the Trigger) - and had songs sampled by Tupac Shakur, Kanye West and other rappers. He even composed the theme song for the sitcom \"Sanford and Son.\"",

      "\"Our investigation continues and a file has now been passed to the CPS,\" said Detective Superintendent Andy Furphy, who is leading the investigation. \"We have a team of dedicated officers providing specialist support to the women who have come forward. We are committed to investigating sexual offenses, no matter how long ago they are alleged to have taken place.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 03 Nov 2024 10:11:23 -0500",
    "summary": "The former child actor who grew up to play Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child in \"Succession,\" is now playing a rudderless man-child in Jesse Eisenberg's poignant comedy, \"A Real Pain.\"",
    "story": [
      "For 42-year-old Kieran Culkin, visiting the building in Manhattan's Yorkville neighborhood where he spent the first eight years of his life brings back unusual memories. \"I remember my mom baking a cake and it would come out slanted because the whole apartment was on a slant,\" he said. \"We used to put cars on one end of the kitchen and let go and see them roll!",
      "\"We lived in a tight space where it was just seven of us running around. It was like a sort of little wolf-pack mentality,\" he said.",
      "His father \"Kit,\" himself a former actor, and mother Patricia, a telephone operator, raised their seven kids in a four-room apartment. Kieran came fourth in the birth order. \"Whenever the door would open to let the kids in, I used to stand aside and make sure, and I used to count to make sure all six of them got in before I got in,\" he said. \"That's how I remember growing up, too, was I couldn't fall asleep until they all fell asleep. Like, I only existed because they did around me.\"",
      "He got into acting because neighbors of theirs ran an off-off-Broadway theater on the Upper East Side: \"And they knew that there was this family that had a bunch of kids. And whenever they needed a kid they were like, 'Uhm, you know, we might need a kid for this show.' And my parents were more or less like, 'Okay, yeah, what gender? What age? We got a whole bunch.'\"",
      "Soon enough, Macaulay, two years older than Kieran, became world famous as the star of \"Home Alone.\" Kieran also had a small role in that movie, and a year later played Steve Martin's son in \"Father of the Bride.\"",
      "Kieran was cute and charismatic. But making it as a grownup actor meant learning how to act. He says when he was 18 and starring in the movie \"Igby Goes Down,\" the director, Burr Steers, wanted to break him of his \"kid acting habits\" \u2013 to unlearn the tricks that had served him so well as a child.",
      "\"He really didn't like kid actors, and he was like, 'You still have a few bad habits,'\" Culkin said. \"He was like, 'You're doing something with your eyes.' He would say, 'Soulful eyes.' Or sometimes he would say, you know, 'That was Nickelodeon,' or something like that. 'You're doing kid stuff.'\"",
      "And when that didn't work, \"He bought me a six-pack of beer and he goes, 'I want you to take this beer and do the scene in front of the mirror.' And I was like, 'I don't think I can do that \u2026 I'm gonna be too self-conscious.' He goes, 'That's what the beer's for.'\"",
      "Culkin got praise for \"Igby.\" But he wasn't sure he wanted to keep acting. For one thing, he was worried about becoming famous. \"Definitely. I feel like any rational person [who] got to experience fame second-hand, they would not pursue it. It's not a nice thing.\"",
      "His brother, Macauley, has become an international movie star at a young age. \"And I saw that and went, 'Oh, I got it. That's awful. Let's never do that!'\"",
      "Kieran worked on stage and only sporadically on film for years, before landing the part he's best known for: Roman Roy, the filterless, fast-talking middle child scheming to inherit a media empire in \"Succession.\"",
      "Even as a member of the fictional Roy family, though, Culkin's real family played a role. Back in 2008, his older sister, Dakota Culkin, was struck and killed by an automobile. He said, \"After a couple seasons on 'Succession,' I realized there was some stuff that Roman did that I was like, 'Oh, that's my sister. That was her sense of humor.' She could find exactly what the right thing to make fun of you was that would get to you, but be really funny and make the room laugh. That was her.\"",
      "Sixteen years later, the loss of his sister is still devastating. \"I only knew who I was because of who my siblings are,\" Kieran said. \"So, to lose one was losing a big piece of myself. Losing one of my favorite people in the world, it doesn't get easier. But you get used to it.\"",
      "Culkin's newest project is also about family. In the movie \"A Real Pain,\" he and Jesse Eisenberg (who wrote and directed) play cousins on a trip to Poland to see where their late beloved grandmother was raised \u2013 and the concentration camp she survived.",
      "Culkin's character, Benji, is a charming but rudderless man-child \u2026 a contrast to Eisenberg's straitlaced family man.",
      "Asked why he connected with the role, Culkin replied, \"I don't really know what it was with me, but I went, I instantly knew who this guy was. I understood the dynamic, and I really wanted to play.\"",
      "Describing the character, Culkin has said, \"I'm one quick little misstep away from being that person.\"",
      "\"That's good! I said that? Good!\" he laughed. \"I feel like I easily could've gone down that path. There was something in that that I recognized as myself, but I'm not that guy at all. But I think I'm worried that I easily could've become that guy, [had I not] married, kids, or figured out how to, you know, get my s*** together.\"",
      "Indeed, Culkin is not \"that guy.\" He's been married to his wife Jazz for 11 years. The couple has two children.",
      "Asked what he likes about being a dad, Culkin said, \"Oh, man, everything. Everything except dinnertime. Dinnertime's a terror. I've seen some kids sit and eat dinner, it's great. My kids sit and eat breakfast, they'll eat lunch, but dinner is just throwing things around the house, and it's very stressful.\"",
      "Kieran Culkin may be at the top of his game, but he says he's still figuring it out.",
      "\"There's different versions of success. I think for many years success, for me, was, like, working on projects I really like [that] nobody really sees. Fly under the radar, but keep getting to do what I do. And now I'm like, 'Well, now I gotta figure out how to do the jobs I want but also make money.' It's really hard to find the way to do that!\"",

    "summary": "Republicans' newly won control of the Senate may have buoyed Kennedy's odds of a role in the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that it would seek to pull a widely used ingredient in cough and cold medicines from the market, after the agency's scientists concluded that the oral version of the drug is ineffective as a nasal decongestant.",
      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",

      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

      "The latest data shows that only a tiny fraction of phenylephrine is absorbed into the body when digested from a pill or syrup containing phenylephrine. This is different from other formulations like the inhaled nasal spray versions of the drug, where larger percentages of the drug can make it into the bloodstream.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",
      "Without the ability to choose which company to work with, \"families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,\" the agency said, \"including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.\"",

      "When asked if he'd step down if Trump requested it, Powell responded with a one-word answer: \"No.\"",
      "Powell's insistence that he'll remain in his role comes after Trump aired grievances about the Fed's decision-making during his first presidency and, more recently, on the campaign trial. Trump, who has accused Powell of being \"political,\" also told Bloomberg Businessweek this summer he would let the economist serve out his term, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Yet Trump has also said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\"\u00a0Trump\u00a0said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",

      "Powell also noted that the election in the near-term will have no impact on the central bank's rate decisions, with the Fed instead relying on economic data for its decisions. For now, he added, it's not clear what policies or tax changes may emerge from a second Trump presidency.",
      "Many of Trump's proposals, such as tax cuts, must be passed by Congress before being signed into law by the president.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",

      "ICE is biggest customer",
      "During Trump's first term in office, from 2017-2021, immigration detention expanded at record levels, according to an ACLU report. In 2019, ICE detained an average of over 50,000 people each day. At times, that number exceeded 56,000 \u2014 about 50% more than peak levels during the Obama administration, according to the report. During his first term in office, Trump expanded the federal government's use of private prison companies to detain immigrants.",
      "As of January 2020, 81% of people detained in ICE custody across the U.S. were held in facilities owned or managed by private prison corporations, according to the ACLU report.",
      "In his second term, President-elect Trump promises a radical shift in policy at the U.S.-Mexico border from his predecessor. That includes a pledge to oversee the largest deportation operation in American history, which could bring significantly more business to CoreCivic and Geo Group.",
      "For the first nine months of 2024, ICE accounted for 30% of each company's revenue.",
      "Both Geo Group and CoreCivic said they currently have excess capacity to accommodate a larger population of detainees. CoreCivic executives noted that they're taking steps to prepare to activate additional capacity to meet ICE's needs. That could include reconfiguring facilities to accommodate a bigger intake area, they noted.",
      "\"There is room for an uptick in occupancy from a capacity standpoint and both companies expect an ask from the Trump administration for more beds. The question is how much, and we just don't know right now,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Brian Violino told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Monitoring",
      "Geo Group also provides monitoring services for ICE under its Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), a monitoring program using wearable technology that serves as an alternative to detention.",
      "\"If there is a finite number of beds and a significant number of people are detained, which Trump is discussing in his plans, there could be an increased usage in this alternative to detention,\" Violino said.",

      "Funding from Congress",
      "The degree to which ICE expands its contracts with the two largest private prison companies depends on how big of an increase in funding Congress authorizes. While Republicans won the Senate majority in Tuesday's election, it remains to be seen which party will obtain control of the U.S. House of Representatives.",
      "\"That's a big part of the story, and if it's a Republican sweep, it will be easier for Trump to get funding from Congress to support this operation he's looking to do,\" Violino said.",

      "Between finding openings, sending out your resume and interviewing, looking for a job is tough. Now a growing trend of\u00a0scammers\u00a0impersonating recruiters is making it even harder.",
      "In the last year, job scams have been on the rise, according to Eva Velasquez, president and CEO of the Identity Theft Resource Center, a nonprofit that helps consumers when their identities are compromised.",
      "Because most job seekers turn to online platforms for employment, scammers impersonate companies and recruiters to trick people into giving them money or personal information.",
      "\"We've really seen tremendous growth in job scams,\" Velasquez said. \"I think that's just due to the fact that we fundamentally changed the way we recruit and hire people.\"",
      "It happened to Tehseen Islam, a 28-year-old quality assurance analyst. She had been looking for a job for a few months when she finally got an offer from a well-known marketing technology company. Or at least she thought she did.",
      "After a weeklong process that included an online form with interview screening questions, Islam was offered the job and received a check. She was asked to deposit it and send the company $1,000 to pay for shipment of equipment she'd need for the job.",
      "A few days later, her bank notified her that the check had bounced and, because it looked like she was cooperating with scammers, it was ending all banking relationships with her. That's when she learned the job was a scam.",
      "\"I'm a little traumatized,\" said Islam, who lost the $1,000 and unknowingly shared personal information with scammers.",
      "If you're a job seeker, here are some recommendations from experts on how to avoid job scammers:",
      "Job scams are a type of\u00a0impersonation scam.",
      "Scammers tend to use the name of an employee from a large company and craft a job posting that matches similar positions. An initial red flag is that scammers usually try to make the job very appealing, Velasquez said.",
      "\"They're going to have very high salaries for somewhat low-skilled work,\" she said. \"And they're often saying it's a 100% remote position because that's so appealing to people.\"",
      "Some scammers post fake jobs, but others reach out directly to job seekers through direct messages or texts. If the scammers are looking to steal your personal information, they may ask you to fill out several forms that include information like your Social Security number and driver's license details.",
      "The only information a legitimate employer should ask for at the beginning of the process is your skills, your work experience, and your contact information, Velasquez said.",
      "Other details don't generally need to be shared with an employer until after you've gotten an offer.",
      "Whether you're replying to a job posting or a recruiter, you must research the company, especially if you didn't initiate the conversation, Velasquez said.",
      "Fake recruiters often contact job seekers through social media or text messages. If someone reaches out to you, verify their identity before responding to their message.",
      "Here are a few recommendations while you research the recruiter or the company:",
      "\u2014 Don't respond to the message right away.",
      "\u2014 Go online and research if the company has current job openings on its official website.",
      "\u2014 Research the name of the recruiter and check if the person has a verifiable social media presence.",
      "\u2014 If the company has a job opening on its website, apply directly through the website.",
      "If you receive a message from a recruiter, it's best to not respond unless you know that the source is reputable. Avoid clicking on any links sent to you, whether to apply for a position or to fill out a questionnaire.",
      "In Islam's case, the scammers sent her a form with interview screening questions where they asked for her personal information.",
      "A common tactic is for scammers to send you a fake signing bonus and then ask you to send some money back, supposedly to cover expenses. This is a way for scammers to steal money from job seekers, said Alvaro Puig, consumer education specialist at the Federal Trade Commission.",
      "\"If you deposit a check and it's fake, your account will show the money is there. But then days later, the bank will discover that it was a fake check,\" Puig said.",
      "So, if you take out money from your account and send it to the fake recruiter, the money will be coming from your bank account and it will be impossible to get back.",
      "When job hunting through platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed, Velasquez recommends being very cautious with job openings and recruiters you trust. While these platforms are reputable and many of their job postings are real, the companies cannot verify every single employment opportunity posted. This creates an opportunity for scammers to post fake job listings and trick people.",
      "\"Don't let platforms that you know are legitimate allow other people to borrow that trust,\" Velasquez said.",
      "After her experience with job scammers, Islam has been more careful with the job openings she trusts. Now, she has a list of steps she follows, including verifying a recruiter's email through a free email address validator, such as Emailable or Clearout, and calling the company directly.",
      "\"This is adding a lot more time to my job search now but I can't just blindly trust that this person is who they say they are,\" Islam said.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 13:41:27 -0500",
    "summary": "Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election is likely to have a major impact on the economy. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump's victory in the November 5 election highlights the frustrations of millions of voters, with many Americans noting in\u00a0exit polls on Tuesday that they're still hurting from the highest inflation in 40 years and dissatisfied with the nation's economic trajectory.",
      "Trump ran on a campaign that vowed to tackle those issues, pledging to end the \"inflation nightmare\"\u00a0and to bring prices down \"very quickly.\" He also offered a myriad of tax cuts to various groups, ranging from senior citizens to homeowners, as well as to finance some of those cuts through new tariffs on imports from China and other nations and to\u00a0deport millions of undocumented immigrants.",
      "In the aftermath of Trump's win, economists and policy experts are assessing how those policies might impact the economy as well as consumers' wallets. Already, Wall Street is predicting that his policies could boost corporate growth, sending the S&P 500 higher by as much as 2.2% on Wednesday.",
      "But some experts note Trump's plans may also boost inflation, potentially hurting consumers who are hoping for relief at the checkout counter.",
      "\"The devil will be in the details,\" Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at investment bank Raymond James, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"The Trump tax, trade, tariff and immigration agenda could have significant economic impacts and raise concerns about a second wave of inflation.\"",
      "However, compromises or alterations to his plans \"could mitigate the impact,\" Mills added.",
      "To be sure, whether Trump can respond to voters' most pressing economic issues isn't certain, especially if the House of Representatives flips to Democratic control, which could stymie his plans to extend tax cuts that were enacted in his 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA) as well as to enact other changes.",
      "Here are five ways Trump's policies could impact the economy and your money.",
      "Your money under Trump's tax plans",
      "The core of Trump's tax plan is to extend the provisions in the TCJA that are set to expire at the end of 2025. These include the law's lowered tax brackets and expanded standard deduction.",
      "Trump also wants to provide deeper tax cuts for some individuals and businesses, with his campaign proposing lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% from its current 21%. He's floated the idea of eliminating personal income taxes on many types of earnings, from tips to Social Security benefits, but has yet to offer details.",
      "Trump's combination of tariffs and tax cuts, would rank as the sixth-biggest tax cut since 1940, according to a recent Tax Foundation\u00a0analysis.",
      "If Trump is able to enact these tax code changes, personal income taxes would decline for all income groups. But the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model (That research assesses Trump's proposed tax cuts but doesn't include the impact of tariffs.)",
      "That means a middle-class family with earnings of about $80,000 a year would get a tax break of about $1,740 in 2026, the analysis found. Top-earning households, with incomes of more than $14 million, would see their taxes reduced by $376,910, according to Penn Wharton.",
      "What could happen with inflation?",
      "Consumers rank inflation as one of their biggest economic concerns, with many still feeling impact of soaring prices during the pandemic. Although the U.S. inflation rate has now fallen close to the Federal Reserve's 2% annual goal, many Americans still describe it as high because prices haven't come down; rather, prices are simply rising more slowly than they did during the pandemic.",
      "Economists have cautioned that Trump's plans could reignite inflation. That's because tariffs are essentially sales taxes paid by American consumers, rather than the countries that export goods to the U.S. On top of that, Trump's plan to deport millions of immigrants could also boost inflation as employers would likely face higher wages due to a labor crunch.",
      "\"Two main pillars of his policy proposals, tariffs and mass deportations, are likely to cause prices to rise as they will make it more difficult for businesses to produce goods,\" Jacob Channel, chief economist at LendingTree, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Trump's plan to levy a 10% tariff on all imports and 60% or more on Chinese goods shipped to the U.S. could add $1,700 a year in additional costs for a typical middle-class household, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Trump's plans could boost the inflation rate by as much 1 percentage point, bringing it to an annual rate of about 3.4% \u2014 above the Fed's 2% goal \u2014 according to Andrzej Skiba of RBC Global Asset Management.",
      "\"If you add 1% to next year's inflation numbers, we should say bye to rate cuts,\" Skiba said.",
      "Could the economy grow faster?",
      "The economy could initially grow slightly faster under Trump's plans to cut corporate taxes, but that impact could fade over time, especially due to the impact of deporting millions of immigrants, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Real GDP growth could be 0.3 percentage points higher in 2026 than if current economic policies continued, wrote Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, in a November 6 research note.",
      "But, he added, GDP growth could eventually fall to 0.6 percentage points lower in 2028 than earlier projections due to the impact of deportations and higher tariffs.",
      "Will housing become more affordable?",
      "Probably not, according to Bright MLS chief economist Lisa Sturtevant.",
      "First, if Trump's plans reignite inflation as some economists are forecasting, the Federal Reserve may not continue lowering its benchmark rate. Without further cuts in borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, mortgage rates aren't likely to fall, she added.",
      "Second, deporting millions of undocumented immigrants could impact the housing sector \u2014 which already faces a severe shortage of homes \u2014 because it relies on these workers to build new homes, Sturtevant said.",
      "\"His mass deportation proposal would have a chilling effect on the construction industry, shrinking the already constrained labor force and stalling badly needed new housing construction,\" she said. \"At the same time, proposed tariffs will increase building costs.\"",
      "Will Trump's policies help your 401(k)?",
      "Possibly, given that Trump's proposed corporate tax cuts and support for lighter regulations on businesses, if enacted, could bolster company profits and lift the stock market.",
      "On Wednesday, indices including the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average,\u00a0soared on Wall Street optimism for stronger corporate growth.",
      "\"Lower corporate taxes and/or deregulation of the energy and financial sectors under a Trump administration could provide additional support,\" Solita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas, UBS Global Wealth Management, said in an email.",
      "Other financial instruments could also get a boost, including cryptocurrencies, due to Trump's pledge to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the planet.\"",
      "At the same time, much of these forecasts depend on Trump pushing through changes to the tax code, regulations and other laws, Channel noted.",
      "\"Virtually all of these policies will be tough to implement, even with Republican control over the House, the Senate and the presidency,\" he said. \"With that in mind, we might not see much change at all in the broader economy.\"",
      "He added, \"Inaction from the next Trump administration could mean that the economy continues to chug along its current course.\"",

      "The FDA's proposal comes more than a year after the agency's outside advisers voted against continued use of the ingredient, called oral phenylephrine, citing concerns with the initial data used to support its approval and new data questioning its effectiveness.",
      "A number of common over-the-counter nasal decongestants have relied on phenylephrine alone or in combination with other ingredients for years, including some cold and cough versions of Advil, NyQuil, Sudafed, Robitussin, Tylenol and Theraflu.",
      "\"Based on our review of available data, and consistent with the advice of the advisory committee, we are taking this next step in the process to propose removing oral phenylephrine because it is not effective as a nasal decongestant,\" Dr. Patrizia Cavazzoni, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a news release.",
      "The agency's proposed order would remove oral phenylephrine from the \"monograph\" of ingredients that drugmakers are allowed to use in cough and cold medicines which are sold on store shelves without a prescription.",
      "The public has until May 7 next year to weigh in on the proposal. After that comment period, if the FDA decides to finalize its proposal to revoke oral phenylephrine's status as \"generally recognized as safe and effective,\" over-the-counter drugmakers would be forced to stop using the ingredient.",
      "\"The FDA would provide manufacturers with appropriate time to either reformulate drugs containing oral phenylephrine or remove such drugs from the market,\" the agency said in its release.",

    "summary": "Struggling families pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to CFPB report.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that students eligible for free or reduced-price school meals cannot be charged processing fees, also known as junk fees, beginning in 2027.",
      "School districts currently work with processing companies to offer cashless payment systems for families. But the companies can charge \"processing fees\" for each transaction. By law, students who are eligible for reduced price meals cannot be charged more than 30 cents for breakfast and 40 cents for lunch. With processing fees, however, families can end up paying 10 times that amount. Processing companies charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a recent report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, processing fees can arrive weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report.",
      "The new Agriculture Department's policy becomes effective starting in the 2027-2028 school year. With this rule, the USDA will lower costs for families with income under 185% of federal poverty guidelines, which equals $57,720 for a family of four.",
      "\"USDA and schools across America share the common goal of nourishing schoolchildren and giving them the fuel they need to learn, grow and thrive,\" said Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack in a statement Friday. \"While today's action to eliminate extra fees for lower-income households is a major step in the right direction, the most equitable path forward is to offer every child access to healthy school meals at no cost. We will continue to work with Congress to move toward that goal so all kids have the nutrition they need to reach their full potential.\"",
      "The decision by the USDA follows a CFPB report that found online school meal payments predominantly affect low-income families. School lunch fees collectively cost families upwards of $100 million each year, according to the report.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture has mandated that school districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome.",
      "\"It's just massively inconvenient,\" said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children.",
      "Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead.",
      "\"A dollar here and there, I expected,\" she said. \"But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower \u2014 as are the salaries \u2014 is a lot.\"",
      "Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day became a burden in both time and effort for two working parents. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free school lunches which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point.",
      "In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account.",
      "While payment companies maintain that school districts can negotiate fees and rates before they agree to contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures \"may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.\" Just three companies \u2014 MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect \u2014 dominate the market, according to the report.",

    "summary": "President-elect Donald Trump's vow to raise tariffs could have Americans paying more for goods, from toys to auto parts, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "As President-elect Donald Trump readies to return to the Oval Office, U.S. retailers that depend on foreign suppliers are prepared to pass along the cost of his proposed import tariffs to consumers, potentially leading to higher prices for a range of products.",
      "Americans stand to lose between $46 billion and $78 billion in spending power each year on products including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods due to the new tariffs, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released Monday.",
      "\"Retailers rely heavily on imported products and manufacturing components so that they can offer their customers a variety of products at affordable prices,\" NRF Vice President of Supply Chain and Customs Policy Jonathan Gold said\u00a0in a statement. \"A tariff is a tax paid by the U.S. importer, not a foreign country or the exporter. This tax ultimately comes out of consumers' pockets through higher prices.\"",

      "5 ways Trump's next presidency could affect the U.S. economy - and your money",
      "For example, a $40 toaster oven would retail for $48 to $52 after the tariffs, while a $50 pair of running shoes would jump to to $59 to $64, according to the industry trade group. A $2,000 mattress and box spring set would cost $2,128 to $2,190, the NRF said.",
      "During President-elect Trump's first term in office, his administration imposed tariffs of up to 25% on more than $360 billion in products from China. President Joe Biden's White House kept most of those tariffs and added more onto goods including Chinese electric cars and microchips.",
      "Now, Trump has said he plans to impose a 60% tax on goods from China and a 10% to 20% levy on all of the $3 trillion in foreign goods the U.S. imports annually. Such sweeping tariffs would reignite inflation, as they would mostly be paid by U.S. consumers, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has warned, offering a general view widely\u00a0shared by\u00a0other economists on both sides of the political aisle.",
      "\"A consistent theoretical and empirical finding in economics is that domestic consumers and domestic firms bear the burden of a tariff, not the foreign country,\" the nonpartisan Budget Lab at Yale University stated in an\u00a0analysis published in mid-October.",
      "Trump has repeatedly contended that foreign companies would foot the bill, telling a gathering last month at the Economic Club of Chicago that \"the countries will pay\" the tariffs. In reality, American importers pay the tariffs to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency when their goods cross the border.",
      "\"These policy steps would amount to regressive tax cuts, only partially paid for by regressive tax increases,\" and cost a typical middle-income household about $1,700 in increased taxes a year,\" according to economists at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The proposed tariffs would shift tax burdens from the well-off to lower-income Americans, the nonprofit also stated in a policy\u00a0brief\u00a0published in August.",
      "For now, it is unclear when the new Trump regime could seek to stiffen tariffs. The process to complete legislation required to raise the levies could take nearly a year, so any adverse impact might not be felt until 2026, according to Oxford Economics.",
      "Harvard University professor and former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers questioned the wisdom of taxing imports, noting the potential impact on prices. \"For parents, we're coming up on the holiday season and most of our toys are imported from China,\" Summers tweeted on Thanksgiving Day.",
      "Trump has argued that tariffs compel American companies to make goods on U.S. soil rather than purchasing from foreign suppliers.",
      "But some companies have other plans.",
      "\"If we get tariffs, we will pass those tariff costs back to the consumer,\" Philip Daniele, CEO of vehicle parts supplier AutoZone,\u00a0told\u00a0Wall Street analysts in an earnings call in late September. \"We'll generally raise prices ahead of \u2014 we know what the tariffs will be \u2014 we generally raise prices ahead of that,\" Daniele said.",
      "Major suppliers to AutoZone include companies based in China, India and Germany, according to the company.",
      "Stanley Black & Decker CEO Donald Allan Jr.\u00a0said\u00a0last week his tool-producing company has been planning for the possibility of additional tariffs on imports since the spring. \"Obviously, coming out of the gate, there would be price increases associated with tariffs that we [would] put into the market.\"",
      "Allan downplayed the idea of moving manufacturing back to the U.S., saying it would not be cost-effective. The company's options could include \"moving production and aspects of the supply chain to different parts of the world,\" including from China to other parts of Asia and possibly Mexico, the executive said.",
      "Such a shift has already been made by Shelton, Connecticut-based Acme United, which now has its Westcott brand products like rulers made in Thailand and the Philippines, avoiding the tariffs targeting China, CEO Walter Johnsen said in an October earnings call.",
      "Acme has switched production of certain medical products to India, Egypt and U.S. plants in Florida, North Carolina and Washington state, the executive said.",
      "Businesses have also stocked up, placing bigger-than-usual import orders ahead of new tariffs taking hold, as the U.S. imported 11% more Chinese products in July and August than they did during the same two-month period a year ago, according to the Census Bureau.",

      "The company's third-quarter results, disclosed in a U.S. Securities & Exchange filing, shows that the fledgling social media business continues to lose money, while its revenue slipped 5.6% compared with a year earlier. Still, that marks an improvement from the prior quarter, when Trump Media's sales tumbled 30%.",
      "Donald Trump's stake in DJT",
      "DJT stock has been on a rollercoaster since going public in March, with the shares surging or falling in line with news about Trump, its largest shareholder, with about 57% of the company's shares. The erratic fluctuations of the shares have prompted comparisons with so-called meme stocks, which trade on social media buzz rather than the fundamentals that investors prefer, such as revenue and profitability growth.",

    "story": [
      "If history is any guide, one stock market gauge suggests that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential race.",
      "In all but two elections since 1944, the party in the White House has retained power when the U.S. stock market advances before Election Day, or the period between the end of July and Halloween, according to an election predictor devised by Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research, based out of Allentown, Pennsylvania.",
      "In 2020, the S&P 500 fell 0.04% from July 31 to October 31, with then-President Donald Trump losing the election to President Joe Biden. While the outcome in the 2024 election is not yet known, the S&P 500 rose 3.3% during that three-month span this year.",
      "\"You can say there is sort of an overlap \u2014 the market usually goes up on an annual basis and voters tend to give the incumbent the benefit of the doubt, so it makes sense if the market goes up most of the time and the incumbent gets re-elected most of the time,\" Stovall told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even more reliable are periods when the stock market falls during the period from July 31 to October 31, in which case the incumbent has been replaced 89% of the time. That predictor failed only once, in 1956, according to Stovall, pointing to the year when incumbent President Dwight Eisenhower defeated Adlai Stevenson, despite the S&P 500 tumbling 7.7% in the period ahead of the election.",
      "Still, Stovall notes a mathematician might scoff at basing a model on such a limited sample, in this case the 21 presidential elections held in the U.S. since World War II.",
      "\"Is this really statistically significant? I think the answer is no, but it makes for interesting copy,\" the strategist said. \"You can have data tell whatever story you want.\"",

      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",

Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",

      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",

      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",

      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn is holding off on enforcing his ruling for 30 days to allow Illinois leaders time to appeal.",
    "story": [
      "CHICAGO (CBS) --\u00a0A federal judge in downstate Illinois has ruled the state's ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional, but will hold off on prohibiting the state from enforcing it for one month to allow for a likely appeal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn, who sits on the federal court in East Saint Louis, wrote in his 168-page opinion that the statewide ban on assault-style weapons violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The Protect Illinois Communities Act\u00a0bans the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requires existing owners of those weapons to register them with Illinois State Police.",
      "The legislation, signed into law in January 2023, banned dozens of specific brands or types of rifles and handguns, .50-caliber guns, attachments and rapid-firing devices. No rifle will be allowed to accommodate more than 10 rounds, with a 15-round limit for handguns.",
      "As part of his ruling that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, McGlynn issued a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ban, but he stayed that injunction for 30 days to give the state time to file an appeal.",
      "Gun control laws have come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the\u00a0Supreme Court's June 2022 decision\u00a0that imposed a new framework for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions. In that ruling, the court said that for firearms laws to comply with the Second Amendment, the government must identify historical analogues that show the measure is consistent with the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "McGlynn sided with plaintiffs who argued the Illinois assault weapons ban does not fit within the Supreme Court's framework, and who argued that assault weapons are commonly used for self-defense.",
      "\"What is particularly disturbing is that the prohibition of weapons that are commonly owned and used by citizens are now banned, depriving citizens of a principal means to defend themselves and their property in situations where a handgun or shotgun alone would not be the citizen's preferred arm,\" McGlynn wrote. \"Sadly, there are those who seek to usher in a sort of post-Constitution era where the citizens' individual rights are only as important as they are convenient to a ruling class.\"",
      "McGlynn compared the use of firearms for self-defense to equipping vehicles with airbags, ocean liners with lifeboats, or houses with storm shelters.",
      "\"Why do we protect ourselves with firearms? In life, we face many perils,\" He wrote. \"Too often, the perils we face are forced upon us by other people. By people who are negligent, reckless, insane, impaired, or evil. Sometimes it is the proverbial lone wolf; sometimes, it is the whole wolf pack. Truly, life comes at you quickly. And who comes to our aid in times of peril? Sometimes, it is the police or first responders; other times it is healthcare professionals; and sometimes it is family, friends, or neighbors. Sometimes, it is no one.\"",
      "Before the case went to trial earlier this year, McGlynn issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Illinois from enforcing the assault weapons ban, but a federal appeals court later reversed that decision. In July, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, sending it back to McGlynn for a trial, which was held in September.",
      "Meanwhile, a case against an assault weapons ban in Maryland has been upped to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court takes the Maryland case, it could take the Illinois case\u2014or send it back to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Two similar lawsuits are pending in federal court in Chicago.",
      "Gun rights and gun control advocates react",
      "Dan Eldridge was one of the plaintiffs who argued that assault-style weapons banned under Illinois law are commonly used for self-defense purposes.",
      "\"Illinois does not want to be the test case that shows all of these state so-called assault weapon bans are unconstitutional,\" said Dan Eldridge, president of Firearm Licensees of Illinois.",
      "Eldridge said the judge simply decided the Illinois law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\"This trial was on the merits of the case, and he found in our favor, and found that PICA's 'assault weapon' ban is unconstitutional under the 2nd and 14th amendments,\" he said.",
      "Rachel Jacoby of Highland Park was in Springfield on Jan. 10, 2023\u2014the day Gov. JB Pritzker signed the ban int law\u2014representing her community. It was July 4, 2022, when a man with a high-powered rifle opened fire on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park and killed seven people.",
      "\"This ruling is a slap in the face to every single person in Illinois who's been affected by gun violence, because those of us who have been personally affected by gun violence know the pain and trauma that comes from experiencing this,\" Jacoby said, \"and this judge's ruling is callous and unfounded in my opinion.\"",
      "Although the State of Illinois has already appealed the ruling, Eldridge said he hopes the plaintiffs are fortunate enough to win.",
      "\"And everything goes back to how it was on January 9 of 2023,\" Eldridge said.",
      "Jacoby hopes the ban stays in place, because regular people should not be able to access assault-style weapons.",
      "\"We know firsthand the devastation and trauma that these assault weapons can cause our communities, and we want to make sure that no other community has to experience that pain, that carnage, and that horror that we experienced,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said:",
      "\"The Protect Illinois Communities Act was the result of hundreds of hours of deliberation between legal experts, legislators, and advocates, and it makes Illinois a safer place for everyone. Despite those who value weapons of war more than public safety, this law was enacted to and has protected Illinoisans from the constant fear of being gunned down in places where they ought to feel secure. We look forward to the Attorney General filing an immediate appeal and the Governor is confident the constitutionality of the Protect Illinois Communities Act will be upheld through this process.\"",

      "When President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated in January, he'll assume the powers of the presidency with a surer sense of what he wants to accomplish and how to get it done, after four years on the job and four years planning his return.",
      "A Republican-controlled Senate likely puts his nominees on a glide path to confirmation, while the question of House control is still being determined.",
      "Here's what may be in store for Trump's second term, based on what he's said since he left office in 2021:",
      "Pardoning Jan. 6 rioters",
      "Trump has praised those who breached the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, as \"patriots\" and referred to them as \"hostages\" of a Justice Department \"weaponized\" against him. He has said that those who were arrested as a result of their actions during the Capitol riot should be freed, and he vowed to pardon a \"large portion\" of the more than 1,000 people who have been convicted of or pleaded guilty to crimes stemming from the Jan. 6 attack.",
      "Even before his election victory, defendants were trying to delay their cases, anticipating pardons. At least one defendant invoked Trump's win in an effort to delay proceedings in his case; lawyers for 21-year-old Christopher Carnell said in a filing the day after the election that Trump has \"made multiple clemency promises\" to Jan. 6 defendants and wrote that Carnell is \"expecting to be relieved of the criminal prosecution that he is currently facing when the new administration takes office.\"",
      "They said Carnell \"is now awaiting further information from the Office of the President-elect regarding the timing and expected scope of clemency actions relevant to his case.\" His request was swiftly denied.",
      "At a recent Trump rally in North Carolina, an attendee yelled at Trump to \"pardon the January sixers.\" Trump looked at the man and replied, \"Yeah, it's true.\"",
      "Firing special counsel Jack Smith",
      "Trump told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt recently that he'd fire special counsel Jack Smith, who has brought two federal criminal indictments against him, \"within two seconds\" of becoming president. Smith was appointed independent special counsel by Attorney General Merrick Garland to oversee Trump's federal criminal investigations and cases.",
      "Dispensing with criminal cases against him",
      "The Justice Department and special counsel Jack Smith's office are engaged in active discussions about how to wind down the ongoing federal prosecutions against President-elect Donald Trump, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "At the center of the discussions is the Justice Department's longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting president and the need to enable a smooth transition to a second term in the White House for Trump, the sources said.",
      "Experts told CBS News the Justice Department is likely to drop Trump's federal criminal cases. Smith charged Trump with four counts stemming from his conduct after the 2020 election, as he and others sought to overturn his defeat in that race.",
      "That case appeared to be heading for a spring 2024 trial before Trump's lawyers appealed a decision related to presidential immunity to the Supreme Court, which in July concluded former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official acts during their time in office.",
      "In a separate federal criminal case in Florida, Trump was accused of mishandling sensitive government records. The judge dismissed the case in July, ruling Smith had been unlawfully appointed special counsel by the attorney general. Smith has appealed the decision.",
      "If he had been convicted in the federal cases, he could have tried to pardon himself because the Constitution confers broad pardon power. But Trump can't pardon himself from his New York conviction in a case stemming from a \"hush money\" payment because that's a state offense. His sentencing date is set for Nov. 26, but it remains to be seen whether that will go forward.",
      "Trump could simply move to dismiss the cases against him, said Mark Tushnet, a constitutional law scholar at Harvard Law School.",
      "\"He won't have to pardon himself \u2014 as the chief executive and chief law enforcement office of the U.S. government, he can simply order that the prosecutions be dismissed,\" Tushnet said.",
      "In Fulton County, Georgia, Trump's 2020 election interference case has been delayed amid allegations of impropriety against the district attorney. That delay is likely to now be extended.",
      "Lead Trump attorney Steve Sadow told a judge in a hearing last December that proceedings would not be pushed off indefinitely if Trump won the presidency, suggesting 2029 is the year the trial could resume.",
      "Exerting more influence on the Federal Reserve",
      "Trump has given mixed responses on the future of the Federal Reserve chair he appointed in 2018, Jerome Powell. In February, Trump said he wouldn't reappoint Powell.",
      "But after Trump won this year's presidential election, Powell said he would not leave if asked to resign by Trump. Powell's term expires in 2026.",
      "In February, Trump said he had a \"couple of choices\" for Fed chair, but didn't say who those options might be.",
      "Trump has accused Powell of being \"political.\" However, in July, he told Bloomberg Businessweek, \"I would let him serve it out,\" Trump said, and he added, \"especially if I thought he was doing the right thing.\"",
      "Beyond the question of who would lead the Fed is a bigger issue: Trump has previously said he thinks the U.S. president should have more influence on Fed decisions \u2014 a risk to the central bank's historical independence from political meddling, according to experts.",
      "\"I feel the president should have at least a say in there. Yeah, I feel that strongly,\" Trump said in an Aug. 8 press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida. \"I think that, in my case, I made a lot of money, I was very successful, and I think I have a better instinct than, in many cases, people that would be on the Federal Reserve or the chairman.\"",
      "Trump will expect the Fed to support economic growth by continuing to ease borrowing costs for consumers and businesses while containing inflation. That amounts to a delicate balancing act, given some of the president-elect's key economic policies, like imposing stiff new tariffs, boosting federal spending and deporting undocumented immigrants, could lead to higher prices.",
      "Nominating new Supreme Court justices",
      "Supreme Court justices sometimes try to time their retirements with a presidential administration corresponding to the party of the president who appointed them. When Trump takes office, there will be three justices who were appointed by previous Republican presidents \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts, and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. Trump nominated the other three members of the conservative wing during his first term \u2014 Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.",
      "Thomas is the longest-serving member of the court, having been nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed by the Senate in 1991. Roberts and Alito were both tapped for the court by President George W. Bush in 2005 and 2006, respectively. Thomas, 76, and Alito, 74, are also the two oldest members of the Supreme Court.",
      "None of those three justices have publicly indicated an interest in leaving the Supreme Court.",
      "Trump's Supreme Court nominations during his first term widened the court's conservative majority from 6-3, and replacing any of the three other members would maintain that ideological split.",
      "Any nominations during Trump's second term would likely be of younger judges who could serve for decades, ensuring a conservative hold on the court for years to come. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh were in their 50s when he nominated them, and Barrett was 48.",
      "Trump told CBS News in August that he'd release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees ahead of the election, but that list never arrived.",
      "Deporting undocumented migrants en masse",
      "At his final campaign stop in Pennsylvania before Election Day, Trump again promised to start mass deportations, but acknowledged \"it's terrible to do.\"",
      "\"I don't want to do that. I'm not looking to do that,\" Trump said. \"I think it's terrible to do, but we have no choice.\"",
      "Nearly 80% of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. have been in the country a decade or more, and millions of them work and have families here. A concerted effort to round up, detain and deport people by the millions would not only raise legal and human rights concerns, it would cost billions of dollars a year.",
      "But Trump told NBC News after winning the election that there is \"no price tag.\"",
      "\"It's not a question of a price tag,\" he told NBC, adding, \"We have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag.\"",
      "Trump has said he may start with deporting undocumented migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and Aurora, Colorado \u2014 two communities targeted by his campaign rhetoric. He said in his debate with Harris that in Springfield, migrants were \"eating the dogs\" and cats, and said of Aurora that it was being overrun by Venezuelan gangs. Local and state officials of both parties disputed Trump's claims.",
      "Rolling back climate and clean energy policies",
      "Trump has long cast doubts on the threat of climate change and prioritized increasing U.S. oil and gas production. \"Drill, baby, drill\" became a refrain at campaign rallies. He has vowed to unlock new lands for drilling, expedite drilling permits and speed up approval of natural gas pipelines.",
      "Trump has also expressed desire to dismantle the Inflation Reduction Act and redistribute any unspent climate funds, which, among other things, support electric vehicle production, EV tax credits, and incentives for battery production and critical mineral mining.",
      "Such a move could prove unpopular with consumers, the automotive industry and even some members of his own party, who have recently supported certain programs funded by the IRA that have brought major manufacturing projects and jobs to conservative districts. Eliminating the individual tax credits for EV could be catastrophic for the automotive industry, which continues to see EV sales numbers grow, and many companies are basing production goals on these growing sales numbers. If the tax incentive is revoked, it would make EVs more expensive and harder to sell.",
      "One of Trump's most prominent backers, billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk, has benefitted from EV incentives.",
      "During his first term, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris Climate Agreement, which included national goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Mr. Biden later rejoined the accords.",
      "Trump's record on climate issues has prompted warnings from scientists and climate activists about the accelerating dangers of failing to move rapidly toward clean energy and more sustainable development. \"The science on climate change is unforgiving, with every year of delay locking in more costs and more irreversible changes,\" said Rachel Cleetus, the policy director and lead economist for the Climate and Energy Program at UCS.",
      "Climate advocates say four more years of Trump policies will mean the most robust action to fight climate change will need to be pursued at the state and local level, as well as by the business sector.",
      "Putting vaccine denier Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in charge of health care",
      "Kennedy's name has been floated to oversee a variety of health-related issues in a second Trump administration, including to run the Department of Health and Human Services. It's unclear, though, whether a nomination to a Cabinet position would receive the necessary support from Senate Republicans.",
      "Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, told CNN that the Senate will \"give great deference to a president that just won a stunning, what I think is an Electoral College landslide when all is said is done and a mandate.\"",
      "\"He's being given a mandate to govern, and I think presidents who are given a mandate to govern deserve from the Senate the opportunity to surround themselves with people who are going to execute their policies,\" Rubio said.",
      "Kennedy has spent years promoting false information and fears about vaccines, baselessly linking vaccines to autism long after such claims were disproven. He also falsely claimed COVID-19 was \"ethnically targeted\" to attack certain ethnic groups while sparing Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people \u2014 a conspiracy theory that drew accusations of antisemitism and racism. Kennedy also claimed Trump would push to remove fluoride from drinking water, a pet project of Kennedy's.",
      "Kennedy has said recently that he doesn't want to take vaccine options away from Americans, but his skepticism of them and conspiracy-laden views on science and medicine alarm public health experts.",
      "Kennedy has also campaigned against pesticide use in agriculture and processed food additives.",
      "During a rally in Henderson, Nevada, Trump suggested Kennedy would \"work on health and women's health,\" and said on election night that Kennedy is \"going to go make America healthy again.\"",
      "In an interview with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson last week, Trump said Kennedy \"can do whatever he wants,\" adding that he'd like the one-time independent presidential candidate to look at pesticides and vaccines.",
      "\"I want you to take care of the women of this country, the men of this country and the children of this country,\" he said.",
      "When NBC News recently asked Trump if \"banning certain vaccines\" might be on the table, Trump didn't dismiss the idea outright, saying he would make a decision and referred to Kennedy as a talented man with \"strong views.\"",
      "Cutting taxes and business regulations",
      "Trump has said he would boost economic growth through a combination of cutting taxes and eliminating regulations on business. Specifically, he is expected to push Congress to extend the sweeping tax cuts enacted under the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (TCJA), many of which are set to expire at the end of 2025.",
      "Trump has also proposed lowering corporate taxes to 15% from their current level of 21%; reversing a $10,000 deduction cap on state and local property taxes; ending taxes on tipped wages and overtime pay; and eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits.",
      "If Congress extends the TCJA cuts, income taxes would decline under Trump for Americans of all incomes, but the biggest beneficiaries would be high-income households, according to an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model.",
      "Overall, Trump's tax cuts would lower federal revenue by $5.8 trillion over the next 10 years, adding to the nation's mounting debt, Penn Wharton estimates. The national debt has grown significantly under both Trump and Mr. Biden in the last eight years.",
      "On the regulatory front, Trump has pledged to remove federal restrictions on fossil fuel production, eliminate red tape in housing construction and ease rules on cryptocurrencies, among other efforts. Investors expect such moves to drive up corporate profits and, in turn, stock prices.",
      "Imposing massive tariff hikes",
      "Trump has said he wants to impose tariffs on all international imports, which economists generally believe will lead to an increase in the price of goods.",
      "Trump pledged to impose 10% across-the-board levies on all products imported to the U.S. from overseas, something he says will protect American jobs and raise more federal revenue, which suggests that he believes that high tariffs would force companies to bring production back to the U.S., creating American jobs, and therefore more taxable revenue.",
      "But most economists say that would likely backfire. Manufacturers would pass costs on to consumers, effectively creating\u00a0 a new tax on Americans. Trump also proposed a levy of 60% or more on Chinese imports \u2014 so, in total, if these tariffs were enacted, a typical middle-class household\u00a0 would face an estimated $1,700 a year in additional costs, according to the non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people",
      "Trump has been inconsistent on questions surrounding LGBTQ rights, but during his first term, he rolled back protections for LGBTQ people \u2014 especially transgender individuals \u2014 and anti-trans rhetoric became a theme of his 2024 campaign. His campaign spent tens of millions on one such high-visibility ad that ran during the World Series, NFL and college football games with the memorable tagline \"\"Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.\"",
      "The Trump administration reversed a policy that required schools to allow transgender students to use bathrooms that correspond with their gender identity. His administration banned some transgender people from serving in the military \u2014 a policy that Mr. Biden reversed. And he also tried to repeal health protections for transgender people and sought to end protections for transgender individuals in federal prison, among other policies.",
      "During his campaign, Trump pledged to use his second term to punish doctors who provide gender affirming care for minors and impose consequences for teachers who discuss it with their minor students.",
      "Leaving abortion access to be decided by states",
      "The president-elect's stances on abortion\u00a0have been contradictory in the years since he began running for the presidency. He's touted the Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning a constitutional right to abortion in Roe v. Wade, taking credit for appointing three of the justices who joined the majority ruling.",
      "He frequently says the issue should be left up to the states \u2014 some of which have imposed near-total abortion bans. Trump has also pledged not to sign a national abortion ban.",
      "\"My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint, the states will determine by vote or legislation, or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,\" Trump said in April.",
      "At the presidential debate with Harris, Trump said, \"I'm not signing a ban,\" adding that there's \"no reason to sign a ban because we've gotten what everybody wanted.\" In October, he went further, saying he'd veto a national abortion ban.",
      "Anti-abortion advocates have called for further restrictions on abortion through a law already on the books. They believe the Comstock Act, which concerns the the shipping of materials deemed as \"obscene, lewd, lascivious, indecent, filthy or vile,\" could be applied to ban anything used to aid an abortion \u2014 not just the mailing of abortion pills. Trump told CBS News in August that he would not enforce the Comstock Act.",
      "On IVF, another reproductive rights issue that has come to the fore in recent months, Trump has pledged to expand access to the expensive fertility treatments. The pledge came in response to backlash following a ruling by the Alabama Supreme Court that determined that frozen embryos created during the IVF process could be considered children, raising the possibility of infanticide prosecutions if they're destroyed. This prompted clinics in the state to temporarily halt treatments. Democrats have warned that Republicans want to restrict access to the procedures, while blaming the Alabama ruling and threats to fertility treatments in other states on Trump.",
      "Trump announced last month a new plan that would require the federal government to pay for the fertility treatments or require insurance companies to cover costs associated with IVF. He has not said how the government would pay for the high cost of IVF, and the idea of an insurance mandate for IVF treatments runs counter to one of the main pursuits of his first term, the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. He did succeed in killing the law's individual mandate through the enactment of his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "Changing U.S. policy on Israel's war with Hamas and Hezbollah",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was among the first foreign leaders to hail Trump's victory.",
      "\"Your historic return to the White House offers a new beginning for America and a powerful recommitment to the great alliance between Israel and America,\" Netanyahu said in a tweet even before Trump's election win was confirmed.",
      "Netanyahu spoke to Trump in a \"warm and cordial\" phone call, his spokesperson said, adding that the two men \"agreed to work together for Israel's security\" and also discussed \"the Iranian threat.\"",
      "Trump has not said how he'll address Israel's still-expanding wars against Iran-backed Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in Lebanon, but he's suggested he can end the conflagration in the heart of the Middle East quickly.",
      "Netanyahu, under intense domestic and international pressure over his handling of the multi-front war, has relied heavily on Washington, Israel's closest ally, for military and diplomatic backing to continue the fight. He will be urging Trump to keep that vital support coming amid intense international pressure over the humanitarian crises in Gaza and Lebanon, and growing domestic pressure over his handling of the war.",
      "But veteran Israeli diplomat, government adviser and now journalist Alon Pinkas told CBS News ahead of the U.S. election that in his view, Trump is a \"very transactional man\" who fails to understand the complexities of the wars Israel is fighting and the motivation behind them.",
      "\"He's war averse,\" Pinkas said of Trump, adding that the president-elect's isolationist tendencies presented \"a great risk\" for Israel.",
      "Even if Trump were to decide to back away from active support for Israel and essentially let Netanyahu do as he sees fit, without criticism or threats of suspending aid, Pinkas said that wouldn't be enough to ensure Israel's security.",
      "\"If you look at the last six months, about American involvement in intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles in April, in deploying a THAAD missile system in Israel just three weeks ago, in deterring Iran to the best of their ability and providing Israel hardware and munitions that otherwise Israel may not have received,\" said Pinkas, \"it's not enough that they write, the Congress\u2026a blank check of $3.8 billion, which is the annual military aid, and say, 'leave us alone, do with it what you want.' There needs to be active American diplomacy.\"",
      "Pressuring Ukraine to cede ground to Russia to end war",
      "Trump will take over as the U.S. commander-in-chief amid the deadliest conflict on the European continent since World War II. He's said he can end the nearly three-year war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine before he even takes office.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he had an \"excellent\" conversation with Trump after the election, adding that they had agreed to \"advance\" cooperation.",
      "But on the campaign trail, Trump never said how he would end the war, and Ukrainians have voiced fear for months that he could do so by curbing the U.S. military and financial support \u2014 already worth more than $50 billion \u2014 which has been a lifeline for the country's defense, and force Zelenskyy to meet Russia's demands to cede occupied territory.",
      "Any fresh attempt to end violence like this is likely to involve peace talks of some kind, but Russian President Vladimir Putin has said repeatedly that the war will not end until the areas his forces have unilaterally and illegally annexed \u2014 around a fifth of Ukraine's territory \u2014 are recognized as part of Russia.",
      "Zelenskyy insists that all of Ukraine's land must be returned, and he's warned repeatedly that allowing Putin to seize ground will embolden the Russian leader, with direct implications for America.",
      "\"This aggression, and Putin's army, can come to Europe, and then the citizens of the United States, the soldiers of the United States, will have to protect Europe because they're the NATO members,\" Zelenskyy told CBS News early this year.",
      "Heaping pressure on NATO allies to cough up more cash",
      "There is clear precedent for Trump's stance on the U.S.-led NATO alliance that was born out of the military partnerships formed during World War II. During his first term and since, Trump has made it clear that he feels America's European NATO allies slipped into complacency, relying on their superpower partner for theoretical defense in what had been decades of peacetime.",
      "He demanded publicly, repeatedly that some of America's oldest and closest allies meet their NATO membership commitment to devote at least 2% of their annual GDP to their defense budgets. Trump accused some allies of freeloading - benefitting from the guarantee of NATO's collective defense principle without paying their fair share.",
      "While the European jitters over the Ukraine war are undoubtedly a factor, his reprimands seem to have worked, to some degree. The majority of NATO member states now meet at least the 2% threshold. It's little wonder, perhaps, that the only two countries that devote more than the U.S. to defense, proportionally, are Poland, which borders Ukraine, and Estonia, which borders Russia.",
      "There are still wider concerns, meanwhile, among NATO partners over the level of Trump's commitment to the alliance, and he vowed on the campaign trail to \"fundamentally reevaluate NATO's purpose and mission.\"",

    "summary": "It's the first time Trump has topped an opponent in the popular vote\u200b, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so.",
    "story": [
      "While the 2024 presidential election was among the closest in recent memory \u2014 with President-elect Donald Trump ahead by about 3 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 Trump's vote share grew in a diverse array of regions across the country and across different demographic groups.",
      "It's the first time in Trump's three campaigns for the White House that he's topped his opponent in the popular vote, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won almost 66 million votes (48%), compared to Trump's nearly 63 million (46%), but Trump won the Electoral College. In 2020, he lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to President Biden, who received about 81 million votes (51%) nationwide, compared to Trump's 74 million (47%).",
      "Trump's victory in 2024 was driven by improvements in support in a vast majority of counties nationwide \u2014 more than 9 in 10 \u2014 according to data from counties where at least 95% of votes have been counted as of Friday. Trump's improvements crossed regions, and included urban, suburban and rural gains.",
      "Trump even fared better in most places where a majority of voters preferred Harris, like New Jersey, or across the Hudson River, in his hometown of New York City.",
      "The Garden State, a longtime Democratic stronghold, swung markedly in Trump's favor. For instance, the latest data show Trump with a slim 3% lead in suburban Passaic County, where he got just 41% of the vote in 2020.",
      "In New York City, where Trump grew up and spent most of his life before entering politics, he didn't just surpass his two previous results; his roughly 30% vote share topped every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan, 40 years ago.",
      "Nearly 2,000 miles away, Maverick County, Texas, a majority Latino border county that Biden carried easily in 2020, swung even more, about 28 points. Trump in 2024 outperformed Biden's 2020 showing, and Harris fared worse than Trump did in 2020.",
      "CBS News exit polls from the last two elections showed Trump gaining among both men and women this year. In 2020, Trump won men by a hair, 49% to 48%, but in 2024, his campaign's efforts to woo men appear to have paid off: his support from men grew to 55%.",
      "In 2020, Trump managed to win 43% of women voters. In 2024, despite Democrats' focus on women voters and abortion access, which boosted them in the midterm election races, Trump still increased his numbers with women, notching up that figure two ticks, to 45%.",
      "Trump made gains among core groups within the traditional Republican coalition, such as evangelical voters. But he also increased his support among groups Democrats have relied on, including young voters and Latino voters, such as those in Maverick County and another former Democratic stronghold, Florida's Miami-Dade, which Mr. Biden won in 2020, with 53%. This year, Trump carried the county with about 55% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to win there since 1988.",

      "But any changes in the composition of the nation's highest court are unlikely in the coming months, even as lawmakers return for a lame-duck session to finish their business before Trump is sworn in for a second term and the GOP assumes the Senate majority.",
      "Sotomayor hasn't responded publicly to the chatter about a retirement, and she did not return a request for comment about her future. She remains an active questioner during oral arguments and has become known for biting dissents in hotly contested cases.",
      "At 70, she is not the oldest member of the Supreme Court \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas is 76 and Justice Samuel Alito is 74 \u2014 and she is newly into her tenure as the senior-most member of its liberal wing, a position she assumed following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer in 2022.",
      "Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, is also a decade younger than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she faced pressure to step down from the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2014.",
      "Ginsburg, who was treated for early-stage colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009, rejected any suggestion that she retire to allow then-President Barack Obama to name a successor while Democrats had control of the Senate. She remained on the Supreme Court until her death in September 2020, after which Trump, nearing the end of his first term, selected Justice Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. Barrett's confirmation by the GOP-led Senate widened the Supreme Court's conservative majority to 6-3.",
      "With a second term for Trump on the horizon, and Democrats losing control of the Senate come January, when Republicans will hold at least 52 seats, progressives are fearful of a repeat of what happened with Ginsburg's seat.",
      "\"We have no idea how long it will be until somebody who shares Justice Sotomayor's jurisprudence, her values will be in a position to be nominated again,\" Molly Coleman, executive director of the People's Parity Project, a progressive judicial group, told CBS News. \"Of course we all want to hope for the best, but unfortunately we've been left in a position where that's all we can do.\"",
      "The circumstances of more than a decade ago are different from today, making it far from a sure thing that even if Sotomayor were to retire, the Senate would confirm her replacement before the GOP takes over. For one, Democrats currently have a narrow 51-49 majority, which includes the four independent senators who vote with the party.",
      "One of those senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told Politico in March that he would not support nominees who do not have GOP support.",
      "\"Just one Republican. That's all I'm asking for. Give me something bipartisan. This is my own little filibuster. If they can't get one Republican, I vote for none. I've told [Democrats] that. I said, 'I'm sick and tired of it, I can't take it anymore,'\" Manchin, who is retiring from the Senate, said.",
      "He later appeared to slightly reverse course, voting in September to advance the nomination of a candidate for a federal appeals court. A spokesperson for the senator told Axios at the time that Manchin learned opposition to the nominee was based on how the White House handled the process, not qualifications.",
      "Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California Berkeley Law School, said there is not enough time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate by early January. Incoming House and Senate members will be sworn in on Jan. 3, and the results of the election will be reaffirmed by Congress on Jan. 6.",
      "\"Joe Manchin made clear he would not vote for any nominee without Republican support and no Republican would vote for a Biden nominee to replace Sotomayor. Sotomayor retiring now would likely just give Trump a vacancy to fill. It is totally different from whether Ginsburg should have retired in summer 2014 before the election,\" he told CBS News in an email.",
      "Chemerinsky wrote in September 2014 that Ginsburg should have retired that summer and warned her decision not to \"could end up hurting her legal legacy.\" Democrats had control of the Senate at that time, but lost it following the November 2014 midterm elections.",
      "Even some progressive groups that called for open discussions about Sotomayor's future on the court months ago are recognizing that the window has closed.",
      "\"The reality is it's too late. It's too late for Democrats to be having this conversation. It's too late to be launching a pressure campaign. The ship has sailed,\" Coleman, of the People's Parity Project said.",
      "She said discussions should have happened earlier this year and warned the consequences of waiting may be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "Instead, liberal judicial advocacy groups are turning their focus to the confirming Mr. Biden's remaining nominees to the federal district and appeals courts. There are currently 47 open seats on the federal bench, and 17 nominees are awaiting Senate action. There will be another 20 vacancies in the coming weeks, and 11 nominees are pending for those seats.",
      "\"Hand wringing about the unknown doesn't help anyone right now,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of the judicial group Demand Justice. \"Right now, we are firmly focused on the fact that there are still 30 pending Biden nominees before the Senate that deserve, and need, confirmation. The Senate should be focused on working late, working weekends to get these talented individuals on the bench.\"",
      "Trump saw immense success with judicial confirmations during his first term, appointing 234 jurists to the Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is closing in on that number, with 213 appointments so far.",

He also called for an investigation from \"the appropriate authorities\" into \"market manipulators or short sellers,\" whom executives at the company and shareholders have previously blamed for volatility in the stock, which trades under the ticker symbol DJT.",
      "DJT shares jumped shortly after Trump's post, gaining as much as 16% on Friday. The stock rose $3.15, or 11.4%, to $30.84 in early afternoon trading, partly reversing a 23% plunge on Thursday that had trimmed some of the company's gains in the run-up to the November 5 election.",
      "Trump, who is the biggest shareholder of Trump Media with a 57% stake, said the business has been the target of \"probably illegal rumors and/or statements\" that he said allege he plans to sell shares of the company, which owns the Truth Social platform. In September, Trump had vowed not to sell his stake after a lock-up period expired for Trump Media insiders, allowing them to sell for the first time since the stock went public in March.",
      "Trump Media, whose DJT ticker is the same as Trump's initials, has seen extreme volatility on Nasdaq, with its shares swinging wildly on news related to the president-elect. That has prompted comparisons of DJT with meme stocks, or companies that trade on social media buzz rather than financial fundamentals such as revenue and profit growth.",
      "Trump's call for an investigation into trading of the stock highlight potential conflicts of interest between his role as the nation's chief executive and his business interests, with his holdings in the company valued at $3.6 billion as of Friday afternoon. As president, Trump will not only have oversight of many federal agencies, but will also appoint the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that regulates the securities industry.",
      "Although there's no requirement that presidents sell their financial assets when they take office, most U.S. presidents have opted to put their business holdings into a blind trust,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan law and policy institute. A blind trust is managed by an independent trustee, and the president or other official who created the trust isn't allowed to advise or consult with the trustee on business decisions.",
      "During Trump's first term as president, he chose not to place his company, the Trump Organization, into a blind trust, opting instead to\u00a0hand over management\u00a0of the company to his oldest two sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, along with its longtime chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg was\u00a0released from jail\u00a0in July after pleading guilty to giving false testimony about the size of Trump's triplex apartment as part of a civil fraud trial.)",
      "Trump's arrangement during his first administration was flagged by some ethics experts as problematic, with former chief White House ethics lawyer Norm Eisen\u00a0writing\u00a0in 2017 that it failed to resolve the conflicts of interest between Trump's business holdings and his role as president.",

That drew\u00a0accusations\u00a0from Trump Media CEO Devin Nunes, a former Republican congressman, that these investors have manipulated the stock. Nunes has requested investigations by lawmakers and the Nasdaq stock market, where DJT is listed.",

    "story": [
      "An operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" President-elect Donald Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
      "Prosecutors say Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump last month. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the presidential election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" charging documents revealed.",
      "Shakeri and two individuals living in the U.S. \u2014 Carlisle Rivera of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt of Staten Island \u2014 were charged as part of a broad Iran-backed scheme to allegedly surveille and ultimately assassinate individuals inside the U.S. who opposed the Iranian regime.",
      "FBI investigators wrote that Shakeri immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Iran, but was deported in 2008 after serving more than a decade in prison on robbery charges. They alleged the IRGC ultimately used Shakeri to recruit criminal contacts inside the U.S. to carry out specific operations like targeting an unnamed Iranian American journalist and activist living in New York.",
      "In February, prosecutors alleged Shakeri paid Rivera and Loadholt about $1,000 to monitor the activist \u2014 who has spoken out against Iran's regime \u2014 at an event at Fairfield University in Connecticut. The surveillance operations continued into March, according to court documents, when the pair allegedly traveled multiple times to the activist's Brooklyn home. Text messages, security camera footage and cell site location data revealed their numerous trips.",
      "\"On or about April 1, 2024, 9 SHAKERI and RIVERA exchanged voice notes discussing RIVERA and LOADHOLT' s efforts to locate and murder\" the Iranian American, court records said.",
      "\"This b**** is hard to catch, bro,\" Rivera allegedly said to Shakeri. \"There ain't gonna be no simple pull up, unless there['s] the luck of the draw.\"",
      "According to court records, Shakeri allegedly responded later, \"you just gotta have patience and don't, kicking, kick in the door is not an option because that's a fail, that's a fail maneuver. You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don't think about going in. In is a suicide move.\"",
      "Investigators searched online accounts belonging to Rivera and Loadholt in the course of the federal probe and uncovered numerous images of firearms and other weapons.",
      "In April, Shakeri agreed to pay Rivera and Loadholt $100,000 to \"finish the work\" and said he was tasked by the IRGC to hire individuals to assassinate the journalist. And by July, according to charging documents, the Iranians were growing impatient, instructing their U.S. assets to \"take care of it already.\"",
      "The alleged plot to kill the activist did not succeed.",
      "Rivera and Loadholt are not accused of being part of the plot to target Trump. They made their initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and were ordered detained, according to the Justice Department. Shakeri remains at large.",
      "\"We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",
      "The charges announced Friday are not the first brought against alleged operatives of the IRGC for plotting to kill Trump. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Asif Merchant for planning to assassinate U.S. government officials, including potentially the president-elect. Merchant remains in custody and pleaded not guilty.",
      "On at least five occasions between September and November, Shakeri participated in \"voluntary telephonic interviews with FBI agents\" in exchange for a sentence reduction for another individual serving time in the U.S, court records said.",
      "During the interviews, he allegedly told the FBI of the IRGC's desire to kill the Iranian American activist and target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka with a mass shooting event. Shakeri also told investigators that the IRGC tasked him with surveilling two Jewish American citizens living in New York, but he did not provide the Iranian officials with information about the unnamed targets.",
      "During the interview, Shakeri also allegedly told the FBI about the effort to target Trump.",
      "In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won't be tolerated.\"",
      "The charges and allegations announced Friday are part of broader posture by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement to publicly bring attention to Iran's alleged efforts to quiet dissidents on U.S. soil and target U.S. government figures after the killing of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani by American forces in 2020. Trump and former members of his administration have been forced in recent years to increase his security due to the threats.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Biden administration program that would allow unauthorized immigrants married to American citizens to get legal status and a streamlined path to U.S. citizenship, declaring the policy illegal.",
      "U.S. District Court Judge J. Campbell Barker, an appointee of President-elect Donald Trump, found the program violates U.S. immigration law, agreeing with a lawsuit filed by Texas and more than a dozen other Republican-led states.",
      "The ruling is a major defeat for the outgoing Biden administration, which argued the policy, known as Keeping Families Together, promoted family unity among mixed-status households. When it was announced earlier this year, officials said roughly half-a-million undocumented immigrants were likely eligible for the program.",
      "The Justice Department can appeal Thursday's ruling, but the Keeping Families Together program is likely to be in the crosshairs of the incoming administration of Trump, who has vowed to dismantle President Biden's immigration policies. Trump has separately promised to seal and militarize the U.S.-Mexico border and oversee the largest mass deportation in American history.",
      "\"We strongly disagree with yesterday's ruling and we are evaluating next steps,\" White House spokesperson Angelo Fern\u00e1ndez Hern\u00e1ndez said in a statement Friday. \"This ruling sides with Republican state officials who are seeking to force U.S. citizens and their families, people who have lived in the United States for more than ten years, to either separate or live in the shadows in constant fear of deportation. As the President has said, America is not a country that tears families apart.\"",
      "The Keeping Families Together initiative was announced by Mr. Biden in June, just weeks after he took a different executive action to sharply limit asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border.",
      "The program would give work permits and deportation protections to undocumented immigrants who are married to American citizens and have lived in the U.S. for at least 10 years without committing serious crimes.",
      "Most importantly, the policy would also allow these immigrants to apply for permanent residency, also known as a green card. After three years, green card holders married to U.S. citizens can apply for citizenship.",
      "Immigrants who marry U.S. citizens are already eligible for a green card on paper. American immigration law, however, requires those who entered the U.S. illegally to leave the country and re-enter legally to be eligible for a green card. But leaving the U.S. after living in the country unlawfully for some time can trigger a 3 or 10-year exile, prompting many families to refrain from pursuing that option.",
      "The Biden administration's program would allow eligible immigrants to apply for a green card without having to leave the country by granting them an immigration benefit known as parole, which effectively cancels out their illegal entry.",
      "In his ruling, Campbell Barker said the Biden administration did not have the legal authority to grant parole to unauthorized immigrants who are already in the U.S.",

Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again. It is a well deserved honor to have Susie as the first-ever female chief of staff in United States history. I have no doubt that she will make our country proud.\"",
      "Wiles is known as a formidable political operative who prefers to work behind the scenes, rather than on camera. Trump asked her to come to the microphone when he declared victory early Wednesday morning, but she declined, preferring to stay out of the spotlight.",
      "Wiles has managed to not just curry but, more critically, keep Trump's favor while working in a high-profile campaign role, managing the ambitions, personalities and egos in Trump's orbit.",

      "\"Setbacks are unavoidable, but giving up is unforgivable,\" President Biden said. \"A defeat does not mean we are defeated.\"",
      "He urged Americans to embrace unity, and said he accepted the results of the election.",
      "\"We accept the choice the country made,\" he said. \"I've said many times, you can't love your country only when you win. You can't love your neighbor only when you agree,\" and he called for unity after the bitterly partisan election.",

      "He said he'd direct his administration to work with the president-elect's team for a \"peaceful and orderly transition\" of power.",
      "\"For over 200 years, America has carried on the greatest experiment in self-government in the history of the world,\" the president said in an address in the White House Rose Garden, continuing, \"where the people, the people vote and choose their own leaders and they do it peacefully. And where in a democracy, the will of the people always prevails.\"",

She gave her whole heart and effort, and she and her entire team should be proud of the campaign they ran.\"",
      "It was only four months ago that Mr. Biden was seeking reelection himself, before exiting the race and passing the baton to Harris. Now, he'll be handing off to Trump.",
      "The president also said he hopes this election quiets doubts about the integrity of the election and election workers, a reference to misinformation spread by Trump and Republicans about the 2020 election.",
      "\"I also hope we can lay to rest the question about the integrity of the American electoral system \u2014 it is honest, it is fair, and it is transparent,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And it can be trusted, win or lose.\"",

      "Trump ally and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani got a tongue-lashing Thursday in federal court after missing a deadline to turn over valuables to two election workers he defamed, including one asset, a vintage Mercedes, that he took for a drive to vote in Florida. He owes the women, Ruby Freeman and daughter Wandrea Moss, millions in damages.",
      "U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman, upon being informed that Giuliani is the only person named on a list of people who have knowledge of Giuliani's assets \u2014 and that he wants his name removed \u2014 called the request \"farcical.\"",
      "\"My expectation is you're going to answer that question truthfully and fully,\" Liman said, adding that someone else \"in the world\" must have knowledge of Giuliani's various assets.",
      "Hearings in the matter were being conducted remotely, but Liman ordered Giuliani to appear Thursday in person after learning that Giuliani had not met his obligations to the two women. Lawyers for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea Moss, said they went to Giuliani's Manhattan apartment last week and discovered that it had been emptied out, frustrating their efforts to catalog and obtain his assets.",
      "\"That's the one piece of property sitting here in Manhattan that can't be moved. Everything else has been game playing,\" said Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss.",
      "\"We've asked over and over where this stuff is, and the defendant has refused to answer,\" Nathan said.",
      "Kenneth Caruso, one of Giuliani's lawyers, said some of the items are now in a storage facility in suburban Ronkonkoma, New York, and claimed Giuliani has \"no control\" of it.",
      "Liman warned Caruso to \"consider your words\" about access to the storage facility, because it could end up the subject of a contempt hearing if Giuliani doesn't turn over the property he owes.",
      "A jury in December 2023 awarded the pair $148 million in damages for lies Giuliani spread about them after the 2020 presidential election. The massive award sent Giuliani into bankruptcy, and entitled the defamed women to much of what he owns.",
      "Asked by a reporter after Thursday's hearing if he regretted defaming Freeman and Moss, Giuliani exclaimed, \"No!\" He then denied defaming them.",
      "Liman had given Giuliani until Oct. 29 to surrender a long list of possessions, including the Mercedes, two dozen high-end watches, a jersey signed by New York Yankees Hall of Famer Joe DiMaggio \u2014 long featured prominently above the fireplace in Giuliani's $5 million apartment \u2014 as well as other furniture and sports memorabilia. The women are also entitled to some $2 million that Giuliani has said President-elect Trump's 2020 campaign owes him.",
      "In another tense moment, Caruso called it \"vindictive\" that Giuliani must turn over a watch that's an heirloom previously owned by his grandfather. Liman raised his voice, saying \"Oh, come on,\" before pointing to other cases he hears regularly, such as people \"who run bodegas and short their employees' wages.\"",
      "\"If they have a debt, they have to pay the debt. It doesn't matter if it's an heirloom.\" Liman said. He later said Moss and Freeman had been willing to let Giuliani keep the watch, but he never filed paperwork asking to do so.",
      "Giuliani was in the passenger's seat of a Mercedes convertible that appeared to be the 1980 classic once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall when he arrived to vote in Florida on Tuesday.",
      "Later that day, a spokesperson for the former New York City mayor and disbarred ex-attorney for Trump seemed to confirm it was the same vehicle, and said they've attempted to turn it over.",
      "In court on Thursday, Kenneth Caruso, a lawyer for Giuliani, said he believed the half century old car could be appraised as being worth less than $4,000. He noted that a court order allows him to keep a vehicle to that value.",
      "Caruso had asked Liman to allow Giuliani to attend the hearing remotely, as he had previously. Caruso said Giuliani is under contract to do evening radio appearances on Thursdays and Fridays. Caruso said Giuliani uses \"broadcasting equipment\" in his Florida home.",
      "Liman rejected that request. On Thursday, he gave lawyers for the women until Nov. 11 to instruct Giuliani on how to turn over his property, and Giuliani four days after to comply.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced its second interest rate cut of 2024, trimming its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points amid cooling inflation. The expected move by the U.S. central bank provides additional relief to millions of Americans grappling with high borrowing costs.",
      "The Fed cut, half the size of its September reduction, lowers the federal funds rate \u2014 the interest rate banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 to a range of 4.5% to 4.75% from its current 4.75% to 5% level.",
      "The announcement marks the Fed's first interest rate decision since President-elect Donald Trump secured another term in the White House\u00a0following the Nov. 5 election.

      "The two rate cuts so far this year, which have reduced the federal funds rate by a combined 0.75 percentage points, but the larger impact will be felt if the Fed continues to cut rates at its December meeting and into 2025, experts say.",
      "\"The Fed cutting rates a quarter point this month is more about a long-term trend,\" Christopher Clarke, a professor of economics at Washington State University, told CBS News. \"People should think about this as a half a point a month ago, a quarter point this month, a quarter point next month.\"",

      "While many economists expect an additional cut at the Fed's December meeting and more reductions in early 2025, any future moves by monetary policy makers appear more uncertain following the election amid concerns that some of Trump's key economic proposals could stoke inflation.",
      "\"With additional inflation and employment data in, the Fed went 25 basis points as expected.

Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v.

      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",

In August 2020, he said he would win that election and then \"go another four years\" because \"they spied on my campaign,\" according to Forbes.

    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",

    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

      "The Dragon's Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from historic launch pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 9:29 p.m. EST Monday, lighting up the night sky for miles around as it climbed away atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust.",
      "After boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the first stage, making its fifth flight, peeled away, reversed course and headed back to an on-target landing at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station while the second stage continued the climb to space.",

      "Just under 10 minutes after liftoff, the vacuum-optimized engine powering the Falcon 9's second stage shut down and one minute later, the Dragon was released to fly on its own.",
      "Running slightly ahead of schedule, the cargo ship executed a series of rendezvous rocket firings, catching up with the space station from behind and below before looping up to docking at the lab's forward port at 9:52 a.m.",
      "\"Welcome aboard, Dragon,\" astronaut Barry \"Butch\" Wilmore radioed from inside the station. \"Nice to  have you aboard.\" Station commander Sunita Williams, referring to the  successful docking in general and the food on board in particular,  added: \"Just want to say thank you to SpaceX, the International Space  Station program, the Commercial Crew program for bringing us... honey.\"",
      "One of the first items on the agenda is a test Friday to determine the Cargo Dragon's ability to boost the space station's orbit slightly using its aft-facing thrusters. The ISS is routinely re-boosted by Russian Progress freighters and Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ships, but Friday's test will be a first for SpaceX.",
      "The California rocket builder is under contract to NASA to build a powerful space tug of sorts that can be used to safely drive the ISS back into the atmosphere when the lab complex is retired in the 2030 timeframe. The vehicle is needed to make sure the station breaks up over a stretch of ocean well away from populated areas and shipping lanes.",
      "During the test Friday, the Cargo Dragon's aft thrusters will fire for about 12 minutes.",
      "\"The data that we're going to collect from this reboost and attitude control demonstration will be very helpful, informing SpaceX analyses on how the system performs,\" said Jared Metter, SpaceX director of flight reliability. \"This data is going to lead to future capabilities, namely the US de-orbit vehicle.\"",
      "Reboost aside, the Cargo Dragon is loaded with slightly more than 6,000 pounds of equipment and supplies, including 2,022 pounds of science gear, 2,119 pounds of crew clothing, food and other supplies, 377 pounds of spacewalk equipment, 525 pounds of space station hardware and 44 pounds of computer equipment.",
      "One of the more unusual payloads: Lignosat, a small wooden satellite using a framework of magnolia panels built by researchers at Kyoto University in Japan and the Tokyo-based logging company Sumitomo.",
      "\"While some of you might think that wood in space seems a little counterintuitive, researchers hope that this investigation demonstrates that a wooden satellite can be more sustainable and less polluting for the environment than conventional satellites,\" said Meghan Everett, the ISS deputy project scientist.",
      "\"The main objective here is to determine whether wood can be used in space, and to do this, researchers will measure the temperature and strain of the wooden structure and see how it might change in the vacuum environment of space with atomic oxygen and radiation conditions as well.\"",

      "Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager, said the \"food kit\" includes \"citrus, apples, sweet onions, blueberries, radishes, etc,\" along with lobster, crab and quail for holiday meals. A variety of cheeses is on board as well as fresh coffee and personal items requested by each crew member.",
      "Mounted in the Dragon's unpressurized trunk section is the Coronal Diagnostic Experiment, or CODEX, an instrument that will be mounted outside the space station to learn more about how charged particles in the solar wind are heated to millions of degrees and accelerated to enormous velocities, affecting Earth's space environment and the rest of the solar system.",
      "Inside the station, the astronauts will have a variety of new experiments and instruments to operate and monitor, including one called ARTEMOSS that will examine how Antarctic moss tolerates the space radiation and microgravity environment to learn more about how plants might be used in future life support systems.",
      "The European Space Agency is sending up a space exposure experiment to learn more about how high-tech materials respond to prolonged exposure to the weightless environment and another experiment to study how organic samples degrade when exposed to unfiltered ultraviolet light from the sun.",

    "summary": "As votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle.",
    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "title": "Australia plans \"world-leading\" social media ban for children under 16",
    "published": "Thu, 07 Nov 2024 14:04:53 -0500",
    "summary": "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" says Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanse.",
    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",
      "Last month, a coalition of over 140 Australian and international experts signed an open letter\u00a0to Albanese outlining concerns about the proposed age limit.",
      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",
      "In April, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators including Republican Ted Cruz of Texas and Democrat Brian Schatz of Hawaii\u00a0introduced legislation that, among other provisions, would \"prohibit children under the age of 13 from creating or maintaining social media accounts, consistent with the current practices of major social media companies,\" and \"Prohibit social media companies from recommending content using algorithms to users under the age of 17.\"",
      "A 2023\u00a0advisory\u00a0from the U.S. Surgeon General's office said there were mental health benefits for children and teens when they reduce or eliminate exposure to social media for longer than a month.",
      "Most social media companies have policies that bar children under the age of 13 from setting up accounts, but a 2022 study conducted by the U.K.'s media regulator Ofcom found that nearly 80% of children in the country had social media accounts by the age of 12.",

    "story": [
      "A man has been arrested in connection with a spate of random stabbings over two days in Seattle, in which a woman and eight men were injured \u2014 five of them on Friday afternoon, police said.",
      "\"This incident was apparently one individual over a 38-hour period of time committing random assaults,\" Deputy Chief Eric Barden said at the scene Friday.",
      "The stabbings on Friday afternoon took place in a roughly four-block area in Seattle's Chinatown-International District.",
      "Witnesses reported a description of the suspect and officers found him nearby and took him into custody, police said. A weapon was found near the person who was arrested, and a knife was lodged in one of the victims, police said.",
      "Four of the victims, all males, were taken to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle and one victim was treated at the scene and released. A hospital spokesperson told CBS News Friday evening that two of the victims were in critical condition and a third was in serious condition.",
      "Barden said police suspect that the person arrested in connection with Friday's stabbings is the same person involved with at least four other stabbings that happened starting early Thursday. He cited similar suspect descriptions and the randomness of the attacks, but added that the investigation is ongoing.",
      "The Thursday stabbings in Chinatown started when a 52-year-old woman was found with multiple stab wounds, police said. On Thursday afternoon, a 32-year-old man was found after being stabbed multiple times and at about 8 p.m. a 37-year-old man was stabbed multiple times in the back, police said.",
      "Then early on Friday, police responding to an assault call found a 53-year-old man bleeding heavily from a neck injury. Police followed a blood trail to a nearby doorway and unsuccessfully used that as a starting point for police dogs to try and track a suspect.",
      "\"It is my understanding that everyone is alive,\" Barden said of the victims on Friday afternoon.",
      "Police said a 10th stabbing on Thursday night involved a cellphone robbery in which someone forcibly opened a vehicle door and tried to stab a 60-year-old man in the chest. The victim blocked the assault and was cut on his hand, police said. It was not clear that it was connected to the random attacks, police said.",

    "story": [
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is now on a short list being floated by some Trump allies to serve as the next head of the Department of Health and Human Services, multiple people close to the president-elect's campaign say.",
      "Hopes among Kennedy's backers that he could be nominated to lead the department have risen in recent days, after Republicans cemented their majority in the Senate.",
      "Kennedy's odds of clearing a Senate led by Democrats would have been low, given his long record of what the party called \"anti-science, fringe public health stances\" that outraged Trump's opponents and a broad array of health experts during the campaign.",
      "That includes\u00a0a comment\u00a0that \"there's no vaccine that is safe and effective\" and his chairmanship of the group Children's Health Defense, which has claimed that the \"parallel between rising disease rates and the increasing number of childhood vaccines is hard to ignore.\" Doctors argue statements like these mislead about the safety of immunizations and threaten to erode hard-fought improvements in U.S. vaccination rates against preventable diseases.",
      "Kennedy himself has been noncommittal when asked publicly about the possibility he could be picked to head the sprawling HHS umbrella of agencies, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration.",
      "Ahead of the election, Kennedy told Fox News he was \"confident that if I wanted to do HHS secretary, the president would fight like hell to make that happen,\" but also said that he was unsure if that would be \"the most effective\" role for him.",
      "In a CNN interview last month, Trump transition co-chair Howard Lutnick, was asked whether Kennedy would be in charge of HHS.",
      "\"Of course not,\" he replied.",
      "But two people close to the campaign say the election results have played a big role in changing the thinking on whether Kennedy could clear a steep and often painful Senate confirmation process that can bog down nominees.",
      "Kennedy's supporters argue that the election offers a mandate not just for Trump's platform overall but for Kennedy and his \"Make America Healthy Again\" proposals to combat chronic disease, citing the votes Kennedy may have delivered in Trump's favor.",
      "As one example, podcast host Joe Rogan initially voiced support for Kennedy and his ideas before later endorsing Trump.",
      "\"We have not yet decided exactly what that strategy is going to be, but that is a possibility,\" Kennedy told NPR in an interview after the election, asked if he would be named to a Senate-confirmed position.",
      "As to the question of whether Kennedy is now in serious contention for the HHS secretary role, Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that Americans reelected Trump \"by resounding margins because they trust his judgement and support his policies, including his promise to Make America Healthy Again alongside well-respected leaders like RFK Jr.\"",
      "Other potential HHS secretary picks",
      "However, Kennedy is not the only name that has been floated by Republicans for the top job at HHS.",
      "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis suggested Wednesday his top health official, state surgeon general Dr. Joseph Ladapo, could be a candidate. Under Ladapo, the state's health department has warned some against getting COVID-19 booster shots, citing claims that federal health authorities and outside experts criticized as unproven or misleading.",
      "Other names floated by Trump allies in Washington include former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former deputy HHS secretary Eric Hargan, who supporters think could be effective because he knows how to navigate the department's bureaucracy.",
      "But people close to the campaign say few Trump surrogates and supporters have spent as much time with the president-elect as Kennedy or plotted as ambitious an agenda.",
      "The two spent hours flying together in the final stretch of the campaign. Kennedy was also in Florida after the election, huddling with the president-elect's top ranks to weigh potential candidates to fill the administration.",
      "\"He's going to help make America healthy again. And he's a great guy and he really means it. He wants to do some things, and we're going to let him go to it,\" Trump said on Wednesday morning after the election.",
      "Trump has previously said he's been friends with Kennedy \"for a long time\" and would let him \"go wild\" on many of his policy priorities, except for curbing fossil fuels.",
      "\"I'm going to let him go wild on health. I'm going to let him go wild on the food. I'm going to let him go wild on medicines. The only thing I don't think I'm going to let him even get near is the liquid gold that we have under our feet,\" Trump said in New York on Oct. 27.",
      "Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" platform",
      "Kennedy's nomination would come at a key time for many of the issues he campaigned on, which he says underpin \"the chronic-disease crisis.\"",
      "Kennedy has accused the FDA of \"aggressive suppression\" of a range of products, including psychedelics \u2014 after MDMA failed to earn the agency's approval earlier this year \u2014 and raw milk, which officials have discouraged amid the ongoing bird flu outbreak on dairy farms.",
      "Other proposals include restricting pharmaceutical advertising and rewriting the laws that currently rely on drugmakers paying fees to fund most FDA approvals. Ahead of the election, he warned FDA officials who \"are part of this corrupt system\" to \"pack your bags.\"",
      "In the days ahead of the election, Kennedy said Trump had asked him to \"root out the corruption and the conflicts of interests\" in agencies that oversee drugs and vaccines, pledging to \"restore transparency\" and stop \"hiding science.\"",
      "\"He doesn't want me to take vaccines away from people. If you want to take a vaccine, you ought to be able to take it. We believe in free choice in this country,\" Kennedy said in remarks posted on Nov. 2.",
      "His call for stopping water fluoridation comes as the Environmental Protection Agency is now facing a court order to take action against the practice.",
      "That ruling was driven in part by a review released by the NIH earlier this year, examining the risk it might lower children's IQ, and comes as critics have called on the CDC to revise its statement backing fluoridation. The NIH review found that concentrations of fluoride in drinking water higher than recommended levels were associated with lower IQ in children, but more studies were needed on the effect of lower concentrations of fluoride.",
      "But were he to end up HHS secretary, some of Kennedy's aims would fall outside of his jurisdiction, like the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Other responsibilities under the broad HHS umbrella could consume much of Kennedy's time, some allies worry, distracting from his priorities.",
      "\"Bobby is very action-oriented, brilliant, an excellent communicator, has a great grasp of details, and is a transformational leader. He is not, his skillset is not, as a bureaucrat administrator,\" said Dr. Robert Malone, a longtime Kennedy ally who was with him and Trump on election night.",
      "Malone said he had spoken with many of the aides from some of the \"at least four different HHS transition teams\" under Trump, but not personally with Kennedy, in recent weeks about the future of the department.",
      "He said he thought Kennedy would likely do better in a role at the White House, serving as a czar who could target specific issues across different departments.",

    "summary": "Medical issues aside, the astronauts described a water leak in June that triggered a blizzard in the International Space Station's airlock.",
    "story": [
      "Three NASA astronauts who just wrapped up a 235-day mission to the International Space Station discussed their flight with reporters Friday, but steadfastly refused to comment on a medical issue of some sort that resulted in one astronaut spending the night in a hospital after landing.",
      "The unidentified astronaut flew back to the Johnson Space Center in Houston the day after splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico on Oct. 25, rejoining their crewmates. But NASA, citing medical privacy issues, provided no details other than to say the astronaut \"is in good health and will resume normal post-flight reconditioning with other crew members.\"",
      "\"I know there may be some interest in our post-flight medical event, where we diverted to a hospital,\" Crew 8 pilot Mike Barratt, a physician-astronaut, told reporters Friday. \"You know, space flight is still something we don't fully understand. We're finding things that we don't expect sometimes, and this was one of those times.",
      "\"We're still piecing things together on this. And so to maintain medical privacy and to let our processes go forward in an orderly manner, this is all we're going to say about that event at this time.\"",
      "Barratt, Crew 8 commander Matt Dominick, astronaut Jeanette Epps and Russian cosmonaut Alexander Grebenkin were launched from the Kennedy Space Center on March 3 and docked at the space station two days later. They returned to Earth last month after an extended stay in space.",
      "Barratt, Dominick and Epps all appeared healthy and in good spirits Friday as they continue their re-adjustment to gravity. Grebenkin flew back to Moscow shortly after splashdown, but in a social media post just after the crew's return to Earth, he was smiling and said to be in good shape.",
      "While the presumably minor medical issue remains a mystery, the crew shared highlights of their stay in space, including details about a water leak during preparations for a June spacewalk that triggered a blizzard in the space station's airlock.",
      "After a spacesuit \"discomfort\" problem forced Dominick and astronaut Tracy Dyson to call off a planned spacewalk on June 13, Dyson and Barratt suited up for another excursion on June 24.",
      "While floating in the airlock with the outer hatch open to space, an umbilical failed to \"seat\" properly and water began spewing into the chamber.",
      "\"Oh, my goodness,\" Dyson said when she noticed the water spewing out. \"There's a lot of water flowing. There's literally water everywhere. ... I've got ice all over my helmet.\"",
      "\"It was not a trivial leak,\" Barratt reflected Friday. \"Anybody who was watching NASA TV at the time could see there was basically a snowstorm, a blizzard spewing from the air lock, because we already had the hatch open. We were seeing flakes of ice in the air lock. Tracy was seeing a lot of them on her helmet, on her gloves, whatnot.",
      "\"So it was...dramatic is the right word, to be real honest. I think literally, Tracy's actions were nowhere short of a heroic to be able to re-mate that umbilical with her hands covered with ice and kind of being vision impaired and getting the air lock closed.\"",
      "Barratt said he grabbed her space-suited legs so Dyson could \"lever that thing closed, and she just made it happen. So yeah, there was a bit of drama. Everything worked out fine. And again, normal processes and procedures saved our bacon.\"",
      "NASA plans to resume spacewalks in January, and Barratt said the suits will be in good shape.",
      "\"I think we're leaving them a brand new umbilical, a really clean interface on that side where we had the problem and the suits are charged and really ready to go,\" he said. \"So I think we are more than ready for the next EVA campaign. I just wish we were doing it.\"",
      "That said, he pointed out, \"none of our spacesuits are spring chickens. And so we will expect to see some hardware issues with repeated use. So again, it's one of those things that we are always, at every second, ready to stop...or work a contingency procedure.\"",
      "As for the suit \"discomfort\" issue that Dominick reported prior to the earlier spacewalk attempt, no details were provided.",

    "story": [
      "By the time the polls opened on Election Day, baseless claims of voter fraud had been building on social media for months, fueling doubts about the integrity of the election.",
      "Posts proliferated on X and other platforms pointing to hiccups like technical issues with voting machines, power outages and spelling errors on ballots as examples of a supposedly brewing conspiracy. And at 4:30 p.m. on Election Day, former President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social that there was \"a lot of talk about massive cheating\" in Pennsylvania \u2014 which officials said had \"no factual basis whatsoever.\"",
      "But as the votes were tallied and it became clear that Trump was on his way to a decisive victory, the deluge of posts questioning the integrity of the election fell to a trickle, researchers say.",
      "\"I think this shows that these narratives are pushed when they serve a purpose, and they are stage setting often for efforts to dispute unfavorable results,\" said Max Read, a senior researcher at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. \"And then once that stage setting and those claims are no longer needed, they're not pushed anymore.\"",
      "The shift was stark in Elon Musk's \"Election Integrity Community,\" a group of nearly 65,000 started by the platform owner's political action committee encouraging members to report \"voter fraud or irregularities.\"",
      "The group had already become a repository for speculation and unfounded rumors before Election Day. When the polls opened, hundreds of posts an hour were shared until the early hours of the morning on Wednesday, when the race was called for Trump in Pennsylvania, all but eliminating a winning path for Vice President Kamala Harris.",
      "After that, the posting drastically diminished.",
      "Read's team at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue also found that mentions across the platform of voting machines in Pennsylvania and Michigan soared on Tuesday afternoon but dropped to hardly any by Wednesday morning.",
      "On Tuesday morning, a software error caused voting machines to be temporarily down in Cambria County, a county in southwestern Pennsylvania with a population of about 131,000. Voters used paper ballots and a court order extended voting hours from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. But some on social media baselessly suggested the technical issues were something nefarious, a plot to discard votes in a county Trump won by a wide margin in both of the last two elections.",
      "Danielle Lee Tompson, who leads the Center for an Informed Public's research on election rumors at the University of Washington, said the narrative around Pennsylvania voting machines echoed the conversation around election issues in Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022. In that election, some ballots were printed with ink too light to be read by tabulators, so they were placed in a secure box and counted separately at the state's election headquarters. Claims that the errors were intentional fueled a lawsuit challenging the results that was later dismissed.",
      "\"On Election Day, we can always expect there to be irregularities or glitches or problems at polling sites,\" Tompson said. \"The question is will those issues be contorted into a larger narrative that election fraud is happening.\"",
      "While the volume of election rumors has drastically decreased, false claims are still spreading about races that have not yet been called. In Arizona, where Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake trails Democratic candidate Ruben Gallego, social users on the right are using the fact that Gallego had more votes than Harris by Friday to cast doubt on the validity of his lead.",
      "Meanwhile, turnout numbers are being twisted by both the left and the right to cast doubt on election results. While millions of votes are still being counted, some point to higher turnout in 2020 as evidence that there are 20 million \"missing votes.\" On the right, some claim this is evidence that 2020 was stolen from Trump; on the left, some say it's grounds for a recount.",
      "But the volume of posts questioning Harris's loss was nowhere near the \"Stop the Steal\" efforts that followed Trump's 2020 election loss, according to both Tompson and Read's research. No elected officials cast doubt on the outcome the way Trump pushed election denial when he lost in 2020. Harris urged all Americans to accept the results of the election in her concession speech on Wednesday.",
      "\"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" Harris said. \"And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"",

    "summary": "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn is holding off on enforcing his ruling for 30 days to allow Illinois leaders time to appeal.",
    "story": [
      "CHICAGO (CBS) --\u00a0A federal judge in downstate Illinois has ruled the state's ban on assault weapons is unconstitutional, but will hold off on prohibiting the state from enforcing it for one month to allow for a likely appeal.",
      "U.S. District Judge Stephen McGlynn, who sits on the federal court in East Saint Louis, wrote in his 168-page opinion that the statewide ban on assault-style weapons violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The Protect Illinois Communities Act\u00a0bans the sale of assault-style weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requires existing owners of those weapons to register them with Illinois State Police.",
      "The legislation, signed into law in January 2023, banned dozens of specific brands or types of rifles and handguns, .50-caliber guns, attachments and rapid-firing devices. No rifle will be allowed to accommodate more than 10 rounds, with a 15-round limit for handguns.",
      "As part of his ruling that the assault weapons ban is unconstitutional, McGlynn issued a permanent injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ban, but he stayed that injunction for 30 days to give the state time to file an appeal.",
      "Gun control laws have come under renewed scrutiny in the wake of the\u00a0Supreme Court's June 2022 decision\u00a0that imposed a new framework for evaluating the constitutionality of gun restrictions. In that ruling, the court said that for firearms laws to comply with the Second Amendment, the government must identify historical analogues that show the measure is consistent with the nation's history and tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "McGlynn sided with plaintiffs who argued the Illinois assault weapons ban does not fit within the Supreme Court's framework, and who argued that assault weapons are commonly used for self-defense.",
      "\"What is particularly disturbing is that the prohibition of weapons that are commonly owned and used by citizens are now banned, depriving citizens of a principal means to defend themselves and their property in situations where a handgun or shotgun alone would not be the citizen's preferred arm,\" McGlynn wrote. \"Sadly, there are those who seek to usher in a sort of post-Constitution era where the citizens' individual rights are only as important as they are convenient to a ruling class.\"",
      "McGlynn compared the use of firearms for self-defense to equipping vehicles with airbags, ocean liners with lifeboats, or houses with storm shelters.",
      "\"Why do we protect ourselves with firearms? In life, we face many perils,\" He wrote. \"Too often, the perils we face are forced upon us by other people. By people who are negligent, reckless, insane, impaired, or evil. Sometimes it is the proverbial lone wolf; sometimes, it is the whole wolf pack. Truly, life comes at you quickly. And who comes to our aid in times of peril? Sometimes, it is the police or first responders; other times it is healthcare professionals; and sometimes it is family, friends, or neighbors. Sometimes, it is no one.\"",
      "Before the case went to trial earlier this year, McGlynn issued a temporary injunction prohibiting Illinois from enforcing the assault weapons ban, but a federal appeals court later reversed that decision. In July, the Supreme Court declined to take up the case, sending it back to McGlynn for a trial, which was held in September.",
      "Meanwhile, a case against an assault weapons ban in Maryland has been upped to the Supreme Court. If the Supreme Court takes the Maryland case, it could take the Illinois case\u2014or send it back to the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "Two similar lawsuits are pending in federal court in Chicago.",
      "Gun rights and gun control advocates react",
      "Dan Eldridge was one of the plaintiffs who argued that assault-style weapons banned under Illinois law are commonly used for self-defense purposes.",
      "\"Illinois does not want to be the test case that shows all of these state so-called assault weapon bans are unconstitutional,\" said Dan Eldridge, president of Firearm Licensees of Illinois.",
      "Eldridge said the judge simply decided the Illinois law ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution.",
      "\"This trial was on the merits of the case, and he found in our favor, and found that PICA's 'assault weapon' ban is unconstitutional under the 2nd and 14th amendments,\" he said.",
      "Rachel Jacoby of Highland Park was in Springfield on Jan. 10, 2023\u2014the day Gov. JB Pritzker signed the ban int law\u2014representing her community. It was July 4, 2022, when a man with a high-powered rifle opened fire on an Independence Day parade in Highland Park and killed seven people.",
      "\"This ruling is a slap in the face to every single person in Illinois who's been affected by gun violence, because those of us who have been personally affected by gun violence know the pain and trauma that comes from experiencing this,\" Jacoby said, \"and this judge's ruling is callous and unfounded in my opinion.\"",
      "Although the State of Illinois has already appealed the ruling, Eldridge said he hopes the plaintiffs are fortunate enough to win.",
      "\"And everything goes back to how it was on January 9 of 2023,\" Eldridge said.",
      "Jacoby hopes the ban stays in place, because regular people should not be able to access assault-style weapons.",
      "\"We know firsthand the devastation and trauma that these assault weapons can cause our communities, and we want to make sure that no other community has to experience that pain, that carnage, and that horror that we experienced,\" she said.",
      "In a statement, the office of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said:",
      "\"The Protect Illinois Communities Act was the result of hundreds of hours of deliberation between legal experts, legislators, and advocates, and it makes Illinois a safer place for everyone. Despite those who value weapons of war more than public safety, this law was enacted to and has protected Illinoisans from the constant fear of being gunned down in places where they ought to feel secure. We look forward to the Attorney General filing an immediate appeal and the Governor is confident the constitutionality of the Protect Illinois Communities Act will be upheld through this process.\"",

    "summary": "It's the first time Trump has topped an opponent in the popular vote\u200b, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so.",
    "story": [
      "While the 2024 presidential election was among the closest in recent memory \u2014 with President-elect Donald Trump ahead by about 3 percentage points over Vice President Kamala Harris \u2014 Trump's vote share grew in a diverse array of regions across the country and across different demographic groups.",
      "It's the first time in Trump's three campaigns for the White House that he's topped his opponent in the popular vote, and only the second time since 1988 that any Republican has done so. In 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton won almost 66 million votes (48%), compared to Trump's nearly 63 million (46%), but Trump won the Electoral College. In 2020, he lost both the Electoral College and the popular vote to President Biden, who received about 81 million votes (51%) nationwide, compared to Trump's 74 million (47%).",
      "Trump's victory in 2024 was driven by improvements in support in a vast majority of counties nationwide \u2014 more than 9 in 10 \u2014 according to data from counties where at least 95% of votes have been counted as of Friday. Trump's improvements crossed regions, and included urban, suburban and rural gains.",
      "Trump even fared better in most places where a majority of voters preferred Harris, like New Jersey, or across the Hudson River, in his hometown of New York City.",
      "The Garden State, a longtime Democratic stronghold, swung markedly in Trump's favor. For instance, the latest data show Trump with a slim 3% lead in suburban Passaic County, where he got just 41% of the vote in 2020.",
      "In New York City, where Trump grew up and spent most of his life before entering politics, he didn't just surpass his two previous results; his roughly 30% vote share topped every Republican candidate since Ronald Reagan, 40 years ago.",
      "Nearly 2,000 miles away, Maverick County, Texas, a majority Latino border county that Biden carried easily in 2020, swung even more, about 28 points. Trump in 2024 outperformed Biden's 2020 showing, and Harris fared worse than Trump did in 2020.",
      "CBS News exit polls from the last two elections showed Trump gaining among both men and women this year. In 2020, Trump won men by a hair, 49% to 48%, but in 2024, his campaign's efforts to woo men appear to have paid off: his support from men grew to 55%.",
      "In 2020, Trump managed to win 43% of women voters. In 2024, despite Democrats' focus on women voters and abortion access, which boosted them in the midterm election races, Trump still increased his numbers with women, notching up that figure two ticks, to 45%.",
      "Trump made gains among core groups within the traditional Republican coalition, such as evangelical voters. But he also increased his support among groups Democrats have relied on, including young voters and Latino voters, such as those in Maverick County and another former Democratic stronghold, Florida's Miami-Dade, which Mr. Biden won in 2020, with 53%. This year, Trump carried the county with about 55% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to win there since 1988.",

    "summary": "Richard Allen could be sentenced to up to 130 years in prison if convicted of all the charges.",
    "story": [
      "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014\u00a0The first full day of jury deliberations ended without a verdict on Friday in the trial of Richard Allen, who is accused in the 2017 killings of two teenage girls who had vanished during a hike in Delphi, Indiana.",
      "Jurors began their deliberations Thursday afternoon, spending two hours deliberating before wrapping up for the day. They then spent seven hours on Friday deliberating without reaching a verdict, and will return Saturday morning.",
      "Allen had pleaded not guilty to two murder and two felony murder charges in connection with the 2017 deaths of Liberty \"Libby\" German and Abigail \"Abby\" Williams, who were 14 and 13, respectively.",
      "He could be sentenced to up to 130 years in prison if convicted of all the charges.",
      "The seven women and five men continued their deliberations Friday after hearing closing arguments\u00a0in the weekslong murder trial. Deliberations ended after about two hours and will resume Friday morning. They will deliberate from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Saturday until they reach a verdict, CNN reports.",
      "Carroll County Prosecutor Nicholas McLeland told jurors that Allen is the man seen in a grainy cellphone video recorded by one of the girls, known as Abby and Libby, as they crossed an abandoned railroad bridge just before they vanished on Feb. 13, 2017.",
      "\"Richard Allen is Bridge Guy,\" McLeland told jurors. \"He kidnapped them and later murdered them.\"",
      "He noted that Allen had confessed repeatedly to the killings \u2014 in person, on the phone and in writing. In one of the recordings he replayed for the jury, Allen could be heard telling his wife, \"I did it. I killed Abby and Libby.\"",
      "Allen's defense cast doubt on the confessions, putting up witnesses, including a psychiatrist who testified that Allen was delirious and psychotic after months in solitary confinement. The defense further argued there is no physical evidence tying Allen to the murders and said confessions he made in the past were \"involuntary\" and stemmed from being in solitary confinement for months.",
      "No witness explicitly identified Allen as the man seen on the hiking trail or the bridge the afternoon the girls went missing, he noted. No fingerprint, DNA or forensic evidence links Allen to the murder scene, Rozzi said.",
      "And for more than five years after the teens were killed, Allen still lived in Delphi while working at a local pharmacy.",
      "\"He had every chance to run, but he did not because he didn't do it,\" he told the jurors.",
      "Before the trial began, Allen's lawyers had sought to argue that the girls were killed\u00a0in a ritual sacrifice\u00a0by members of a white nationalist group known as the Odinists who follow a pagan Norse religion, but the judge ruled against that, saying the defense \"failed to produce admissible evidence\" of such a connection.",
      "Timeline of events surrounding Delphi murders",
      "The Delphi murder case goes back to February 13, 2017, when \"Abby\" and \"Libby\" went for a hike on the Monon High Bridge in Delphi. The two girls were reported missing after they failed to meet Libby's father that afternoon. The next day, their bodies were found, both dead from cuts to the throat, partially covered by sticks.",
      "The case attracted public attention in part because of a photo and audio recording of the suspect taken from Libby's smartphone. The image shows a man walking on the bridge with his hands in his pockets, and the audio includes a man's muffled voice saying, \"Guys, down the hill.\" Although police circulated the photo and audio just days after the killings and identified the \"Bridge Guy\" as their prime suspect, the case ran cold for more than five years until Allen was arrested in 2022.",
      "Allen had seemingly evaded police notice, staying in the small town of Delphi and working at a local CVS pharmacy, until a clerk digitizing tips related to the investigation in September 2022 noticed he had placed himself at the scene of the crime. Just days after the bodies were discovered, Allen told police he had been on that trail during the timeframe the girls were thought to have been killed.",
      "Carroll County Sheriff Tony Liggett said despite the tip, Allen \"got lost in the cracks,\" according to CNN affiliate WLFI. Around a month after the tip was rediscovered, Allen was arrested after police matched an unspent cartridge found between the girls' bodies to a pistol recovered from his home during a police search.",
      "After Allen was arrested on October 26, 2022, he was charged with two counts of murder while committing or attempting to commit a kidnapping five days later. Prosecutors later amended the charges to include two additional counts of murder.",
      "Over the course of the trial, which began October 18, the prosecution highlighted Allen's\u00a0dozens of confessions\u00a0while incarcerated: He confessed to the crime more than 60 times, prosecutors say, including to his wife, his mother, the psychologist who treated him, the warden and other prison employees and inmates. They played audio recordings of some of the confessions for the jury.",
      "Monica Wala, the former lead psychologist at Westville Correctional Facility where Allen was housed, testified he initially told her he was innocent, but began confessing to the crimes in April 2023, around the time he was placed back on suicide watch.",
      "Wala testified that Allen had told her, \"I killed Abby and Libby. I'm sorry,\"\u00a0according to WTHR. He said he originally planned to sexually assault the victims but ran away when he saw a van nearby, and that he had cut the girls' throats and covered their bodies with sticks, she testified.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump's victory Tuesday has stirred up whispers about whether Justice Sonia Sotomayor should step down from the Supreme Court to allow President Biden to nominate a successor before Republicans take control of Washington.",
      "But any changes in the composition of the nation's highest court are unlikely in the coming months, even as lawmakers return for a lame-duck session to finish their business before Trump is sworn in for a second term and the GOP assumes the Senate majority.",
      "Sotomayor hasn't responded publicly to the chatter about a retirement, and she did not return a request for comment about her future. She remains an active questioner during oral arguments and has become known for biting dissents in hotly contested cases.",
      "At 70, she is not the oldest member of the Supreme Court \u2014 Justice Clarence Thomas is 76 and Justice Samuel Alito is 74 \u2014 and she is newly into her tenure as the senior-most member of its liberal wing, a position she assumed following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer in 2022.",
      "Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, is also a decade younger than Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was when she faced pressure to step down from the Supreme Court in 2013 and 2014.",
      "Ginsburg, who was treated for early-stage colon cancer in 1999 and pancreatic cancer in 2009, rejected any suggestion that she retire to allow then-President Barack Obama to name a successor while Democrats had control of the Senate. She remained on the Supreme Court until her death in September 2020, after which Trump, nearing the end of his first term, selected Justice Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. Barrett's confirmation by the GOP-led Senate widened the Supreme Court's conservative majority to 6-3.",
      "With a second term for Trump on the horizon, and Democrats losing control of the Senate come January, when Republicans will hold at least 52 seats, progressives are fearful of a repeat of what happened with Ginsburg's seat.",
      "\"We have no idea how long it will be until somebody who shares Justice Sotomayor's jurisprudence, her values will be in a position to be nominated again,\" Molly Coleman, executive director of the People's Parity Project, a progressive judicial group, told CBS News. \"Of course we all want to hope for the best, but unfortunately we've been left in a position where that's all we can do.\"",
      "The circumstances of more than a decade ago are different from today, making it far from a sure thing that even if Sotomayor were to retire, the Senate would confirm her replacement before the GOP takes over. For one, Democrats currently have a narrow 51-49 majority, which includes the four independent senators who vote with the party.",
      "One of those senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, told Politico in March that he would not support nominees who do not have GOP support.",
      "\"Just one Republican. That's all I'm asking for. Give me something bipartisan. This is my own little filibuster. If they can't get one Republican, I vote for none. I've told [Democrats] that. I said, 'I'm sick and tired of it, I can't take it anymore,'\" Manchin, who is retiring from the Senate, said.",
      "He later appeared to slightly reverse course, voting in September to advance the nomination of a candidate for a federal appeals court. A spokesperson for the senator told Axios at the time that Manchin learned opposition to the nominee was based on how the White House handled the process, not qualifications.",
      "Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California Berkeley Law School, said there is not enough time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed by the Senate by early January. Incoming House and Senate members will be sworn in on Jan. 3, and the results of the election will be reaffirmed by Congress on Jan. 6.",
      "\"Joe Manchin made clear he would not vote for any nominee without Republican support and no Republican would vote for a Biden nominee to replace Sotomayor. Sotomayor retiring now would likely just give Trump a vacancy to fill. It is totally different from whether Ginsburg should have retired in summer 2014 before the election,\" he told CBS News in an email.",
      "Chemerinsky wrote in September 2014 that Ginsburg should have retired that summer and warned her decision not to \"could end up hurting her legal legacy.\" Democrats had control of the Senate at that time, but lost it following the November 2014 midterm elections.",
      "Even some progressive groups that called for open discussions about Sotomayor's future on the court months ago are recognizing that the window has closed.",
      "\"The reality is it's too late. It's too late for Democrats to be having this conversation. It's too late to be launching a pressure campaign. The ship has sailed,\" Coleman, of the People's Parity Project said.",
      "She said discussions should have happened earlier this year and warned the consequences of waiting may be \"catastrophic.\"",
      "Instead, liberal judicial advocacy groups are turning their focus to the confirming Mr. Biden's remaining nominees to the federal district and appeals courts. There are currently 47 open seats on the federal bench, and 17 nominees are awaiting Senate action. There will be another 20 vacancies in the coming weeks, and 11 nominees are pending for those seats.",
      "\"Hand wringing about the unknown doesn't help anyone right now,\" said Maggie Jo Buchanan, managing director of the judicial group Demand Justice. \"Right now, we are firmly focused on the fact that there are still 30 pending Biden nominees before the Senate that deserve, and need, confirmation. The Senate should be focused on working late, working weekends to get these talented individuals on the bench.\"",
      "Trump saw immense success with judicial confirmations during his first term, appointing 234 jurists to the Supreme Court, federal courts of appeals, district courts and U.S. Court of International Trade. But Mr. Biden is closing in on that number, with 213 appointments so far.",

    "summary": "An Iranian operative told investigators that he was tasked in September with assassinating Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
    "story": [
      "An operative working for Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps told federal investigators that he was tasked in September with \"surveilling, and, ultimately, assassinating\" President-elect Donald Trump, according to court records unsealed Friday.",
      "Prosecutors say Farhad Shakeri, who is believed to be residing in Iran, told investigators in a phone interview that unnamed IRGC officials pushed him to plan an attack against Trump last month. If the plan could not come together in time, the Iranian officials directed Shakeri to delay the plot until after the presidential election because the official \"assessed that [Trump] would lose the election,\" charging documents revealed.",
      "Shakeri and two individuals living in the U.S. \u2014 Carlisle Rivera of Brooklyn, New York; and Jonathon Loadholt of Staten Island \u2014 were charged as part of a broad Iran-backed scheme to allegedly surveille and ultimately assassinate individuals inside the U.S. who opposed the Iranian regime.",
      "FBI investigators wrote that Shakeri immigrated to the U.S. as a child from Iran, but was deported in 2008 after serving more than a decade in prison on robbery charges. They alleged the IRGC ultimately used Shakeri to recruit criminal contacts inside the U.S. to carry out specific operations like targeting an unnamed Iranian American journalist and activist living in New York.",
      "In February, prosecutors alleged Shakeri paid Rivera and Loadholt about $1,000 to monitor the activist \u2014 who has spoken out against Iran's regime \u2014 at an event at Fairfield University in Connecticut. The surveillance operations continued into March, according to court documents, when the pair allegedly traveled multiple times to the activist's Brooklyn home. Text messages, security camera footage and cell site location data revealed their numerous trips.",
      "\"On or about April 1, 2024, 9 SHAKERI and RIVERA exchanged voice notes discussing RIVERA and LOADHOLT' s efforts to locate and murder\" the Iranian American, court records said.",
      "\"This b**** is hard to catch, bro,\" Rivera allegedly said to Shakeri. \"There ain't gonna be no simple pull up, unless there['s] the luck of the draw.\"",
      "According to court records, Shakeri allegedly responded later, \"you just gotta have patience and don't, kicking, kick in the door is not an option because that's a fail, that's a fail maneuver. You gotta wait and have patience to catch her either going in the house or coming out, or following her out somewhere and taking care of it. Don't think about going in. In is a suicide move.\"",
      "Investigators searched online accounts belonging to Rivera and Loadholt in the course of the federal probe and uncovered numerous images of firearms and other weapons.",
      "In April, Shakeri agreed to pay Rivera and Loadholt $100,000 to \"finish the work\" and said he was tasked by the IRGC to hire individuals to assassinate the journalist. And by July, according to charging documents, the Iranians were growing impatient, instructing their U.S. assets to \"take care of it already.\"",
      "The alleged plot to kill the activist did not succeed.",
      "Rivera and Loadholt are not accused of being part of the plot to target Trump. They made their initial appearance in federal court on Thursday and were ordered detained, according to the Justice Department. Shakeri remains at large.",
      "\"We will not stand for the Iranian regime's attempts to endanger the American people and America's national security,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.",
      "The charges announced Friday are not the first brought against alleged operatives of the IRGC for plotting to kill Trump. Earlier this year, the FBI arrested Asif Merchant for planning to assassinate U.S. government officials, including potentially the president-elect. Merchant remains in custody and pleaded not guilty.",
      "On at least five occasions between September and November, Shakeri participated in \"voluntary telephonic interviews with FBI agents\" in exchange for a sentence reduction for another individual serving time in the U.S, court records said.",
      "During the interviews, he allegedly told the FBI of the IRGC's desire to kill the Iranian American activist and target Israeli tourists in Sri Lanka with a mass shooting event. Shakeri also told investigators that the IRGC tasked him with surveilling two Jewish American citizens living in New York, but he did not provide the Iranian officials with information about the unnamed targets.",
      "During the interview, Shakeri also allegedly told the FBI about the effort to target Trump.",
      "In a statement, FBI Director Christopher Wray said, \"The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps \u2014 a designated foreign terrorist organization \u2014 has been conspiring with criminals and hitmen to target and gun down Americans on U.S. soil and that simply won't be tolerated.\"",
      "The charges and allegations announced Friday are part of broader posture by U.S. intelligence and law enforcement to publicly bring attention to Iran's alleged efforts to quiet dissidents on U.S. soil and target U.S. government figures after the killing of IRGC General Qasem Soleimani by American forces in 2020. Trump and former members of his administration have been forced in recent years to increase his security due to the threats.",

    "story": [
      "Slickly designed websites. Unbelievable markdowns. A simple online search for semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic or Wegovy, can lead consumers down a rabbit hole of seemingly reputable online pharmacies in search of weight loss drugs at a discounted price. The temptation is clear for many Americans, but some of those deals come with a potentially deadly cost.",
      "U.S. consumers pay higher prices for weight loss drugs than any other country in the world, according to a 2023 KFF study. Cheaper alternatives online, however, are not always what they seem.",
      "\"People are really taking a risk by ordering these products online and not knowing the supplier that's sending it to them,\" said Salvatore Ingrassia, port director for Customs and Border Protection at New York's JFK Airport.",

      "Customs officials allowed CBS News a rare look into their operations, showcasing seized misbranded or counterfeit medications. Over two days, agents confiscated products from countries including Israel and Bangladesh. One shipment of suspected counterfeit Wegovy was hidden inside a Mickey Mouse puzzle for children.",
      "While these counterfeit drugs may look legitimate, they often contain dangerous substances.",
      "\"We've found things like antifreeze and incorrect amounts of active ingredients in these products,\" said Ingrassia.",
      "In September, customs agents in Cincinnati's port inspected 63 shipments containing apparently counterfeit and unapproved medications. That included several boxes containing counterfeit Ozempic, Wegovy and Trulicity injections. Other medications, including Botox and minoxidil, used for hair growth, were also seized by the authorities.",
      "The FDA is taking action",
      "The Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings to multiple online pharmacies selling suspected counterfeit products. The letters demand the sites stop selling the products that are in violation of FDA's standards or face legal action. Despite their efforts, a quick internet search by CBS News in September 2024 found these websites remain active or redirect users to other sites offering these questionable drugs.",

      "Authorities have arrested individuals involved in selling counterfeit drugs, including a Long Island woman suspected of selling misbranded Ozempic online. The woman pleaded not guilty to the charges and is out on bond. Court documents show that one victim reported lesions and infections after using the medication.",

      "\"If you're buying a drug legitimately priced at thousands of dollars for just $65, you should be asking questions,\" she said.",
      "What can consumers do?",
      "Chase advises consumers to only buy these drugs with a prescription from well-known pharmacies. Real weight-loss medication pens should have unique identification codes and proper labeling.",
      "If the label smears or appears misaligned, it's likely counterfeit. Uneven glue seams, lot numbers with crooked print, and cheap looking colors are also signs the products could be counterfeit, according to Chase.",
      "Ultimately, she believes the best defense is using sound judgment.",
      "\"Don't risk your health trying to get healthy,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Barcelona \u2014 A Spanish research vessel that investigates marine ecosystems has been abruptly diverted from its usual task to take on a new job: Helping in the increasingly desperate search for the missing from Spain's deadly floods. As the dire work continued in the eastern province of Valencia to find the victims of the disaster and clean up the mess left behind, more torrential rain unleashed flash floods farther north along the coast, near Girona.",
      "The 24 crew members aboard the Ram\u00f3n Margalef were preparing Friday to use its sensors and submergible robot to map an offshore area of about 14 square miles \u2014 the equivalent of more than 5,000 soccer fields \u2014 to see if they can locate vehicles that last week's catastrophic floods swept into the Mediterranean Sea.",
      "The hope is that a map of sunken vehicles could lead to the recovery of bodies. Nearly 100 people have been officially declared missing, and authorities admit that is likely more people are unaccounted for, in addition to more than 200 declared dead.",
      "But the severe weather was still causing problems further north in the Catalonia province, where heavy rain triggered severe flash floods Friday in the town of Cadaques, sweeping dozens of cars that had been parked in a  normally dry riverbed through the town and piling them up against a bridge, creating a blockage that worsened the flooding in the town.",
      "There were no reports immediate reports of casualties or major structural damage, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "Pablo Carrera, the marine biologist leading the Ram\u00f3n Margalef mission off Valencia's coast estimated that in 10 days his team would be able to hand over useful information to police and emergency services. Without a map, he said, it would be practically impossible for police to carry out an effective and systematic recovery operation to reach vehicles that ended up on the seabed.",
      "\"It would be like finding a needle in a haystack,\" Carrera told The Associated Press by phone.",
      "Many cars became death traps when the tsunami-like flooding hit on Oct. 29.",
      "The boat will join a wider effort by police and soldiers who have expanded their searches for bodies and the missing beyond the devastated towns and streets. Searchers have used poles to probe into layers of mud while sniffer dogs tried to find scent traces of bodies buried in canal banks and fields. They are also looking at beaches that line the coast.",
      "The first area the Ram\u00f3n Margalef is searching is the stretch of sea off the Albufera wetlands, where at least some of the water ended up after ripping through villages and the southern outskirts of Valencia city.",
      "Spanish state broadcaster said Friday that the body of one woman had been found on the beach after she went missing when the rushing water swept through her town of Pedralba, roughly an hour's drive from the coast.",
      "Carrera, 60, is head of the fleet of the research vessels run by the Spanish Institute of Oceanography, a government-funded science center under the umbrella of the Spanish National Research Council.",
      "He boarded the Ram\u00f3n Margalef in Alicante, located on Spain's south coast, from where it will set sail to reach Valencia's waters before dawn Saturday. The plan is to go straight to work with the 10 scientists and technicians and 14 sailors working non-stop in shifts. The boat also helped research the impact from the lava flow that reached the sea from the 2021 La Palma volcano eruption in Spain's Canary Islands.",
      "Finding a body at sea, Carrera said, is highly unlikely. So the focus is on large objects that shouldn't be there.",
      "The boat's submergible robot loaded with cameras can dive to a depth of 60 meters to attempt to identify cars. Ideally, they will try to locate license plates, although visibility could be extremely limited and the cars could be smashed to bits or engulfed in the muck, Carrera said.",
      "In the longer term, he said his team will also evaluate the impact of the flood runoff on the marine ecosystem.",
      "Those findings will contribute to initiatives by other Spanish research centers to study Spain's deadliest floods of the century.",
      "Spain is used to the occasional deadly flood produced by autumn storms. But the drought that has hit the country for the past two years and record hot temperatures helped magnify these floods, scientists say.",
      "Spain's meteorological agency said that the 30.4 inches of rain that fell in one hour in the Valencian town of Turis is an all-time national record.",

      "Toronto \u2014\u00a0A small Canadian town's five recently elected councilors refused to swear an oath of allegiance to Britain's King Charles III during their investiture ceremony on Tuesday, despite it being a legal requirement in the northwestern Yukon territory where Dawson City is located.",
      "Under a regulation in the Yukon's Municipal Act, elected councilors are required to swear an oath of allegiance to the British monarch, who remains the official head of state of Canada despite the colonial-era link no longer giving the king any real power in the country.",
      "The oath of allegiance to the monarch is typically taken by Yukon councilors when they're sworn into office, right after they give the separate oath of office, within 40 days of their election.",
      "If the politicians fail to do so, their election can be declared null and void, resulting in the office being left vacant and potentially leading to a special election, known as a by-election.",
      "Dawson City Mayor Stephen Johnson told CBS News partner network CBC News the decision was made collectively by all the newly elected councilors before the swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday, in support of one new councilor who broached the idea.",
      "\"Early in the morning we all got an email and it was from Darwyn,\" Johnson told CBC News, referring to council member Darwyn Lynn. \"And he said I'm hesitant to sign on to this basically because of background history with [the] Crown and First Nations in Canada.\"",
      "Four of the new councilors present at the meeting on Tuesday did take their oaths of office, with the fifth new member expected to do so after returning from vacation, according to the regional Yukon News outlet. But all five agreed not to take the other oath, pledging allegiance to the British crown.",
      "Yukon Director of Community Affairs Samantha Crosby told the CBC that it's uncommon for a whole group of new councilors to refuse to take the oath of allegiance collectively. She said she'd been in touch with the councilors to find a solution to avoid having to call a by-election for Dawson City that would result in the councilors and the mayor losing their seats.",
      "\"The requirement to swear or affirm the oaths is in the [municipal] act itself, but the prescribed forms are under a regulation within the municipal act,\" Crosby told CBC News. \"So the language that is within the forms is a regulation and not within the actual legislation. To make changes to legislation is a very long process, but to make changes to a regulation is something that can be done in a much quicker fashion.\"",

    "summary": "A Qantas plane made an emergency landing after returning to Sydney Airport in Australia shortly after taking off after an engine failed, the airline said.",
    "story": [
      "A Qantas plane made an emergency landing Friday due to what the airline said was a \"contained engine failure\" soon after taking off from Sydney Airport, sparking a grassfire on a nearby runway and causing several flights to be diverted.",
      "The Qantas flight, QF520, was bound for Brisbane and was circling for a \"short period of time\" before landing safely back at Sydney Airport, Qantas Chief Pilot Captain Richard Tobiano said in the statement.",
      "There was no initial word on the number of people on board.",
      "\"Qantas engineers have conducted a preliminary inspection of the engine and confirmed it was a contained engine failure,\" the airline said. \"While customers would have heard a loud bang, there was not an explosion.\"",
      "The Reuters news agency explains that in a contained engine failure, the engine's parts stay inside the protective housing meant to keep them from flying out. If they do, they could cause severe damage to the main body of a plane.",
      "Airservices Australia, the government's aviation regulator, said the engine failure caused \"a grass area adjacent to the runway to catch fire\" that was swiftly extinguished by firefighters.",
      "The Airservices' National Operations Management Centre enacted a 47-minute ground stop at Sydney Airport to ensure the plane could land as quickly as possible, the regulator said in a statement, adding that no one was hurt.",
      "Reuters reports that the airport said all its runways had re-opened by Friday afternoon after the parallel runway had been closed for inspection because of the fire.",
      "The aircraft is a 19-year-old Boeing 737-800, Reuters said, citing Flightradar24. That type of twin-engine passenger plane is designed to be able to fly using only one engine in an emergency, Reuters noted.",
      "Passenger Georgina Lewis said she heard a \"bang.\"",
      "\"One of the engines appeared to have gone. The pilot came on 10 minutes later to explain that they had a problem with a right-hand engine on takeoff,\" she told local outlet Channel Nine.",
      "Another passenger, Mark Willacy, a journalist with Australia's national broadcaster ABC, said the plane struggled to get airborne following the \"loud bang\" noise.",
      "\"That big bang as the wheels were leaving the ground and the shudder, that was like nothing I have ever felt,\" he told ABC. \"When we landed, there was a lot of applause and cheering amongst the passengers.\"",
      "Tobiano said his staff members were \"highly trained\" to respond to such emergency situations.",
      "\"We understand this would have been a distressing experience for customers and we will be contacting all customers this afternoon to provide support,\" he said in the statement. \"We will also be conducting an investigation into what caused the engine issue.\"",
      "Customers were being moved to alternate flights, Qantas said.",
      "Eleven domestic flights were cancelled and four diverted to other airports, a Sydney Airport spokesperson said.",

    "summary": "Israeli and Dutch leaders have condemned a mass attack on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam as clear and violent antisemitism.",
    "story": [
      "Amsterdam \u2014 Antisemitic rioters \"actively sought out Israeli supporters to attack and assault them\" after a soccer match in Amsterdam, authorities in the Netherlands said Friday, with police reporting five people hospitalized and dozens detained after a night of violence that the mayor said had shamed the city. The police did not mention the nationality of any of those injured or arrested after the unrest in the Dutch capital.",
      "The five people treated in the hospital were released, while some 20 to 30 people suffered light injuries, police said. At least 62 suspects were arrested, with 10 still in custody, the city's public prosecutor, Ren\u00e9 de Beukelaer, told reporters at a news conference Friday.",
      "The attacks were condemned as antisemitic by authorities in Amsterdam, Israel and across Europe. In the U.S., President Biden said antisemitism must be fought wherever it emerges.",
      "\"The Antisemitic attacks on Israeli soccer fans in Amsterdam are despicable and echo dark moments in history when Jews were persecuted,\" Mr. Biden said on social media. \"We've been in touch with Israeli and Dutch officials and appreciate Dutch authorities' commitment to holding the perpetrators accountable. We must relentlessly fight Antisemitism, wherever it emerges.\"",
      "Police said security will be beefed up at Jewish institutions across the city, which has a large Jewish community and was home to Jewish World War II diarist Anne Frank and her family as they hid from Nazi occupiers.",
      "The Israeli government said it was \"doing everything to ensure the safety and security of our citizens who were brutally attacked in the horrific anti-Semitic incident in Amsterdam,\" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement. \"It was decided that it was not necessary to send a professional rescue mission to the Netherlands. Instead, the effort will be focused on providing civil aviation solutions for the recovery of our citizens.\"",
      "Israel's airports authority said a plane sent to Amsterdam to bring Israeli citizens back home after the violence had arrived back at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv Friday afternoon. Israel's government initially ordered two planes, but Netanyahu's office later said it would work to help citizens arrange commercial flights.",
      "Condemnation of the violence poured in from around Europe. \"Antisemitism has absolutely no place in Europe, and we are determined to fight it and to fight all forms of hatred,\" said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. \"We want Jewish life and culture to thrive in Europe.\"",
      "Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof described the violence Friday as a \"terrible antisemitic attack\" and declared himself \"deeply ashamed.\"",
      "\"We will not tolerate (it). We will prosecute the perpetrators,\" said Schoof. \"I'm deeply ashamed that this could happen in the Netherlands in 2024.\"",
      "The worst of the attacks on fans of soccer club Maccabi Tel Aviv reportedly came after a Europa League match between their team and the local Amsterdam team Ajax, but there had been clashes between the Israeli fans and locals before the game, too.",
      "The violence erupted despite a ban on a pro-Palestinian demonstration near the soccer stadium imposed by Amsterdam Mayor Femke Halsema, who'd feared clashes would break out between protesters and supporters of the Israeli club.",
      "\"This is a very dark moment for the city, for which I am deeply ashamed,\" Halsema said at a news conference on Friday. \"Anti-semitic criminals attacked and assaulted visitors to our city, in hit-and-run actions.\"",
      "There were clashes before the game, too, as Maccabi fans were among hundreds to march through central Amsterdam in a pro-Israel demonstration, during which flares were lit and Palestinian flags hung on some streets were torn down amid chants of \"death to the Arabs.\" Anger rose as Israeli supporters disrespected a moment of silence.",
      "Afterward, youths on scooters and on foot crisscrossed the city in search of Israeli fans, punching and kicking them and then fleeing quickly to evade police, Halsema said.",
      "As CBS News correspondent Ramy Inocencio reports, bloody brawls between rival fans around soccer games in Europe \u2014 so called hooliganism \u2014 are not new, but since the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack by Hamas and other militants sparked the still-raging war that has killed tens of thousands of people, antisemitism has surged across the continent and beyond.",
      "Maccabi's CEO, Ben Mansford, spoke to reporters at Israel's international airport as some fans returned. \"Lots of people went to watch a football game ... to support Israel, to support the star of David,\" he said. For them to be attacked, \"that's very sad times for us all given the last year we've had.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office barred any members of the country's military from flying to the Netherlands for an indefinite period.",
      "\"The harsh pictures of the assault on our citizens in Amsterdam will not be overlooked,\" Netanyahu's office said, adding that Israel's government \"views the premeditated antisemitic attack against Israeli citizens with utmost gravity.\"",
      "Netanyahu's office demanded the Dutch government take \"vigorous and swift action\" against those involved.",
      "Schoof said on social media that he followed reports of the violence \"with horror.\"",
      "\"Completely unacceptable antisemitic attacks on Israelis. I am in close contact with everyone involved,\" he added, saying he'd spoken with Netanyahu and \"emphasized that the perpetrators will be tracked down and prosecuted. It is now quiet in the capital.\"",
      "In a social media  post, Israeli President Isaac Herzog denounced the attacks as a \"pogrom,\" referring to the historic racist attacks on Jews in Russia and eastern Europe, and said they were reminiscent of the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.",
      "The Israeli Embassy in Washington said on social media that \"hundreds\" of Maccabi fans were \"ambushed and attacked in Amsterdam tonight as they left the stadium following a game,\" according to AFP. The embassy blamed the violence on a \"mob who targeted innocent Israelis.\"",
      "Geert Wilders, the far-right nationalist lawmaker whose Party for Freedom won elections in the Netherlands last year and who's a staunch ally of Israel, reacted to a video apparently showing a Maccabi fan being surrounded by several men.",

      "Payne, 31, died on October 16 when he fell from a balcony of the Casa Sur Palermo hotel in Buenos Aires.",
      "One person, who authorities say spent time with Payne every day while he was in Buenos Aires, is charged with abandonment of a person followed by death, a charge that carries a sentence of five to 15 years in prison, according to a\u00a0news release\u00a0from Argentina's National Criminal and Correctional Prosecutor's Office released Thursday.",
      "The other two charged are accused of supplying Payne with drugs, including cocaine, and have been charged with two acts each of supplying narcotics. Officials did not say what the sentence for those charges could be.",
      "One of the people charged with supplying narcotics is a hotel employee, the prosecutor's office said. The three people charged have been notified of the charges, the prosecutor's office said, and have been prohibited from leaving the country.",
      "None of the suspects were identified by name.",
      "The release also stated that Payne died from a fall, and had not jumped from the balcony. Officials had not previously confirmed which version of events had happened, but the prosecutor's office said that Payne was likely \"not fully conscious or was experiencing a state of noticeable decrease or loss of consciousness\" at the time of the fall.",
      "\"For the prosecution, this situation would also rule out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act on the part of the victim,\" the prosecutor's office said.",
      "The investigation included nine raids on homes in the region and dozens of interviews with hotel staff, Payne's family and friends and experts in the fields of medicine, biochemistry and psychiatry, the prosecutor's office said. Investigators also reviewed more than 800 hours of video footage from the hotel and public roads and conducted a forensic analysis of Payne's cell phone to review his digital footprint in the period leading up to his death.",
      "An autopsy was also conducted. After that, Payne's body was returned to his father, Geoff Payne, who had been in Argentina since the day after his son's death.",
      "Toxicology tests conducted as part of the autopsy showed that Payne \"only had traces\" of drug use in his system. There were \"traces\" of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant, the prosecutor's office said. Medical experts found that Payne only had injuries from his fall.",
      "All of the information gathered by investigators was summarized into a 180-page report presented to Judge Laura Bruniard, who oversees criminal cases. Bruniard approved the charges against the three people, but the investigation will continue, the prosecutor's office said, as investigators continue to try to access Payne's other personal devices.",

    "story": [
      "Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced Thursday what he called a \"world-leading\" plan to implement a social media ban for all children under the age of 16. While much of the detail of the proposed legislation has yet to be made clear, the Australian leader said at a news conference that the bill involves an age verification process where \"the onus will be on social media platforms to demonstrate they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access\" to their platforms.",
      "Under the proposed legislation, social media companies would face sizable fines for allowing younger children to access their platforms, but there would be no penalties for users or parents of users who ignore the law, the Australian government\u00a0said in a statement.",
      "\"Social media is doing harm to our kids and I'm calling time on it,\" Albanese declared Thursday. \"I've spoken to thousands of parents, grandparents, aunties and uncles. They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online, and I want Australian parents and families to know that the government has your back.\"",
      "The government said the proposed legislation would not allow exemptions for children whose parents consent to their use of social media platforms. The bill also will not include \"grandfathering arrangements\" that could exempt young people who already have social accounts.",
      "Australian Minister of Communications Michelle Rowland told reporters social media companies had been consulted about how to practically enforce such a ban, and she mentioned Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, X and YouTube as platforms that would likely be affected by the legislation.",
      "CBS News has sought comment from all five social media companies about the Australian government's plans.",
      "Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, said in a statement that the company has already created several safety tools for teens on its services.",
      "\"There's a solution that negates many of these concerns and simplifies things immeasurably for parents: parental consent and age verification should happen on the app store. And we think Australia should make it law,\" the company said.",

      "\"The online world is a place where children and young people access information, build social and technical skills, connect with family and friends, learn about the world around them and relax and play,\" the letter says. \"We are concerned that a 'ban' is too blunt an instrument to address risks effectively.\"",

    "summary": "Victims thought to be female were male and not related to one another, showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, researchers said.",
    "story": [
      "When a volcanic eruption buried the ancient city of Pompeii, the last desperate moments of its citizens were preserved in stone for centuries.",
      "Observers see stories in the plaster casts later made of their bodies, like a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they die.",
      "But new DNA evidence suggests things were not as they seem \u2014 and these prevailing interpretations come from looking at the ancient world through modern eyes.",
      "\"We were able to disprove or challenge some of the previous narratives built upon how these individuals were kind of found in relation to each other,\" said Alissa Mittnik of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany. \"It opens up different interpretations for who these people might have been.\"",
      "Mittnik and her colleagues discovered that the person thought to be a mother was actually a man unrelated to the child. And at least one of the two people locked in an embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter - was a man. Their research was published Thursday in the journal Current Biology.",
      "The team, which also includes scientists from Harvard University and the University of Florence in Italy, relied on genetic material preserved for nearly two millennia. After Mount Vesuvius erupted and destroyed the Roman city in 79 A.D., bodies buried in mud and ash eventually decomposed, leaving spaces where they used to be. Casts were created from the voids in the late 1800s.",
      "Researchers focused on 14 casts undergoing restoration, extracting DNA from the fragmented skeletal remains that mixed with them. They hoped to determine the sex, ancestry and genetic relationships between the victims.",
      "There were several surprises in \"the house of the golden bracelet,\" the dwelling where the assumed mother and child were found. The adult wore an intricate piece of jewelry, for which the house was named, reinforcing the impression that the victim was a woman. Nearby were the bodies of another adult and child thought to be the rest of their nuclear family.",
      "DNA evidence showed the four were male and not related to one another, clearly showing \"the story that was long spun around these individuals\" was wrong, Mittnik said.",
      "Researchers also confirmed Pompeii citizens came from diverse backgrounds but mainly descended from eastern Mediterranean immigrants \u2013 underscoring a broad pattern of movement and cultural exchange in the Roman Empire. Pompeii is located about 150 miles (241 kilometers) from Rome.",
      "The study builds upon research from 2022 when scientists sequenced the genome of a Pompeii victim for the first time and confirmed the possibility of retrieving ancient DNA from the human remains that still exist.",
      "\"They have a better overview of what's happening in Pompeii because they analyzed different samples,\" said Gabriele Scorrano of the University of Rome Tor Vergata, a co-author of that research who was not involved in the current study. \"We actually had one genome, one sample, one shot.\"",
      "Though much remains to be learned, Scorrano said, such genetic brushstrokes are slowly painting a truer picture of how people lived in the distant past.",
      "In August, archaeologists at Pompeii announced they had unearthed the remains of two more victims -- a man and a woman discovered inside what was likely the bedroom of their home, where they'd become trapped as the rest of the structure filled with debris. The woman was found on the bed with a collection of gold, silver and bronze coins, as well as a pair of gold earrings, a pair of pearl earrings and other jewelry.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers won a $700,000 prize for using artificial intelligence to read a 2,000-year-old scroll that was scorched in the Vesuvius eruption.",
      "The Herculaneum papyri consist of about\u00a0800 rolled-up Greek scrolls\u00a0that were carbonized during the 79 CE volcanic eruption that buried the ancient Roman town, according to the organizers of the\u00a0\"Vesuvius Challenge.\"",
      "The scroll's author was \"probably Epicurean philosopher Philodemus,\" writing \"about music, food, and how to enjoy life's pleasures,\" wrote contest organizer\u00a0Nat Friedman\u00a0on social media.",

Trump has been found liable for sexual abuse\u00a0and defamation, and his vice president, former Ohio senator JD Vance, has previously referred to some women as \"childless cat ladies.\" The Harris campaign also ran on a platform of supporting a woman's right to abortion, something that has been jeopardized in many states after the fall of Supreme Court decision\u00a0Roe v. Wade, which Trump has taken credit for.",

      "The movement specifically calls for the refusal of dating men (biyeonae), sexual relationships with men (bisekseu), heterosexual marriage (bihon), and childbirth (bichulsan) in response to what South Korean women see as a patriarchal and misogynistic culture. The movement is also known as the \"4 Nos.\"",
      "The 4B movement began in 2017 and gained more attention in 2019, amid a\u00a0#MeToo-style reckoning in South Korea. Much of the movement has been built online, where participants call themselves \"anonymous women\" and share few personal details. It has no official leadership structure.",
      "Women in the nation have fought against what Human Rights Watch calls \"shockingly widespread\" gender-based violence and called for harsher penalties for what's called \"spy cam porn.\" They have also criticized the country's extreme gender wage gap, which saw women paid 31.2% less than men in 2022, according to the KoreaTimes, and called out hiring discrimination and harassment in the workplace.",
      "What impact has the 4B movement had in South Korea?",
      "The 4B movement has been controversial in South Korea. The country's president Yoon Suk-yeol said in 2021 that feminist movements were \"blocking healthy relationships\" between men and women in the nation.",
      "The nation has been battling a declining birth rate for several years, which some credit to the 4B movement, according to The New York Times.",

      "Since the election, multiple far-right figures have made alarming statements about women's rights on social media. White nationalist Nick Fuentes, who dined with Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2022, wrote \"Your body, my choice. Forever.\" in a widely-criticized post on X.

    "story": [
      "Berlin\u00a0\u2014   German authorities have detained a U.S. citizen on suspicion of attempting to pass sensitive information about American military operations in Germany to Chinese intelligence agencies. The suspect has been identified only as Martin D., under German privacy laws. He is a 37-year-old former civilian contractor employed by the U.S. military who was arrested by the German Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) Thursday morning in Frankfurt, according to the Federal Prosecutor's Office.",
      "The case is being investigated by the federal prosecutor's office, which ordered the arrest on a warrant issued on Oct. 30 by a federal judge.",
      "\"Due to a pressing suspicion, the accused stands charged with offering himself as an agent to a foreign intelligence service,\" the prosecutor's office said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Martin D. is accused of contacting Chinese government authorities earlier this year, offering to share confidential information he acquired during his work with the U.S. military in Germany. His former employment involved working as a civilian contractor for a private firm that provided services to American forces based in the central state of Hessen, where Frankfurt is located.",
      "Investigators believe Martin D. initiated contact with Chinese intelligence operatives, proposing to hand over classified information about the U.S. military presence and operations within Germany. The prosecutor's statement said he was \"urgently suspected of having expressed a willingness to conduct intelligence activities for a foreign intelligence service.\"",
      "In response to a potential national security threat, German counter-intelligence launched an investigation, with the BKA leading the operation. Martin D.'s residence was searched as part of the operation but authorities have not said what, if any, materials were seized.",
      "The investigation was launched based on initial information gathered by Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), which has been increasing vigilance against foreign intelligence activities within the country.",
      "The arrest comes amid growing concern in Western capitals about espionage and sabotage activities by foreign powers, particularly China and Russia. Just days ago, a source familiar with the matter  that American and European law enforcement agencies were jointly investigating whether incendiary devices that detonated in July at DHL logistics hubs in Germany and the U.K. were part of a larger operation directed by Russia's military intelligence agency.",
      "Martin D. was scheduled to be brought before a judge at the German Federal Court of Justice Thursday. The judge was to formally present the arrest warrant and decide whether the accused can be held in pre-trial detention.",
      "Several people have been arrested in Germany this year and accused of spying for China. In April, federal prosecutors detained three Germans in D\u00fcsseldorf and Bad Homburg who have been accused of passing military technology information. Another high-profile case involved the arrest of a former assistant to far-right AfD party politician Maximilian Krah, who's accused of sharing EU Parliament data and surveilling Chinese dissidents in Germany.",
      "In early October, a Chinese woman working for a logistics company at Leipzig/Halle Airport was also detained on suspicion of espionage. She is accused of providing the former Krah associate with information about flights, cargo and passengers, particularly regarding military goods and individuals linked to a German defense firm.",
      "If convicted, Martin D. could face serious charges under German laws on espionage and unauthorized intelligence activities that carry lengthy prison sentences.",

    "story": [
      "Police in a southern Mexico region rife with drug cartel violence have found 11 bodies, including two of minors, dumped by a highway, prosecutors in the state of Guerrero said Thursday.",
      "The bodies were found late Wednesday after police received a tip about an abandoned pickup truck on the main thoroughfare of the city of Chilpancingo, the state capital, prosecutors said in a news release. The city of 300,000 has been the scene of gruesome drug gang violence as two rival cartels fight for control of the area.",
      "Prosecutors did not specify the ages of the two dead minors but said that two of the 11 bodies were female. The highway where they were found is also the main route between Mexico City and the resort of Acapulco.",
      "In early October, the city's mayor was killed and beheaded just a week after he took office. Alejandro Arcos took office on Oct. 1 in Chilpancingo, and his beheaded body was found in a pickup truck a week later, his head placed on the vehicle's roof. Days later, four mayors asked federal authorities for protection.",

      "For the last six years, Mexico bragged about its oft-questioned \"hugs, not bullets\" strategy, in which its leaders avoided confrontations with drug cartels that were gradually taking control of large parts of the country. The thinking was that social programs, not shootouts, would gradually drain the pool of cartel gunmen.",
      "Now, a month into the term of new President Claudia Sheinbaum, a string of bloody confrontations suggests the government is quietly abandoning the \"no bullets\" part of that strategy and is much more willing to use the full force of the military and the militarized National Guard.",
      "But the challenge Mexico now faces is different from that during the country's 2006-2012 drug war. Cartels today are more diversified, more deeply entrenched in migrant smuggling and more willing to use foreign recruits and adolescents to fill their ranks.",
      "All of that has led to a string of violent clashes in which security forces who shoot at suspected drug cartel convoys wind up killing bystanders and migrants, and reporting lopsided death tolls in which soldiers aren't harmed but most of the suspects are wiped out.",
      "Sheinbaum has studiously avoided using the \"hugs, not bullets\" slogan popularized by her predecessor and mentor, L\u00f3pez Obrador. She has, after all, pledged to continue each and every one of L\u00f3pez Obrador's policies. Her office did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "But Sheinbaum has had to perform some verbal gymnastics to avoid disowning the policy entirely.",
      "\"Clearly, it isn't a question of hugs for criminals, nobody has ever said that,\" Sheinbaum said soon after taking office. The hugs, she said, were meant for impoverished youths, to avoid having them recruited as cartel gunmen.",
      "\"There are traces of a change in tone toward organized crime, but it's too early to call,\" said Falko Ernst, a security analyst. \"It seems unlikely that the Sheinbaum administration would risk a politically inconvenient, steady stream of violent imagery by betting on wholesale balazos (bullets)-only strategy,\" but there may be more willingness to confront \"the most overt and brazen displays of power\" by the cartels.",

    "summary": "Israeli ground forces have \"started to operate\" around a northern Gaza town, expanding an anti-Hamas offensive that will apparently see residents kept out indefinitely.",
    "story": [
      "The Israeli military announced Thursday an expansion of its month-old ground operation in northern Gaza to include part of Beit Lahiya, a town that has been heavily bombed since the earliest days of the war, where Israel says Hamas militants have regrouped.",
      "The military said in a statement that \"troops started to operate\" in the area of Beit Lahiya after intelligence indicated the presence of militants there. Hamas has repeatedly regrouped in areas where the military already conducted major operations.",
      "The town in the northwestern corner of Gaza was among the first targets of the ground invasion launched over a year ago, after Hamas' attack into southern Israel. The northern third of the territory has been encircled by Israeli forces since then.",
      "Israel launched another major offensive in nearby Jabaliya, a decades-old urban refugee camp, in early October. It has sharply restricted the amount of aid entering northern Gaza and ordered a full evacuation. Tens of thousands have fled to nearby Gaza City in the latest mass displacement of the war.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war began after Palestinian militants stormed into Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people - mostly civilians \u2014 and abducting 250 others. Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 43,000 people, Palestinian health officials say. They do not distinguish between civilians and combatants, but say more than half of those killed were women and children.",
      "Palestinian medical sources told the Al Jazeera network that about 20 people were killed Thursday alone in northern Gaza amid the expanding Israeli operations in Beit Lahiya, including five people killed and five others wounded in a raid on a house in the town.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said Thursday that it was continuing to facilitate \"the safe evacuation of Palestinians from combat zones in northern Gaza through organized routes for their safety,\" after an IDF commander said the military was working to displace all civilians from the north of the war-torn Palestinian territory indefinitely.",
      "Briefing journalists Tuesday night, Brigadier General Itzik Cohen, who commands the IDF's 162nd Division operating in Gaza, said that since troops had been forced to enter some areas twice, including the Jabaliya camp, \"there is no intention of allowing the residents of the northern Gaza Strip to return to their homes.\"",
      "He said humanitarian aid \u2014 which the Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase the flow of into Gaza \u2014 would be allowed to enter the south of the enclave \"regularly,\" but not the north, as there were, he said, \"no more civilians left.\"",
      "According to a United Nations estimate, however, \"between 75,000 and 95,000 people were estimated to remain in North Gaza\" as of Monday.",
      "The U.N.'s humanitarian agency OCHA said roughly 100,000 people had been forced to flee the region since Israel launched its offensive in northern Gaza, and \"the death toll in the North Gaza governorate over the past month is thought to be in the hundreds, possibly over 1,000.\"",
      "The U.N. agency said in July that 1.9 million Gaza residents had been forcibly displaced from their homes.",
      "\"In other words, approximately nine out of ten people in Gaza are now estimated to be internally displaced, many multiple times,\" the U.N.'s humanitarian agency said.",

      "No sign of letup in Israel's parallel war with Hezbollah",
      "Several large Israeli airstrikes hit Beirut's southern suburbs early Thursday, including one on a site adjacent to Lebanon's only international airport. The Israeli military had issued an evacuation notice for the site, saying there were Hezbollah facilities there, without giving more details.",
      "Hezbollah leader Naim Kassem said in a speech aired Wednesday that the Lebanese militant group is open for cease-fire negotiations only once \"the enemy stops its aggression.\" His speech marked the 40-day mourning period since former Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah was assassinated in Beirut.",
      "Hezbollah began firing into Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, in solidarity with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Both groups are considered proxy forces backed by Iran, which insisted Thursday that despite Israel killing many top commanders, its \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israel remained robust. Since the conflict erupted, more than 3,000 people have been killed and some 13,600 wounded in Lebanon, according to the country's health ministry.",
      "Lebanon's state news agency said an Israeli drone strike hit a car at an army checkpoint in the southern port city of Sidon, killing three people and wounding several others, including U.N. peacekeepers based in southern Lebanon. The National News Agency said one of the wounded was taken to the hospital while the peacekeepers were treated for minor injuries at the scene of the attack at the northern entrance of Sidon, Lebanon's third-largest city. There was no immediate information on the identities of those who died.",
      "The U.N. peacekeeping force in the country, UNIFIL, said in a statement that a convoy \"bringing newly-arrived peacekeepers to south Lebanon was passing Saida when a drone strike occurred nearby\" lightly wounding five peacekeepers, whom it said were treated by Lebanese Red Cross medics on the spot.",
      "\"They will continue to their posts,\" UNFIL said of the troops in the convoy, adding: \"We remind all actors of their obligation to avoid actions putting peacekeepers or civilians in danger. Differences should be resolved at the negotiating table, not through violence.\"",

    "summary": "An environmental agency says black balls that washed up on Sydney beaches aren't tar, but a \"complex composition\" of \"mixed waste.\"",
    "story": [
      "Environmental officials in Australia still haven't completely solved the mystery of black balls found littering popular beaches on the country's eastern coastline, but they're getting closer. The New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority said Wednesday that the composition of the mysterious globs had been determined \u2014 and it's not pretty \u2014 but their origin remains unclear.",
      "The golf-to-baseball sized balls \u2014 the appearance of hundreds of which forced the closure of two beaches near Sydney last month \u2014 are not, the agency said, tar balls as initially suspected. Or at least not simple tar balls from oil out at sea.",
      "They're more likely to be sewage-trash balls.",
      "According to the EPA's analysis, \"the balls comprised fatty acids, petroleum hydrocarbons, and other organic and inorganic materials.\" In plain English, that means a mix of cooking oils and fats, cleaning and skincare products, hair, food waste, oil and gas and any number of other things that people routinely flush, dump or wash down drains and storm grates.",
      "\"The investigation has revealed that the balls contain hundreds to thousands of different materials, including human hair and various fibres, indicating they likely originated from a source that releases mixed waste,\" the agency concluded.",
      "But officials still couldn't say where the mix of materials came from.",
      "The EPA said it looked at \"several possible causes, such as a shipping spill or wastewater outflow,\" but that due to \"the complex composition of the balls and the time they have spent in the water, testing has not been able to confirm their exact origin.\"",
      "It said the regional water company, Sydney Water, reported \"no issues with the operation or maintenance\" at two nearby treatment facilities when asked soon after the balls appeared. A review of data by the state maritime meteorological agency yielded \"nothing conclusive\" about where they might have washed up from.",
      "While the EPA said it was waiting for the final results of its tests on the mystery balls, the agency has separately been pushing for greater efforts to clean up the Sydney area, which it warned was quickly filling up with residents' trash.",
      "\"Greater Sydney is on the brink of a waste crisis, with landfill space expected to run out by 2030 unless urgent action is taken,\" the EPA said in a Nov. 1 social media post, heralding a Circular Economy Summit of government, industrial and environmental officials \"to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the NSW waste sector.\"",
      "Officials explained that the concept of a circular economy is one that \"keeps products and materials in use for as long as possible and reduces the need for new materials,\" to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills \u2014 waste that, if it overwhelms the available landfill space, could be washed into water ways and then carried into the ocean.",
      "The black balls first started showing up on the Coogee and Gordon's Bay beaches near Sydney in mid-October, the local mayor said at the time, suggesting they could be tar balls, which often form at sea after an oil spill or leak.",
      "Authorities closed those beaches, along with Sydney's famed Bondi Beach and several others in the area, while cleanup operations continued. All the beaches were reopened after several days, based on authorities saying there were few or no more balls washing up, and a determination that they were \"not highly toxic to humans.\"",

      "For decades, scientists have warned that average global temperatures should not get any higher than 1.5 C above pre-industrial times in order to prevent deadly weather conditions that could impact people worldwide.",
      "The world has already warmed considerably and has seen the effects with back-to-back heat waves, droughts and\u00a0unprecedented flooding and hurricane events. The way farmers are able to grow food has already started to shift, and with\u00a01.5 to 2 degrees Celsius of warming, agricultural yields will decline and sea levels could rise up to 10 feet, researchers have found. Experts say the oceans will also be warmer, fueling more powerful hurricanes and threatening ecosystems that are fundamental for economies and help protect areas from inclement weather.",
      "\"This marks a new milestone in global temperature records and should serve as a catalyst to raise ambition for the upcoming Climate Change Conference, COP29,\" said Samantha Burgess, deputy director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, in a statement.",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service said the average global temperature anomaly for the first 10 months of 2024 (January to October) is 0.71 C above the 1991-2020 average, which is the highest on record for this period and 0.16 C warmer than the same period in 2023.",
      "\"The average temperature anomaly for the rest of 2024 would have to drop to almost zero for 2024 to not be the warmest year,\" the agency said.",
      "The agency added that given that 2023 was 1.48\u00b0C above the pre-industrial level according to its ERA5 model, it was also likely that the annual temperature for 2024 will be more than 1.55\u00b0C above.",
      "European temperatures were above average over almost all of the continent, Copernicus found. Outside Europe, temperatures were most above average over northern Canada, and well-above average over the central and western United States, northern Tibet, Japan and Australia.",
      "The agency also said Arctic sea ice reached its fourth lowest monthly extent for October, at 19% below average. Sea ice extent is a measure of the surface area of the ocean which is covered by ice.",
      "Sea ice concentration anomalies were well below average in all peripheral seas of the Arctic Ocean, particularly in the Barents Sea, Canadian Archipelago, and north of Svalbard, the agency said.",
      "Antarctic sea ice extent was 8% below average in October, which was the second-lowest such average behind only October 2023, when it was 11% below average, Copernicus said. Those numbers continued \"a series of large negative anomalies observed throughout 2023 and 2024.\"",
      "The Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is funded by the EU, routinely publishes monthly climate bulletins reporting on changes observed in global surface air and sea temperatures, sea ice cover and hydrological variables. All the reported findings are based on computer-generated analyses and the ERA5 dataset, which uses billions of measurements from satellites, ships, aircraft and weather stations around the world.",
      "In a\u00a0report\u00a0published last month, the United Nations warned that the world is now in \"climate crunch time\" as greenhouse gases \u2014 which trap heat in the atmosphere that warms global temperatures and fuels more extreme weather events \u2014 have hit \"unprecedented levels.\"",
      "\"The numbers paint a clear picture,\" the U.N. said. \"To keep emissions below the\u00a0critical 1.5-degree target\u00a0set in Paris in 2015, countries must cut emissions by 42 percent overall by 2030 and achieve a 57 percent reduction by 2035.\"",

      "Within days of the deals becoming public this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. Plea bargains in possible death penalty cases tied to one of the gravest crimes ever carried out on U.S. soil were a momentous step that should only be decided by the defense secretary, Austin said at the time.",

    "summary": "The mystery song is called \"Subways of Your Mind,\" and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
    "story": [
      "For the last 17 years, a worldwide army of online sleuths obsessively tried to figure out the title of what has been dubbed \"the most mysterious song on the internet.\"",
      "Now, they have the answer after a chance discovery by one intrepid researcher who triumphantly reported his breakthrough on online forum Reddit: it is called \"Subways of Your Mind\"\u00a0and was recorded by a little-known 1980s German band called FEX.",
      "The former band members are \"absolutely overwhelmed\" by the news, 68-year-old Michael Haedrich, who played keyboard and guitar and sang back-up vocals for FEX, told Der Spiegel magazine.",
      "The band had been oblivious to the online phenomenon, he admitted.",
      "How the mystery unfolded",
      "The mystery began in 2007, when a German brother and sister uploaded a track online that they had digitized after originally recording it as teenagers on a cassette from the radio. As Rolling Stone\u00a0reported in 2019, the tape mostly featured songs from popular bands like XTC and The Cure, as well as one particular song that remained a mystery \u2014 until now.",
      "The German siblings asked for help to identify it and audiophiles soon took up the challenge.",
      "The track did not show up in any music databases, but online sleuths tried to work out what instruments could be heard and analyzed the lead singer's accent.",
      "Initial attempts to identify the song, soon classified by many as being in the 1980s' \"New Wave\" genre, yielded little.",
      "It was only when the track was uploaded onto Reddit in 2019 that global interest exploded.",
      "A Reddit subforum called \"r/TheMysteriousSong\" attracted tens of thousands of members, and the hunt was reported on in German media and beyond.",
      "The big breakthrough finally came earlier this week when a user called \"marijn1412\" said he had identified the song as \"Subways of Your Mind.\"",
      "He said he came across former FEX members while researching an event for up-and-coming bands that had been organized in the 1980s by a public broadcaster in northern Germany.",
      "The Reddit user wrote that he had reached out to members of what was a four-piece outfit from the northern city of Kiel, who sent him a version of the mystery song, and revealed its long-sought-after name.",
      "Marijn1412 wrote: \"After I emailed him back that the song is actually quite a famous 'lost song,' he asked me not to go public with it until he spoke with his old band members. In the meantime, though, the song did get registered at [the German performance rights organization] GEMA and people found out about it. But I'm happy to say that the band members agreed for me to go public with it.\"",
      "Haedrich, who is still a musician, told Spiegel that it was the first time he had heard about the massive search effort.",
      "\"I thought it was amazing that someone was interested in music by a band that was only successful regionally, if at all, and that was over 40 years ago,\" he said.",
      "Haedrich, who lives in Munich, said the band members now want to reissue \"Subways of Your Mind\" and are trying to track down the original recording of the song.",
      "Their success may have been decades in the making, but he said \"for us, it has just come suddenly.\"",

      "According to Wednesday's release, \"the results of the toxicological studies \u2014 already communicated to his family \u2014 revealed that, in the moments prior to his death and in the period of at least his last 72 hours, Payne only presented traces of polydrug use of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant in his body. This conclusion was reached after complete toxicological analyses on urine, blood and vitreous humor, carried out in a very short time.\"",
      "Additionally, the release states, \"the lack of defense or self-preservation reflex in the fall, together with other relevant data due to his consumption, allow us to conclude that Liam Payne was not fully conscious or was going through a state of noticeable decrease or abolition of consciousness at the time of the fall.\"",
      "The autopsy was reportedly completed and concluded and \"the delivery of the body to the father of the deceased, Geoff Payne\" was carried out last weekend.",
      "Payne had one child, a 7-year-old son, Bear, with ex-girlfriend Cheryl Cole.",
      "Per the release, the investigation is ongoing, stating: \"Beyond the evidentiary forcefulness that was achieved so far (visual, registry, medical, scientific, documentary, telephone, testimonial, etc.), the investigation must continue, since, among other procedures, the unlocking of the victim's personal netbook \u2014 which is broken \u2014 and other devices seized in the investigation are still ongoing.\"",

We want to actually try to prevent the flow of illegal immigration, we want to go after the cartels to prevent the drugs from, you know, making it to our border.

That's the same methodology, same strategy that we used in the first Trump administration that led to the most secure border in our lifetime,\" he said.",

      "Data theft and ransomware attacks against health care and critical third-party providers are still happening at an alarmingly high rate in 2024, which is shaping up to be as severe as last year, the worst on record for health care breaches.",

      "Impact of ransomware on health care",
      "Microsoft points out that beyond the financial risk to health care organizations, ransomware attacks can have life-threatening consequences. When health care providers lose access to diagnostic equipment or patient records due to ransomware, patient care is severely disrupted. For example, stroke code activations are nearly double during hospital attacks, with confirmed strokes increasing by 113.6%, and cardiac arrest cases rise by 81% and survival rates drop from 40% to just 4.5%.",
      "Health care facilities near hospitals hit by ransomware attacks also feel the impact, facing a surge in patients needing urgent care that they may not be equipped to handle. As a result, patients often face longer wait times.",
      "What\u2019s more troubling is that these attacks aren\u2019t limited to urban areas. Rural health clinics are also prime targets for cyberattacks. These facilities are particularly vulnerable to ransomware because they often lack the resources to prevent or respond to security incidents. And since these clinics are the only health care option within miles, a successful attack can be devastating for many rural communities.",

      "HEALTH CARE RANSOMWARE ATTACK EXPOSES PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION OF OVER 100 MILLION",

      "Ransomware attacks on health care have shot up 300% since 2015, making it one of the top 10 most targeted industries in the second quarter of 2024. This rise is mostly because health care organizations store extremely sensitive data, and hackers know there\u2019s big money to be made. With lives on the line, hospitals can\u2019t risk poor patient outcomes if their systems go down or the exposure of patient data if they don\u2019t pay. This reputation for paying ransoms just makes health care an even bigger target.",
      "Some of the blame also falls on health care organizations. They tend to have lower cybersecurity budgets compared to other industries, making it harder to defend against these kinds of attacks. Many facilities don\u2019t have staff dedicated to cybersecurity; some don\u2019t even have a chief information security officer or a security operations center. Instead, cybersecurity often gets lumped in with regular IT duties. Plus, doctors, nurses and other health care staff might not get any cybersecurity training, so they might not even recognize a\u00a0phishing email when they see one.",

      "5. Be vigilant against phishing: Cyberattacks often result in a spike in phishing emails and calls as attackers exploit the situation. Protect yourself by using strong antivirus software on all your devices, which can help block malicious links and detect phishing emails. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Confirm appointments: If you have upcoming appointments or procedures, contact your health care provider to confirm or reschedule if a cyberattack disrupts their normal operations.",
      "7. Monitor patient portals: Keep an eye on patient portals like MyChart for updates on your medical records and communication with health care providers, as these can provide critical information during service disruptions.",

      "The surge in ransomware attacks on the health care industry is troubling and a harsh reminder that criminals don\u2019t care about the lives at risk. They\u2019re just after money. Health care organizations need to take lessons from the past two years, investing heavily in cybersecurity infrastructure and hiring dedicated staff to protect patient data and systems. With stronger defenses in place, the goal is to prevent these situations from reaching the point where paying a ransom is even considered.",

If you see such warnings, it\u2019s best to ignore them and avoid clicking on any links or downloading any suggested software. Below are several key steps you can take to secure your iPhone.",
      "1) Keep your iPhone up to date: Occasionally, Apple releases new iOS updates to address known vulnerabilities. When possible, it is best to\u00a0update the iOS so that your iPhone is safe from known vulnerabilities.",
      "2) Install and run strong antivirus software: An antivirus software actively running on all of your devices can help keep them all safe, including your iPhone. With iPhones, strong antivirus software will prevent you from clicking on any malicious links that may then install malware onto your devices, which can potentially extract personal information from your device. Avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading attachments from unknown sources. These can be phishing attempts designed to steal your personal information.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "3) Download apps only from the App Store: Stick to downloading apps from the official Apple App Store. Apps on the App Store are vetted by Apple for security, reducing the risk of downloading malicious software.",
      "4) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Adding an extra layer of security to your Apple ID can help protect your personal information. With\u00a02FA, even if someone gets your password, they won\u2019t be able to access your account without the second factor.",
      "5) Use strong passwords: Ensure that your passwords are strong and unique for different accounts. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to keep track of them.",
      "6) Monitor app permissions: Regularly check the\u00a0permissions granted to your apps and revoke any that seem unnecessary. This can help prevent apps from accessing more information than they need.",

      "While most iPhone users rest easy knowing that the iOS keeps most common viruses and malware at bay, they are still susceptible to scammers trying to work around the closed code and scaring people into making bad choices that endanger their phones and data. Because Apple never sends out alerts about viruses or malware on your iPhone, it should be the first clue of a scam. Even if it looks official, iPhone users do not get alerts from Apple about viruses or malware. If you do install a good antivirus program, that will be the only program notifying you that there is anything amiss with your iPhone. Understanding these scams can go a long way in keeping you calm and your phone safe.",

      "Common misconceptions",
      "Opening emails can instantly infect your device: One common myth is that simply opening an email can automatically infect your device with malware. In reality, modern email systems (such as Gmail, Outlook, etc.) generally prevent this from happening. The real danger comes from interacting with the content inside the email, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading harmful attachments.",
      "Plain text emails are always safe: While emails in plain text format are generally safer than HTML-based emails, they can still pose a risk if they contain malicious links. Phishing attacks can appear in plain text emails, luring you to dangerous websites.",
      "Emails from known contacts are always safe: Even if an email appears to come from someone you know, that doesn\u2019t always mean it's safe. Attackers can spoof email addresses or hack accounts, so always be cautious about unexpected or unusual messages from known contacts, especially those containing links or attachments.",
      "Spam filters catch all malicious emails: Spam filters are highly effective but not perfect. Some sophisticated phishing and malicious emails can bypass these filters and land in your inbox. This is why it\u2019s important to stay vigilant, even with emails that seem to have passed your email service\u2019s security checks.",
      "Previewing emails is always safe: Most modern email clients use a \"preview\" pane for quick reading. While the risk of malware through previews is significantly reduced in up-to-date systems, embedded trackers or other forms of data collection can still occur, confirming your activity to the spammer. Always disable automatic image loading or other active content features in your email client\u2019s settings to minimize exposure.",

      "As mentioned already, generally, simply opening an email is not enough to cause harm. However, there are some important points to consider:",
      "1) Embedded trackers: Some spam or\u00a0phishing emails contain trackers that can notify the sender when the email is opened. This can confirm to the spammer that your email address is active, potentially leading to more spam.",
      "2) Malicious links and attachments: The real danger lies in clicking on links or downloading attachments within the email. These can lead to malicious websites or download malware onto your device.",
      "3) HTML emails: Emails that contain HTML content can sometimes execute scripts when opened. While modern email clients have protections against this, it\u2019s still a potential risk.",
      "4) Phishing attempts: Even if you don\u2019t click on anything,\u00a0phishing emails can be designed to look very convincing and may trick you into providing personal information if you respond.",

      "3) Enable email filtering: Turn on spam filters to reduce the number of unsolicited or potentially dangerous emails reaching your inbox. This reduces your exposure to phishing attempts. Most email platforms these days automatically filter out what they assume to be \"junk\" into their own folder. If you notice the amount of spam getting through to your inbox increasing, you may want to consider a\u00a0Spam Filter.\u00a0There are free options for different email providers. For Gmail, try\u00a0Mailwasher. For Outlook and Windows Mail, try\u00a0Spam Bully, which costs an annual fee of $29.95.",
      "4) Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your email client and operating system to stay protected from the latest security vulnerabilities that hackers might exploit.",

      "Americans are granted free credit reports every 12 months from the three major consumer reporting companies. Regularly culling through these reports can help you spot potential fraud, which might signal that your Social Security number has been compromised. Any hard inquiries you didn\u2019t request on your credit report are a strong indicator that someone tried to open a credit card or another line of credit with your SSN.",
      "While most people know they should check their credit report and scores, you can see your Social Security statement by creating an account on the official Social Security Administration website. Because only one account can be created per SSN, it is safer if you claim it so that no one else can by piecing together your personal information (along with your SSN) to claim it fraudulently. Make sure it is connected to a secure email account that you check frequently. This account also provides up-to-date data on earnings and benefit distributions so you can see if anything is \"off.\"",

      "While it might seem natural to toss a pile of \"junk\" mailers or ignore calls from random debt collectors or advertisers, it may be an indicator that someone has gotten a hold of your Social Security number and has begun opening accounts under your number. It\u2019s important to make note of the patterns and follow up with these collectors should it become more and more apparent that your SSN might have been misused. Oftentimes, consumers start getting more credit offers when new credit cards are opened. Additionally, if you start receiving bills under someone else\u2019s name at your address, it might be time to follow up with these notices.",
      "If you start receiving notices about your Social Security number being used to file someone else\u2019s taxes or inappropriately use your health insurance, it is definitely a sign that someone may have compromised your SSN. While receiving a notice from the IRS or Medicare can feel scary, it is imperative that you reach out to the corresponding agency to notify them of the fraudulent activity so that you can stop further damage.",

      "Put your Social Security number card in a very safe place, such as a safe, bank safe or a filing cabinet that can be locked. Because it is used so frequently, those nine digits are worth memorizing. If your wallet is lost or stolen, and you keep your SSN card in there, it will be messier than losing just money or your ID. Don\u2019t carry your Social Security card in your wallet or purse.",
      "Skip jotting down your Social Security number on in-person forms. When your SSN is jotted down on paper, it is hard to control how the information gets used or disposed of. If you can submit forms online, you can skip the risk of having your SSN getting into the wrong hands. If you mail in forms that denote your SSN, you risk having that piece of mail stolen or lost.",
      "Even though your SSN is requested on some forms, it is not always necessary. If a future employer is requesting your SSN, double-check why they need it. They would most likely need it to run a background check, which you should know about anyway. Additionally, some establishments allow you to provide the last four digits of your SSN until you are finalizing a screening process, etc.",
      "Open accounts for your children's Social Security numbers because you want to claim them for them early and be able to monitor any movement related to their SSN.",

The malware we\u2019re talking about here is just like that. It\u2019s called FakeCalls, and every time researchers figure out how it infects devices, it evolves with new ways to hide.",

      "What you need to know",
      "FakeCalls is a banking trojan that focuses on voice phishing, where victims are deceived through fraudulent calls impersonating banks and are asked to share sensitive information. Earlier versions did this by prompting users to call the bank from within an app that impersonated the financial institution, as reported by\u00a0Bleeping Computer. However, the latest version, analyzed by\u00a0Zimperium, sets itself as the default call handler.",
      "The default call handler app manages incoming and outgoing calls, allowing users to answer, reject or initiate calls. Giving these permissions to a malicious app, as you can imagine, carries serious risks.",
      "When a user gives the app permission to set itself as the default call handler, the malware gets the green light to intercept and mess with both outgoing and incoming calls. It even shows a fake call interface that looks just like the real Android dialer, complete with trusted contact info and names. This level of deception makes it really tough for victims to see what's happening.",

The developer of the malware has also added several new commands, including the ability to start livestreaming the device's screen, take screenshots, unlock the device if it\u2019s locked and temporarily turn off auto-lock.

Historically, Play Protect hasn\u2019t been 100% foolproof at removing all known malware from Android phones. Also, avoid clicking on any links in messages or emails that seem suspicious. The best way to protect yourself from clicking malicious links that install malware that may get access to your private information is to have antivirus protection installed on all your devices. This can also alert you of any\u00a0phishing emails or\u00a0ransomware scams.",

      "2) Download apps from reliable sources:\u00a0It\u2019s important to download apps only from trusted sources, like the Google Play Store. The FakeCalls malware infects your phone when you download an app from an unknown link. As an Android user, you should only download apps from the Play Store, which has strict checks to prevent malware and other harmful software. Avoid downloading apps from unknown websites or unofficial stores, as they pose a higher risk to your personal data and device. Also, never trust download links that you receive through SMS.",
      "3) Be cautious with app permissions: Always review the permissions requested by apps before installation. If an app requests access to features that seem unnecessary for its function, it could be a sign of malicious intent. Do not give any app Accessibility permissions unless you really need to. Avoid granting permissions that could compromise your personal data.",
      "4) Regularly update your device\u2019s operating system and apps: Keeping your software\u00a0up to date is crucial, as updates often include security patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malware like FakeCalls.",
      "5) Monitor financial activity regularly: Check your bank and credit card statements often for unauthorized transactions. Set up alerts for any account activity, which can notify you immediately if suspicious activity occurs.",
      "6) Limit sensitive transactions on mobile: Whenever possible, avoid performing high-risk transactions (like large money transfers) on your mobile device, especially if you\u2019re in\u00a0public or connected to unsecured Wi-Fi. Use a secure computer or contact your bank directly from a verified number.",

      "The new\u00a0iMac, announced Oct. 28, comes with the M4 chip, featuring an 8-core CPU and up to a 10-core GPU. If you remember\u00a0Apple\u2019s iPad announcement earlier this year, the M4 chip debuted with the iPad Pro (7th generation).",
      "The new\u00a0iMac now comes with accessories that use USB-C charging ports instead of Lightning. All USB-C ports also support the fastest Thunderbolt 4 standard, which means you can transfer large videos and other files faster. The display is still a 24-inch panel with 4.5K resolution, but Apple is now offering a \"nano-texture glass\" option for an extra $200, designed to reduce reflections and glare.",
      "There are a few other updates, too. The base RAM has doubled to 16GB from the previous model, with an option to go up to 32GB on the higher-end version. The new iMac also includes a 12MP webcam and introduces Apple Intelligence features, which are finally rolling out. These include AI-powered writing and editing tools and a redesigned Siri, now powered by ChatGPT.",
      "The\u00a0M4 iMac now comes in new colors, including green, yellow, orange, pink, and purple. Silver remains an option too. It\u2019s available for preorder now, with shipping starting Nov. 8. The entry-level model costs $1,299 and comes with two USB-C ports, while the higher-end models start at $1,499 and include four ports.",

      "Mac Mini also gets an upgrade",
      "As the name suggests, the\u00a0Mac Mini\u00a0is a compact computer that can handle some serious workloads. First announced in 2005, it retained the same design until 2010, but Apple finally changed it with the latest model. They\u2019ve shrunk the case, reducing the computer\u2019s volume by half. The new Mini is now a five-inch by five-inch box that\u2019s just two inches tall, while the older model measures 7.75 inches by 7.75 inches and is 1.41 inches thick.",
      "The main upgrade for the new computer is the inclusion of Apple\u2019s latest chips, either the M4 or a more powerful version called the M4 Pro. The\u00a0M4 Mini\u00a0comes equipped with two USB-C ports and a headphone jack on the front. These front USB-C ports support USB 3, with speeds of up to 10Gbps.",
      "On the back, you\u2019ll find three USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports (up to 40Gbps), along with Ethernet and HDMI connections. The higher-end M4 Pro model also features Thunderbolt 5 connectivity, which offers transfer speeds of up to 120Gbps and the ability to connect up to three displays.",
      "The starting price of the\u00a0Mac Mini remains the same at $599. This baseline model comes with the M4 chip featuring 10 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores, along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. For $799, you can double the SSD to 512GB, while the $999 model bumps the RAM up to 24GB. These are solid prices, which isn\u2019t something I say often about Apple products.",
      "There\u2019s also a $1,399 Mac Mini model that features the new M4 Pro processor, which boasts a 12-core CPU and 16-core GPU. It also supports up to 64GB of RAM and up to an 8TB SSD.",

Announced Oct. 30, the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros are now powered by Apple\u2019s new M4 series processors \u2014 the\u00a0M4 Pro and the even higher-end\u00a0M4 Max. The 14-inch base model now has an extra USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 port on the right side, along with a new space black color option.",

The entry-level 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro still starts at $1,599, but Apple has upped the starting RAM to 16GB (a welcome boost from the previous 8GB).

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Apple\u2019s updates to the Mac lineup bring impressive changes, especially for power users. The new\u00a0iMacs, now powered by the M4 chip, offer serious performance boosts. But if you\u2019re just using an\u00a0iMac for general tasks like browsing or light work, you might be better off with an older model to save some cash. The M4 Mac Mini, though, is a great value option with a competitive price and an extra $100 education discount. For those needing even more power, the new M4 MacBook Pros feature both M4 Pro and M4 Max chips, with base RAM now starting at 24GB on the Pro models and 16GB on the entry-level 14-inch version.",
      "What\u2019s also worth mentioning is Apple Intelligence, which Apple announced way back in May but is only now rolling out. I tried some of these features, and while I found them useful, they\u2019re not exactly earth-shattering.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:25:23 -0500",
    "summary": "To protect a declining bird species, President Biden&apos;s administration has proposed tighter restrictions on energy development across federal land in the U.S. West.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "President Joe Biden's administration on Friday proposed tighter restrictions on oil, solar and wind energy development across more than 6,500 square miles of federal land in the U.S. West to protect a declining bird species.",
      "However, it is doubtful the changes would survive under President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "BIDEN ADMIN EXAMINES NEW MEASURES TO PROTECT BIRD SPECIES",
      "Greater sage grouse \u2014 chicken-sized birds known for an elaborate mating ritual\u2014 were once found across much of the U.S. West. Their numbers plummeted in recent decades because of energy exploration, wildfires, disease and other pressures.",
      "A 2015 agreement shepherded by the Obama administration kept the birds off the endangered species list, by imposing limits on where and when development could occur across their 270,000-square mile range.",
      "Now officials with the Interior Department want to make the protections even stronger. Their plan would eliminate loopholes that allowed development in areas considered crucial to the bird's long-term survival. New solar and wind projects would be excluded, and oil and gas exploration could only occur from drilling platforms located outside the protected areas.",
      "In this May 9, 2008, file photo, male sage grouses fight for the attention of females southwest of Rawlins, Wyo. \u00a0\u00a0 (Jerret Raffety/The Rawlins Daily Times via AP)",
      "Trump has pushed to open more public lands to energy development in line with his mantra to \"drill baby drill.\" During his first administration, officials attempted to scale back the Obama-era sage grouse protections, but they were blocked in court.",
      "Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said Friday's proposal would boost sage grouse while allowing development on some government lands to continue. She said the plan was based on the best science to protect the bird.",
      "\"For too long, a false choice has been presented for land management that aims to pit development against conservation,\" Haaland said in a statement.",
      "Yet the agency's attempt to find a middle ground fell flat with environmentalists, industry representatives and Republican elected officials.",
      "Most of the land at issue \u2014 about 4,700 square miles \u2014 is in Nevada and California, according to government documents. Affected parcels also are in Wyoming, Oregon, Idaho, Colorado, Montana and the Dakotas.",
      "Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon lamented what he called the administration's \"extreme indifference\" to his state. The Republican governor said new layers of federal regulation would hinder practical solutions for the grouse.",
      "\"We have shown how to successfully manage this bird and do so in a way that allows for protection of core habitat alongside responsible development,\" Gordon said.",
      "Environmentalists, meanwhile, said officials had squandered a chance to put in place meaningful protections that could halt the grouse's slow spiral towards extinction. They noted that loopholes allowing development would remain in place across nearly 50,000 square miles of public lands.",
      "\"It's death by a thousands cuts,\" said Greta Anderson with Western Watersheds Project, an environmental group involved in previous sage grouse lawsuits. \"The Biden administration could have stopped the cutting, and it didn't. The fact that it's less bad doesn't mean it's not bad.\"",
      "Federal officials predicted only minimal economic impacts. They said energy companies already steer clear of sage grouse habitat, where there are limits on when and where work can be done near breeding areas. Those companies can still find opportunities on other public lands, the officials said.",
      "That was disputed by an energy industry representative. Kathleen Sgamma with the Western Energy Alliance said the Biden administration already had limited leasing in sage grouse habitat.",
      "\"So they\u2019ve denied access and then say companies are avoiding them anyway,\" Sgamma said. \"That\u2019s disingenuous.\"",
      "The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management will accept protests against Friday's proposal until Dec. 9. Final decisions on changes to the agency's land management plans will be made after the protests are resolved.",
      "A related proposal to help sage grouse would block for 20 years new mining projects on more than 15,625 square miles in Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming. That proposal was part of the 2015 Obama-era protections. It was canceled under Trump then restored by a court.",

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 23:03:58 GMT",
    "summary": "The migrants participated in two Biden programs that created legal pathways to enter the US and punished those who crossed the border illegally.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team is considering ending two Biden administration programs that have allowed more than 1.3 million immigrants to enter the U.S. legally, making those who entered but have not yet received asylum\u00a0eligible for deportation, two sources familiar with the plans told NBC News.",
      "The exact number of people who could face deportation after arriving in the U.S. legally is not known, but it is estimated to be in the hundreds of thousands.",
      "Trump\u2019s plan to end the two Biden programs comes as the president-elect\u2019s\u00a0promised\u00a0plan to carry out mass deportations is taking clearer shape. Trump\u2019s transition team is considering plans designed to maximize the scope of the deportations and prioritize certain immigrants as among the first to be forced to leave.",
      "While those who entered under the programs may be eligible for deportation, the first people likely to be\u00a0targeted are those considered to be threats, possibly including Chinese men who are deemed to be of military age living illegally in the United States, the two sources and a third source familiar with the plan told NBC News. This group would also include convicted criminals who are in the U.S. illegally and those with final orders of deportation, the officials said.",
      "Migrants who arrived in the U.S. legally\u00a0under the\u00a0two Biden administration programs \u2014 CBP One and the Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela (CHNV) parole program \u2014 may be immune from deportation if they have already been granted asylum or are on the path toward it, or have another legal status to stay in the United States.",
      "If not, they may be deported as part of Trump\u2019s plan to dramatically increase the number of migrant deportations.",
      "The sources cautioned, though, that they may not be considered top priorities for deportation after Trump takes office, but could still be deported eventually.",
      "The programs have been a critical part of Biden\u2019s strategy to increase the number of legal pathways for migrants to enter the U.S. while disincentivizing illegal border crossings.",
      "Since the migrants entered the U.S. legally, any attempt by Trump to deport them will likely be challenged in court by various groups.",
      "A spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Legal battles expected",
      "Immigration advocates have applauded the Biden administration programs\u00a0and will likely ask judges to block any deportation plan, just as they asked judges during Trump\u2019s first term to stop his plan to end\u00a0the DACA program for immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.",
      "The Supreme Court struck down the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to end DACA in\u00a02020,\u00a0but that was before the court switched to a conservative supermajority.",
      "One immigration advocate, speaking on the condition of\u00a0anonymity\u00a0because they did not want to discuss potential litigation,\u00a0said the new administration should expect legal challenges.",
      "\u201cIf [Trump] cancels the [CHNV] parole program, what does that mean for people who are already here to revoke their parole? We expect that to be legally difficult,\u201d the advocate said.",
      "Over 531,0000 nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela have entered the U.S. through the CHNV parole program, which was created to allow migrants from those countries to apply for entry from their home countries with the help of a U.S.-based sponsor.",
      "Over 852,000 migrants have entered through CBP One, a cellphone application program for migrants who have already left their home countries and are waiting in northern Mexico. Through the app, they can apply for an appointment to be considered for asylum, though they do not necessarily qualify.",
      "Two officials said targeting migrants who have applied to enter the country through these programs will be easier than finding others living in the U.S. because they had to provide addresses where they planned to live and other information to apply.",
      "Who will be targeted for deportation?",
      "Chinese nationals deemed of military age and considered to be illegally living in the U.S.\u00a0will be among those\u00a0targeted first because they may pose a national security risk, sources close to the Trump campaign said.",
      "In recent years, the number of Chinese nationals crossing into the U.S. has soared.\u00a0Prior to 2021, the number of Chinese nationals crossing illegally averaged less than 1,000 per year.",
      "The\u00a0number of undocumented Chinese nationals crossing both northern and southern borders into the U.S. nearly tripled from just over 27,000 in fiscal year 2022 to over 78,000 in fiscal year 2024.",
      "Of those who crossed in 2024, over 65,000 were single adults, per Customs and Border Protection data. It is not clear how many of them were male.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement has had a difficult time deporting migrants from China, as well as Nicaragua, Venezuela, Haiti and Cuba, because those countries often refuse to take back their nationals.",
      "Two sources familiar with the incoming administration\u2019s plans said the Trump administration may consider sending migrants to third countries if their home country refuses to accept them. Trump used a similar policy at the end of his first term when the U.S. deported migrants from third countries to Guatemala."

      "A person familiar with the thinking on Smith\u2019s team \u2014 who spoke on condition of anonymity to recount sensitive conversations \u2014 said they are confident their work can withstand legal scrutiny but are anxious about the expense and stress that often comes with being the target of a\u00a0federal\u00a0investigation.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The judge overseeing Donald Trump's federal election interference case has granted a request from special counsel Jack Smith to hit pause on the process and give him a month to formally request how to move forward \u2014 likely the first step in ending the prosecution.",
      "In a filing on Friday, Smith said that \"as a result of the election\" the prosecution \"respectfully requests that the Court vacate the remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule to afford the Government time to assess this unprecedented circumstance.\"",
      "\"By December 2, 2024, the Government will file a status report or otherwise inform the Court of the result of its deliberations,\" the filing said, adding that Trump's attorneys do not object to the request.",
      "U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan granted the motion shortly after it appeared on the court docket. \"All remaining deadlines in the pretrial schedule are VACATED. By December 2, 2024, the Government shall file a status report indicating its proposed course for this case going forward,\" the judge wrote.",
      "The Justice Department has a longstanding policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. The DOJ had begun assessing how to end the cases against Trump after he won the election, sources told NBC News this week.",
      "Trump was indicted in the case in August 2023, but significant delays have kept it from going to trial. Trump has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "Trump was charged in connection with the effort to overturn his 2020 election defeat and accused of fraud and trying to disenfranchise American voters. Separately, he was charged with mishandling classified documents in a Florida case that was ultimately dismissed over objections to Smith's status as a special prosecutor.",
      "Smith's office had been appealing that dismissal but that appeal is now expected to be dropped as DOJ officials see no room to pursue either criminal case and no point in continuing to litigate\u00a0them\u00a0in the remaining weeks before he takes office, sources told NBC News Wednesday.",
      "The department\u2019s position stems from a 2000\u00a0memo\u00a0by its own Office of Legal Counsel, which affirmed a\u00a0Watergate-era conclusion that a prosecution of a sitting president would \u201cunduly interfere in a direct or formal sense with the conduct of the presidency.\u201d",
      "Trump also faced state criminal charges in New York and Georgia. He's tentatively scheduled to be sentenced in the New York case on Nov. 26 after he was convicted earlier this year on 34 counts of falsifying business records, a low-level felony.",
      "The judge in the case, Juan Merchan, must first decide on Trump's request to have the charges thrown out in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision earlier this year expanding presidential immunity protections. Merchan is expected to rule on the issue next week.",
      "The Georgia election interference case has been on hold as Trump and some of his co-defendants are asking an appeals court to remove the prosecutor in the case because of conflict of interest allegations. Trump has denied any wrongdoing in the Georgia case as well.",
      "No trial date has been set in that case and legal experts have said constitutional issues will likely require any Georgia trial or New York retrial to be put on hold until Trump is done with his term in 2029.",
      "His return to office likely won't prevent the massive penalties stemming from civil cases against him, including one from New York Attorney General Letitia James and two from writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump also denied any wrongdoing in the civil cases.",

      "Welcome to the online version of\u00a0From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, chief political analyst Chuck Todd explains why the results of the 2022 midterm elections were a mirage for the Democrats . Plus, \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker has more from her interview with Donald Trump. And politics reporter Adam Edelman looks at how Democratic governors in blue states are already starting to push back against the coming GOP administration.",

      "Democrats\u2019 midterm mirage",
      "The biggest difference between the successes of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who both got re-elected, and the failure of the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris team to win four more years was their midterm experiences.",
      "Both Clinton and Obama got clobbered, forcing them to rethink some of their policies and how to sell them.",
      "Biden and the party as a whole took the Democrats\u2019 \u201cbetter than expected\u201d performance in the 2022 midterms, when they still lost the House but gained a Senate seat, as a sign that they were on to something and that they didn\u2019t need to course-correct as much as polling was actually telling them to.",
      "Democrats did well in the 2022 midterms despite Biden, not because of him or his pro-democracy messaging.",
      "The reality is that Democrats did better than expected in the 2022 midterms for two reasons: backlash to the Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision and the GOP\u2019s disastrous collection of candidates in swing states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan and Wisconsin.",
      "Toss in that more Democrats are now regular voters while more Republicans are irregular voters, thanks to the realignment of the two parties over education and class, and it was a recipe for overperformance by Democrats.",
      "When Republicans were more the party of the suburban upper middle class, they had the midterm turnout advantage almost automatically. Not anymore \u2014 it\u2019s why Democrats usually overperform in special elections, with more devoted \u201cevery election\u201d voters right now. Presidential elections are equalizers on those midterm turnout advantages.",
      "Had either Dobbs not happened or the GOP nominated more electable candidates, Republicans most likely would have won both House and Senate control in 2022, simply because of backlash to post-Covid inflation and a belief that Biden\u2019s policies extended the issue, as well as a negative feeling about the overall job Biden was doing.",
      "And a shellacking in 2022 for Biden and the Democrats that was more in line with 2010 (Obama\u2019s first midterm) or 1994 (Clinton\u2019s first midterm) would most likely have either forced a reckoning about whether Biden should run again (perhaps even inviting primary challengers) or forced Biden to course-correct more, and more forcefully, on economic and border security sooner.",
      "But that isn\u2019t what happened. In fact, the resurrection of Trump as the GOP front-runner for 2024 \u2014 which began in earnest in late 2022 \u2014 only hardened this (mis)belief among Democrats that anti-Trumpism, coupled with Dobbs backlash, would linger and become the easiest and safest path to re-election.",
      "Obviously, hindsight indicates this was a giant miscalculation.",
      "Read more from Chuck \u2192",
      "Here\u2019s what else Trump told me during our interview",
      "The headlines from my 15-minute phone interview Thursday with President-elect Donald Trump included his statements that there\u2019s \u201cno price tag\u201d for his mass deportation plan, and that the mandate from his victory is to \u201cbring common sense back.\u201d",
      "But there\u2019s plenty else he told me.",
      "Trump boasted about the size of his victory and his performance with key demographic groups: \u201cIt was such an honor to have received the kind of vote we have received, with Black Americans, with Asian Americans, the Hispanic, Hispanic population has been so incredible. Women. You know, I heard so much \u2014 women, ultimately, they wanted safety. They wanted security.\u201d",
      "National exit polls showed that Trump made gains among Latino voters, young voters, women and Asian American voters from 2020, while his support among Black voters remained about the same.",
      "He discussed his coattails, which helped some (but not all) downballot Republicans: \u201cI\u2019m honored that I helped all of these senators get in. \u2026 I worked very hard on the Senate. And I know certain House seats that we won that we weren\u2019t expected to win. But what it really tells me is that it\u2019s a mandate for the whole country, because women, men, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American. I mean, it did so well with Hispanic Americans \u2014 such an honor. It\u2019s really an honor.\u201d",
      "Trump endorsed many of the GOP\u2019s candidates in critical Senate and House races. Republicans regained control of the Senate, so far flipping three Democratic-held seats in West Virginia, Montana and Ohio. But Democrats managed to hold onto Senate seats in two states Trump carried, Michigan and Wisconsin. NBC News has yet to project winners in the Arizona, Pennsylvania and Nevada Senate races.",
      "In the House, Republicans had a 212-201 lead, with 22 races yet to be called as of Friday afternoon.",
      "Trump distinguished between cracking down on \u201cmurderers\u201d and \u201cdrug lords\u201d and legal immigration: \u201cWe obviously have to make the border strong and powerful and, and we have to \u2014 at the same time, we want people to come into our country. ... I\u2019m not somebody that says, \u2018No, you can\u2019t come in.\u2019 We want people to come in. We\u2019re gonna have a lot of businesses coming into our country. ... But we want people that aren\u2019t necessarily sitting in a jail because they murdered seven people. And I think you know, part of it, somebody said it very well: It was determined that when they got into the booth that they agreed with Trump, they didn\u2019t want murderers, they didn\u2019t want drug lords, they didn\u2019t want gang members.\u201d",
      "And he talked about the concession phone calls he received from Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden: \u201cVery nice calls, very respectful both ways. I got a call from the vice president and she talked about transition. She\u2019d like to see it be smooth as can be. And I agree with that, of course, 100%. It was a very, very friendly call. And likewise, with the president. He and I have agreed to have lunch very shortly, either before or after his trip [to South America].\u201d",

      "Healey, who as the state\u2019s attorney general during Trump\u2019s first term challenged his administration several times on immigration policies, said she\u2019d exercise her executive and regulatory authority, and make use of legislation in the state to fight various Trump policies.",
      "Specifically asked about Trump\u2019s plan to implement mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, Healey said she would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d allow state police to assist in such an effort.",
      "Asked about Democratic governors' response to Trump's return to the White House, Trump spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in a statement: \u201cThe American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another possible 2028 contender, referred to a statement he released Thursday in response to Trump\u2019s victory that focused heavily on unity when asked whether similar efforts were underway in the state.",
      "\u201cNow that this election is over, it is time to govern \u2014 to work together, to compromise, and to get stuff done,\u201d Shapiro said in that statement. \u201cI believe there\u2019s more that unites us than divides us \u2014 and we must work together to continue to get stuff done for Pennsylvania.",
      "Unlike in the deep-blue states of California, New York and Massachusetts, where Democrats enjoy a trifecta of power across state government, the Legislature in battleground Pennsylvania is split, which would make plans to counter Trump more difficult. Plus, Trump just carried the state at the presidential level.",
      "\u201cLet me also make clear: I will never back down from standing up for the freedoms I was elected to protect. I will continue to defend our democracy, defend our fundamental rights, and ensure we continue the legacy of William Penn by building a Commonwealth that is warm and welcoming for all,\u201d Shapiro added.",
      "In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy pledged to both push back against Trump when necessary, while also seeking out areas for compromise.",
      "\u201cIf it\u2019s contrary to our values,\u00a0we will fight to the death,\u201d Murphy said at a Wednesday press conference, mentioning issues such as immigration and reproductive rights.",
      "\u201cIf there\u2019s an opportunity for common ground, we will seize that as fast as anybody,\u201d he added."

      "Desperate for answers on what went wrong on Election Day, finger-pointing among Democrats and media pundits has been swift. Many \u2014 in private \u2014 are holding President Joe Biden responsible. Others are blaming the operatives who have run the party\u2019s last several campaigns. But some are pointing to an issue with far less power in American politics: transgender rights.",
      "\u201cThe Democrats have to stop pandering to the far left,\u201d Rep. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., told The New York Times on Wednesday. \u201cI don\u2019t want to discriminate against anybody, but I don\u2019t think biological boys should be playing in girls\u2019 sports.\u201d",
      "Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., shared a similar view, telling the Times on Thursday: \u201cDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face. I have two little girls. I don\u2019t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I\u2019m supposed to be afraid to say that.\u201d",
      "Representatives for Suozzi and Moulton did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "In Texas, where the battle over transgender rights has become particularly fierce in recent years, then-Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa told a local radio station that \u201cyou can support transgender rights up and down all the categories where the issue comes up, or you can understand that there\u2019s certain things that we just go too far on, that a big bulk of our population does not support.\u201d",
      "Hinojosa issued an apology on X on Wednesday, saying that he \u201cfailed to communicate my thoughts with care and clarity\u201d before resigning over Democratic losses on Friday.",
      "Brad Pritchett, the interim chief executive of LGBTQ advocacy group Equality Texas, condemned Hinojosa\u2019s comments and the wider argument by some Democrats that trans people contributed to Democratic losses.",
      "\u201cThis is something that Democrats need to stop and remember what their values are,\u201d Pritchett said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cWe live and run campaigns by the values we hold dear.\u201d",
      "He also said Democrats should not be \u201calienating\u201d some of their most loyal supporters. Eighty-six percent of LGBTQ voters said they supported Vice President Kamala Harris compared with 12% who said they supported Donald Trump, according to NBC News exit polling of 10 key states.",
      "Between the 2020 and 2024 elections, transgender rights have become a political flashpoint in the nation\u2019s culture wars.",
      "Thousands of anti-LGBTQ bills were filed in state legislatures across the country, with many of them targeting transgender Americans specifically, according to tallies by the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Corporate America was also pulled into the fray, with American brands like Bud Light facing immense backlash for partnering with trans influencers. And perhaps nothing stoked more conversation than the issue of transgender girls and women competing in girls and women\u2019s sports.",
      "In 2022, a streak of wins by transgender athlete Lia Thomas as a member of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s women\u2019s swim team sparked global headlines and conservative outrage. Thomas\u2019 win in the NCAA swimming championships provoked particular ire. This past summer, conspiracy theories that Olympic boxer Imane Khelif of Algeria was not born female exploded online, drawing atypical attention to the women\u2019s sport at the Paris Games.",
      "Throughout the campaign, Republicans spent more than $200 million on network television advertisements centered on transgender issues this year, according to data shared with NBC News by AdImpact, an analytics firm that tracks political ad spending.",
      "Ads that mentioned Harris\u2019 past support for taxpayer-funded gender-affirming care treatments were repeatedly aired during NFL and college football games last month. The ads ended with the tagline: \u201cKamala is for they/them; President Trump is for you.\u201d",
      "Harris largely avoided the issue on the trail and in interviews and it was notably absent from this year\u2019s Democratic National Convention.",
      "Asked if she believed that transgender Americans should have access to gender-affirming care in this country, Harris told NBC News\u2019 Hallie Jackson, \u201cThat is a decision that doctors will make in terms of what is medically necessary.\u201d Pressed further, she said, \u201cI believe that all people should be treated with dignity and respect, period, and should not be vilified for who they are, and should not be bullied for who they are.\u201d",
      "The Harris campaign\u2019s LGBTQ engagement director, Sam Alleman, urged voters not to blame trans people for Harris\u2019 loss.",
      "\u201cPlease do not blame trans issues or trans people for why we lost,\u201d he wrote on X on Thursday. \u201cNo exit polling or data is showing this as a significant decision point for voters.\u201d",
      "The issue voters most often cited as their No. 1 concern was \u201cthe state of democracy,\u201d followed closely by the economy, according to the NBC News exit polls.",
      "Brianna Wu, a prominent transgender Democratic activist, told NBC News in an interview that the debate over trans rights has \u201cradically shifted\u201d in recent years.",
      "Wu ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in 2018 and 2020 and now hosts a podcast on trans perspectives called \u201cDollcast.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt has moved from a message that\u2019s saying, \u2018This is my body, this is how I feel most comfortable. Please, let me do this and move on with my life,\u2019 to being able to self-ID into women\u2019s locker rooms and women need to deal with seeing penises that are fully intact in front of them,\u201d Wu said.",
      "Wu thinks trans people need to make compromises on what the broader public is willing to accept regarding trans issues.",
      "\u201cPlenty of gay men put on khakis and went on daytime TV to make the argument that love is love,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yeah, it\u2019s a little embarrassing, but you do what you have to do to talk to normal people.\u201d"

      "The total bill for ad spending in the 2024 election hit almost $11 billion, a new record and a substantial increase from the $9 billion spent in 2020.",
      "That's according to AdImpact, a firm that tracks political ad spending. The total is in line with the firm's 2023 projection that 2024 would see more ad spending than ever before.",
      "The largest share of the spending, unsurprisingly, came from the presidential race, where Democrats outspent Republicans despite losing the campaign.",
      "Vice President Kamala Harris' political operation spent more than $880 million since the start of 2023 (including spending when President Joe Biden was at the top of the ticket, as well as joint fundraising committees aligned with the campaign and the Democratic National Committee). President-elect Donald Trump's political operation, including his campaign, the national party and affiliated joint fundraising committees, spent about $425 million on ads.",
      "Overall, the Democratic campaign and pro-Democratic outside groups spent almost $1.8 billion, while the Trump campaign and pro-Republican outside groups spent $1.4 billion.",
      "The campaign for the Senate, which will be controlled by Republicans at the start of next year, drew about $2.6 billion in spending \u2014 $1.4 billion from Democratic candidates and outside groups and $1.2 billion from Republican candidates and pro-Republican groups. Ohio's Senate race, won by Republican Bernie Moreno, was the most expensive race as far as ad spending goes, with more than $538 million spent between the campaigns and outside groups.",
      "House races drew $1.7 billion in ad spending \u2014 $940 million from Democrats and $760 million from Republicans, with New York's 19th District (where NBC News' Decision Desk projects Democrat Josh Riley will defeat Republican Rep. Marc Molinaro) leading the pack with almost $40 million in ad spending.",
      "A relatively short list of competitive gubernatorial races this election cycle drew almost $530 million, including races held in 2023. North Carolina's gubernatorial race, where Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein is projected to defeat Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson after allegations that Robinson made inflammatory comments on a pornography site, led the way with almost $120 million in ad spending.",
      "All of the other downballot races, including ballot questions and constitutional amendments, state legislative races and more, drew $2.9 billion in spending. Florida's ballot amendment on legalizing marijuana (which appears to have failed) featured more than $122 million in ad spending, more than any other downballot race."

      "Bomb threats sent to polling places and ballot-counting locations in at least five battleground states across the U.S. Tuesday targeted mostly Democratic counties, an NBC News analysis has found.",
      "The full extent of who received the bomb threats is not clear. None are believed to have been deemed credible. NBC News compiled a list of 67 locations in 19 counties, based on local news reports and state and local election officials\u2019 statements, all of which appear to have received similar threats. Of the 67 locations, 56 were in 11 counties that voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 election, including the eight most populated. Those high-population Democratic counties include voting locations for Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Detroit, Michigan; Phoenix, Arizona; Atlanta, Georgia; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.",
      "Maricopa County, Arizona, which Biden won by a slim margin, has consistently been the subject of election denialism conspiracy theories. The other five \u2014 Michigan\u2019s Wayne County, Pennsylvania\u2019s Philadelphia County and Georgia\u2019s DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties \u2014 were some of the largest Democratic strongholds in their respective states.",
      "Much is still unknown about the threats, including the identity of who sent them. They do appear to have been designed to influence either the perception of the election outcome or the outcome itself, as all the threats known to NBC News were sent to the handful of battleground states widely believed by both parties to be crucial for winning the election. It\u2019s also unclear if the threats tended to focus on urban counties because they are better known or contain more people, or because they tend to be Democratic strongholds.",
      "\u201cThis is an extraordinary and very disturbing development,\u201d said Larry Norden, the vice president of the elections and government program at NYU\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cWhether it\u2019s a foreign or domestic actor that was involved, there needs to be repercussions for it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn some sense, we were lucky that there was a lot of preparation for this scenario going into 2024. I don\u2019t know that anybody expected the coordinated campaign that seems like that we had, but there were a lot of meetings of law enforcement and election officials, tabletop exercises and trainings to be prepared for this, and as a result, I think the disruption was mostly minimized,\u201d Norden said.",
      "Some locations that temporarily shut down on Tuesday, like DeKalb and Philadelphia County, extended their voting hours that evening. None of the threats resulted in a voting location closing for the day and there is no indication that the evacuations had a meaningful impact on voter turnout.",
      "Some of the threats also included counties that voted heavily for Donald Trump in 2020, including the comparatively smaller Blair and Clearfield Counties in Pennsylvania.",
      "The FBI said in an emailed statement Tuesday that \u201cmany\u201d of the threats \u201cappear to originate from Russian email domains.\u201d Some additional threats appeared to have been sent from a French service, a U.S. official briefed on the matter told NBC News. Anyone with unrestricted internet access can sign up for email services in other countries, making it difficult to deduce who actually sent the threats.",
      "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has openly blamed Russia for the threats since late Tuesday morning, though it\u2019s not clear if he\u2019s referencing the ones coming through a Russian email service or has access to additional intelligence. The FBI declined to provide further comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which in the lead-up to the election made formal attributions of online propaganda campaigns to countries like Iran and Russia, declined to comment.",
      "A spokesperson for Russia\u2019s embassy in Washington, D.C., denied the country was responsible.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the allegations by US officials you refer to, but no proof of Russian involvement was presented either to the public, or to the Embassy,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThe US Authorities didn\u2019t even bother to contact us on this matter.\u201d"

      "While Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the battleground state by more than 3 percentage points, Democrats won nearly every other statewide race that was on the ballot Tuesday.",
      "Those results largely comport with decades of political trends in North Carolina. But Democrats and Republicans alike also attributed them to Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson\u2019s disastrous campaign for governor, which was constantly plagued by his long history of incendiary remarks.",
      "\u201cWe squarely blame Mark Robinson for losses in races that Republicans would and should have otherwise won,\u201d said a North Carolina GOP operative, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.",
      "As was expected, Democrat Josh Stein overwhelmingly defeated Robinson in the race for governor, winning by nearly 15 percentage points.",
      "Democrats also eked out narrow wins in the races for lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and superintendent of public instruction.",
      "In the contest to replace Robinson as lieutenant governor, Democrat Rachel Hunt defeated Republican Hal Weatherman by 1.6 percentage points. In the contest to replace Stein as attorney general, Democrat Jeff Jackson beat Republican Dan Bishop by 2.6 points.",
      "In the secretary of state\u2019s race, incumbent Democrat Elaine Marshall defeated Republican Chad Brown by 1.9 points to win her eighth term. And in the state superintendent\u2019s race, Democrat Maurice Green defeated Republican Michele Morrow by 2.1 points to replace Republican Catherine Truitt, whom Morrow defeated in the primary this year.",
      "Democrats also seemed poised Friday to flip a seat in the Legislature that would break up Republicans\u2019 supermajority \u2014 and the power to override vetoes that comes with it. That race remains too close to call, according to The Associated Press, but the Democrat led the Republican on Thursday evening.",
      "Meanwhile, in a state Supreme Court race, Republican Jefferson Griffin led Democratic Justice Allison Riggs by two-tenths of a percentage point (about 10,000 votes) with 96% of the vote counted. NBC News hasn\u2019t yet called the race.",
      "For decades, voters in North Carolina have shown a propensity to elect Republicans for federal office while supporting Democrats in downballot statewide races.",

      "While Newton also credited Stein's campaign and vision, he said the results showed that \u201cDemocrats, Republicans and independents\u201d were \u201cdisgusted with Mark Robinson\u2019s extremism.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is something that clearly benefited Democrats up and down the ballot,\u201d he said.",
      "A Democratic operative in North Carolina, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly, said: \u201cIf you look at the people who were running in those races, they were kind of similar \u2014 prototypes, kind of \u2014\u00a0to Robinson.\u201d The operative mentioned specific speeches by Weatherman, as well as specific social media posts by Morrow.",
      "\u201cThere were a lot of attempts to tie the downballot candidates to Robinson, and I think it was successful for the candidates that were most similar to him,\u201d the operative said.",
      "A Robinson campaign spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to questions.",
      "Democrats in the state and nationally aggressively tied Republicans up and down the ballot in North Carolina to Robinson amid a constant unearthing of controversial remarks he had made. Those efforts were further ramped up after CNN reported that Robinson made inflammatory comments on the message board of a pornography website, which he denied.",
      "National Democrats also tried to extend that strategy to the presidential race, with the Democratic National Committee launching a cascade of ads linking Robinson to Trump immediately after the CNN report. But Trump\u2019s victory suggested that approach didn\u2019t bear fruit at the presidential level.",
      "The varying results, however, largely fit with long-standing political trends in the Southern battleground, particularly the tendency of its voters to simultaneously support Republican presidential candidates and Democratic candidates for governor.",
      "North Carolina, which holds its races for governor in presidential election years, has voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election but one since 1980. Over the same stretch, all but two of the governors elected have been Democrats.",
      "Meanwhile, North Carolina has elected only one Republican attorney general since 1901 and only one secretary of state who wasn\u2019t a Democrat since 1877. The political party of the state\u2019s elected lieutenant governors has been more mixed in recent decades.",
      "\u201cWelcome to the political legacy and history and trajectory of North Carolina politics. It\u2019s just who and what the state is,\u201d said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College near Charlotte. \u201cIt\u2019s baked into our political DNA.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "While supporters and relatives of Erik and Lyle Menendez have advocated for their resentencing and possible release from prison, current and former prosecutors who tried the brothers in the 1990s told NBC News that they believe the men are cold-blooded killers and should remain where they are \u2014\u00a0behind bars.",
      "In an exclusive interview, one of the prosecutors cast doubt on a new piece of potential evidence the brothers have presented in court to challenge their convictions.",
      "\u201cThey killed their parents. They slaughtered their mother,\u201d former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Pamela Bozanich, who prosecuted the brothers in their first trial, told \u201cDateline.\u201d \u201cWhy should they live among us?\u201d",
      "The brothers were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in the 1989 shotgun killings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, and have spent more than three decades in prison. But last month, Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gasc\u00f3n \u2014 who this week was voted out of office \u2014 told a judge that he supported resentencing the men to 50 years to life, which could make them eligible for parole immediately.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez no longer pose a public safety risk and have paid their debt to society, Gasc\u00f3n told reporters.",
      "The announcement was applauded by those who pointed to the horrific abuse the siblings said they endured for years at the hands of their father, a wealthy entertainment company executive. Their supporters said it was time for the men to be free.",
      "For Bozanich and another prosecutor who was involved in their second trial, it\u2019s not that simple. Bozanich, who did not believe that Jos\u00e9 Menendez abused the brothers, said that even if their account is accepted as true, they were still convicted of gunning down their parents in cold blood.",
      "Lyle, she said, shot their mom in the face at point-blank range after reloading his gun.",
      "Juan Mejia, now a head deputy for the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office, raised another concern. He has doubts about a new piece of possible evidence in the case \u2014 a letter Erik said he wrote to his cousin about the alleged abuse decades ago \u2014 that one of their lawyers has described as the \u201clinchpin\u201d in a recent effort to challenge their convictions.",
      "Mejia, who has not previously spoken out about the matter, said that his views are his own and do not represent the district attorney\u2019s office.",
      "Mejia was a young deputy district attorney during the brothers\u2019 second murder trial and later ran the division that reviewed the potential evidence \u2014 including the letter to the cousin \u2014 after it was filed in May 2023. He said the brothers have a history of fabrication, including Lyle\u2019s alleged efforts to have people lie for the defense at trial, and he feared the brothers hadn\u2019t changed in the manner described by Gasc\u00f3n.",
      "\u201cAre they trying to pull another fast one on the court?\u201d Mejia said.",
      "A lawyer for the brothers declined an interview request and did not respond to emailed requests for comment.",
      "Prosecutors are expected to weigh in on the petition with a filing later this month.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n told \u201cDateline\u201d that he knew there was dissent in his office over the decision to support resentencing and said he will allow other prosecutors to argue their position for continued incarceration in court. He wrestled with the decision himself, he said, because there was no question the murders were brutal and premeditated.",
      "But Gasc\u00f3n said he believed the brothers\u2019 account of abuse. And in the roughly 35 years they\u2019ve been behind bars, he said, they\u2019ve been \u201cexceptional prisoners all the way around.\u201d",
      "A hearing for the brothers\u2019 resentencing is scheduled for Dec. 11, a week after the county\u2019s new top prosecutor is sworn in. A judge will determine if Gasc\u00f3n\u2019s recommendation is appropriate.",
      "Incoming Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said he plans on reviewing the facts, evidence and law before making a decision on the case.\u00a0Multiple sources close to Hochman said Friday \u201cthere is a good chance\u201d he will seek a delay in the resentencing hearing as he seeks to review facts and evidence in the case.",
      "Lavish spending, pointing fingers",
      "On the night of Aug. 20, 1989, Lyle, then 21, dialed 911 and \u2014 in a frantic-sounding call \u2014 reported that someone had killed his parents. The couple had been gunned down in the den of their Beverly Hills home.",
      "The brothers initially told authorities that the killings may have been linked to their father\u2019s \u201cshady\u201d business contacts, according to Les Zoeller, a former Beverly Hills detective who investigated the case. They named one of the founders of their father\u2019s company who\u2019d once been a pornography distributor, Zoeller told \u201cDateline.\u201d But authorities investigated the tip and found nothing.",
      "Zoeller became increasingly suspicious of the brothers\u2019 extravagant spending after their parents\u2019 deaths. They bought Rolex watches, houses, a Jeep and a Porsche, an appeals decision in the case shows. The detective also learned that one day after their parents\u2019 deaths, the brothers had looked for their father\u2019s will after he threatened to disinherit them, the detective said.",
      "Eventually, investigators learned that Erik told a therapist that he and his brother killed their parents, Zoeller said. The brothers were arrested the following March and charged with first-degree murder.",
      "Abuse allegations",
      "When their televised trial began in 1993, the brothers testified and acknowledged killing their parents \u2014 but they said they\u2019d done it after Lyle confronted his father about the alleged sexual abuse and threatened to expose him.",
      "Lyle testified that he was molested until he was 8, while Erik said that the abuse was ongoing at the time of the killings.",
      "After a confrontation, Lyle testified, their father appeared to threaten them. Days later, the brothers \u2014 believing they were in imminent danger \u2014 burst through the door with shotguns they\u2019d bought in San Diego and opened fire, Lyle testified.",
      "Bozanich believed the claims of abuse were false. In the therapy sessions where the brothers revealed that they killed their parents, they never mentioned that it was because they\u2019d been abused, Zoeller said. And although some of the brothers\u2019 relatives testified that years before Erik and Lyle had indicated that their father was abusive, Bozanich said another relative told the prosecutor that she believed the brothers\u2019 claims were fabricated.",
      "\u201cShe confronted Lyle about it,\u201d Bozanich said of the relative. \u201cHe said to her, \u2018That\u2019s the way it\u2019s gonna be.\u2019\u201d",
      "Bozanich alleged that the killings were motivated by money \u2014 and the possibility that the brothers could have been disinherited from the family\u2019s multimillion dollar estate. While cross-examining Lyle, she also pointed to the cold-blooded nature of Kitty\u2019s killing.",
      "After the brothers opened fire, Lyle testified, he ran out of ammunition. So he went to the car, reloaded and \u2014 upon returning to the den \u2014 saw his mother moving toward his brother, he said. Lyle put the shotgun to her cheek and pulled the trigger, Bozanich said.",
      "A mistrial and then a conviction",
      "After a six-month trial, jurors were unable to come to a unanimous decision on whether the brothers had killed their parents in self-defense \u2014 and should be convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter \u2014 or if they were guilty of premeditated murder. A judge declared a mistrial.",
      "In 1995, the brothers were tried a second time. In the first trial they had said the killings were an act of \u201cimperfect self-defense,\u201d but because of a recent ruling from the state\u2019s high court, they were not allowed to claim\u00a0that legal doctrine, according to the appeals decision. And Lyle did not testify.",
      "That development came after authorities intercepted letters from Lyle that appeared to show him encouraging people to lie for the defense, Mejia said. In one instance, he asked a girlfriend to falsely claim she was sexually assaulted by Jose, while in another he asked a friend to claim he\u2019d provided the brothers with a gun for protection, according to the appeals decision.",
      "Erik and Lyle were convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.",
      "Their legal saga has drawn renewed public attention in recent months after the debut of a Netflix miniseries and documentary about their lives.",
      "Making a case for release",
      "In his interview with \u201cDateline,\u201d Gasc\u00f3n said that the brothers have been model prisoners who have helped inmates with severe disabilities and taken college courses. They\u2019ve established a green space \u201cbeautification\u201d project at the prison where they\u2019re incarcerated, he said, and there was no evidence they\u2019d been violent toward other inmates.",
      "When they committed their crimes, Gasc\u00f3n said, they were younger than 26. State and federal high court decisions have found that the part of the brain responsible for behavior control is not fully mature until a person\u2019s mid- to late-20s, and California law states that with few exceptions, people who committed crimes under the age of 26 \u201care required to have a meaningful opportunity for parole during their natural life.\u201d",
      "Now, Gasc\u00f3n said, the men are over 50 and married, meaning they\u2019re less likely to reoffend and more likely to reintegrate into society safely.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n acknowledged that the brothers\u2019 crimes were brutal and premeditated, but said they were \u201cposter cases\u201d for a resentencing unit his office established three years ago that seeks to determine if an inmate\u2019s prison term is no longer appropriate.",
      "Gasc\u00f3n said that under the program, more than 300 people have been resentenced with a recidivism rate that is less than 1%. The decision to recommend resentencing for the Menendez brothers was \u201cvery straightforward,\u201d he said.",
      "A letter surfaces",
      "Mejia agreed that the brothers likely meet the resentencing criteria. But he still opposes their release, he said.",
      "One issue, Mejia said, was the letter included in the petition challenging the brothers\u2019 convictions. The document is an undated photocopy of a handwritten letter that an attorney for the brothers, Mark Geragos, has said corroborates their father\u2019s alleged abuse.",
      "According to a declaration in the filing, Erik Menendez said he sent the letter to a cousin, Andy Cano, in December 1988, several months before the murders.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to avoid dad,\u201d the letter says. \u201cIt\u2019s still happening Andy but it\u2019s worse for me now.\u201d",
      "The document does not provide any details of the alleged abuse, but its author states that he is afraid of his father, who has warned him \u201ca hundred times about telling anyone.\u201d",
      "After the petition was filed, Mejia said, prosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office repeatedly requested the original letter from the brothers\u2019 attorneys. But the lawyers never produced one, and the cousin it was addressed to died in 2003, Mejia said. In his view, the document\u2019s reliability is in doubt.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t tell if it was written before the murders or after the conviction,\u201d Mejia said.",
      "Like Bozanich, Mejia said he remained troubled by the \u201cgruesomeness\u201d of the murders and how calculated they were. Maybe their mother knew about the alleged abuse and didn\u2019t do anything about it, he added, \u201cbut there\u2019s no justification for shooting your mom eight times with a shotgun and reloading.\u201d"

      "At the time of the fire, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to rebuild the iconic, 861-year-old structure within five years.",
      "\"Five years ago, a promise: to rebuild Notre-Dame Cathedral together,\" Macron said on X Friday. \"Today, its bells are finally ringing thanks to the extraordinary work of so many of you.\"",

      "Notre Dame will reopen its doors in one month, with ceremonies and celebrations planned to begin Dec. 7.",
      "The landmark also boasts three new bells, one of which rang at the Stade de France at the 2024 Paris Olympics and is inscribed with \"Paris 2024.\" The other two bells, Chiara and Carlos, are smaller, and were installed Thursday alongside the Olympic bell.",
      "In total, there are 21 bells at Notre Dame, each of which is named for an important figure in the church.",
      "Since the fire on April 15, 2019, during which flames engulfed the roof and the spire, Notre Dame's bells have been undergoing cleaning.",
      "Rebuilding Notre Dame required help from skilled craftsmen from around the globe and the use of tools \u2014 created on-site \u2014 that match those used by the original workers who built the cathedral centuries ago.",
      "It also required 2,000 Oak trees from forests across Europe that dried for 12 to 19 months before the wood was used in the rebuild.",
      "The ambitious project was estimated to cost $760 million. According to Rebuilding Notre Dame de Paris, the public body responsible for the conservation and restoration of the cathedral, 340,000 donors from more than 150 countries donated more than $900 million to the effort."

He noted good-naturedly that \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail!\u201d became a catchphrase that \u201cI have a certain amount of trouble trying to escape.\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 08 Nov 2024 17:42:19 GMT",
    "summary": "Gen. Kevin Schneider, a top US commander in the region, told NBC News that Chinese military flights have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president took office in May.",
    "story": [
      "The\u00a0Chinese military has\u00a0increased\u00a0its provocative flights around Taiwan by 300% over the last five months, according to the commander of the U.S. Air Forces in the Indo-Pacific Command.",
      "In an exclusive interview with NBC News, Gen. Kevin Schneider warned that People\u2019s Liberation Air Force activities have increased dramatically since Taiwan\u2019s new president was inaugurated in May.",
      "\u201cWhether it\u2019s coming into the air defense identification zone or crossing the center line within the Taiwan Strait, since the inauguration we have seen a 300% increase in those air activities,\u201d he said.",
      "From May 2023 until November 2023, China violated Taiwan\u2019s air defense identification zone 335 times, according to figures released by Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defense compiled by NBC News. During that same timeframe this year, China violated that same airspace at least 1,085 times, more than three times as many as the previous year.",
      "During some months, the difference was even more pronounced. In July 2023, for example, 50 Chinese aircraft violated Taiwan's air defense zone. In July 2024, 210 did, more than four times as many.",
      "Schneider noted that the Chinese Air Force has maintained the increased activity level since Lai Ching-te was sworn in\u00a0on May 20.\u00a0Beijing, which views Lai a \u201cseparatist\u201d and a \u201ctroublemaker,\u201d claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, a view Lai and his government reject.",
      "A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., defended the flights.",
      "\u201cThe PLA\u2019s relevant drills are a necessary and legitimate move to crack down on \u201cTaiwan independence\u201d separatist forces and their separatist activities and send a warning to external interference and provocations,\u201d said Liu Pengyu. It is fully consistent with international law and common practices.",
      "Schneider oversees more than 46,000 airmen in Japan, South Korea, Hawaii, Alaska and Guam. He said the biggest challenge he faces comes from Beijing, which is building a massive rocket force, an air force, a submarine force and a cyber force, and using these forces to intimidate other nations\u00a0in the region.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the behaviors that have gone along with that,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s the bullying, the aggressiveness.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy assessment is it\u2019s a pressurization campaign designed to win without fighting, and I think just to continue to impose costs, physical or otherwise, to present a fait accompli to the world,\u201d\u00a0he added.\u00a0\u201cNot just to Taiwan, but to the world that Beijing can accomplish their objectives, and they continue to ramp up their activities, military activities, in conjunction with diplomatic activities, informational activities, economic activities, to win without fighting.\u201d",
      "Will Trump defend Taiwan?",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping has said that he intends to unify Taiwan with mainland China and has steadily ramped up military pressure on democratically governed Taiwan. U.S. intelligence officials say Xi has directed his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.",
      "CIA Director William Burns has publicly said that does not mean Xi will invade in 2027, but \u201cit\u2019s a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and ambition.\u201d",
      "U.S. officials have pointed to 2027 as a possible inflection point for conflict between China and Taiwan, a year that now falls in President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s second term in office.",
      "Trump has not committed to defending Taiwan during a Chinese military invasion.",
      "\u201cTaiwan should pay us for defense,\u201d he told Bloomberg Businessweek in July. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re no different than an insurance company.\u201d",
      "While Trump has repeatedly characterized the relationship as transactional, some senior advisers in his first term were among the most strident supporters of Taiwan, revising the process for arms sales to Taiwan and increasing the sales during Trump\u2019s administration, which also sent high-level officials to Taiwan. Both actions increased tensions between Washington and Beijing under President Trump.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how President-elect Trump will work with President Xi over the next four years.\u00a0But the two have spoken since Trump won the 2024 election, according to the Chinese government, which quoted Xi as telling Trump that the two nations must find a way to get along.",
      "A current U.S. official said the relationship between the two nations during President Joe Biden\u2019s term in office was also marked by tensions but made progress in some areas in recent years.",
      "\u201cChina for sure thought they\u2019d be back into a much better relationship with the Biden administration, and have been sorely disappointed,\u201d said a senior U.S. official who tracks Chinese politics.",
      "Gen. Schneider said the timing for possible action in 2027 by China is still unclear, but he warned that their behavior has grown more aggressive and that China is operating farther and farther away from mainland China, both in the air and at sea.",
      "Their\u00a0goal is to push the U.S. out of the region while building their military capabilities, which Schneider said Beijing learned from the U.S. military\u2019s military operations in the Middle East.",
      "\u201cWe had the ability to take our time, to bring our forces into the theater, to build up large bases, to build up our capability, and then at the time of our choosing, when we had the advantages of mass in place, was to be able to determine when we would go to conduct our operations,\u201d\u00a0he said.\u00a0\u201cI assess that Beijing has recognized that, and now that they are building this capability to prevent us from ever being able to do that and replicating it.\u201d",
      "Gen. Schneider said adversaries in the region could try to test a new\u00a0Trump administration in its early days. \u201cRegardless of which party wins, this is where the opportunist part comes in, that actors in the region may seek to challenge a new administration.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that we on the military side are ready for, and we continue to provide options back to our national leadership,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cEither to prevent or to deal with someone that would provide a test for a new administration early in your career.\u201d",
      "Ultimately,\u00a0Schneider added, the U.S. is still focused on preventing conflict in the region.",
      "\u201cWe continue to deter effectively. And for over 80 years, the peace, the relative peace and stability of this region, has been unwritten by the presence of the United States military and that of our partners and allies, and we will continue to do that,\u201d\u00a0he said. \u201cAnd if that peace, stability and security is unilaterally upended by anyone in the region, then we will react, and we will react with a network of allies and partners that is incredibly capable.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",
      "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains in the doomed Roman town has revealed that some of the victims of Mount Vesuvius\u2019s eruption in A.D. 79 have been wrongly identified, highlighting how much modern day thinking has been projected onto the ancient world.",
      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",
      "Researchers from Italy's University of Florence and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in the German city of Leipzig also took part in the study, which examined 14 casts undergoing restoration in a bid determine the victims\u2019 sex, ancestry and genetic relationships using genetic material preserved for almost 2,000 years.",
      "Their findings also revealed that residents of the seaside resort favored by wealthy Romans had diverse backgrounds, primarily tracing their ancestry to eastern Mediterranean immigrants, highlighting the mobility of people and the multicultural nature of the Roman Empire.",
      "Before the eruption, which lasted for more than 24 hours and had the\u00a0power of thousands\u00a0of nuclear bombs, Mount Vesuvius\u00a0had been mostly dormant for centuries.",
      "An estimated 20,000 people lived in Pompeii at the time and many were consumed by a wave of ash, pumice and mud, freezing them in place beneath a fresh layer of volcanic sediment.",
      "Over the centuries, Pompeii and the dead were forgotten, remaining buried for almost two millennia until a farmer found part of the city beneath a vineyard in 1748.",
      "In the 19th century, archaeologists pioneered the technique of pouring plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating lifelike casts.",
      "Since then, more than 100 of these casts have been produced, capturing the victims' forms along with any surviving bones preserved through the centuries, according to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.",
      "Research at Pompeii continues to reveal new details about the ancient city and its people, with fresh discoveries made all the time.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers were awarded a $700,000 prize for employing artificial intelligence to decipher a 2,000-year-old scroll that had been charred in the eruption.",
      "And last year, excavations revealed people had died as a result of an earthquake as well as the eruption and an opulent house was unveiled two decades after restoration began."

      "She then pointed out that the sculptor even included the beauty mark on her chin.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to make an \u2018All I Want for Christmas\u2019 all year round experience. This dress is inspired by Marilyn Monroe,\u201d she explained in the video. She also revealed that the rubies the figure is wearing is her own jewelry.",

      "The fighting erupted after the match between the Israeli team and the Dutch club Ajax.

    "story": [
      "Arrests. Classified documents. And suspected leaks that may have harmed efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in order, critics say, to give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu public cover for failing to agree to a cease-fire deal. Netanyahu was engulfed in scandal Monday over a case involving one of his aides that has sent shock waves across the country.",
      "The firestorm \u2014 brought into public view when an Israeli court loosened a gag order Sunday night \u2014 has enraged Netanyahu's political opponents and hostages\u2019 families. Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and distanced himself from the case, but critics have alleged that he put hostages' lives and national security at risk to buttress his hard-line position in stalled cease-fire talks by leaking Gaza documents to friendly media outlets.",
      "In a ruling Sunday, the Rishon Le-Zion Magistrates\u2019 Court\u00a0said an investigation had been launched after suspicions arose within the Israel Defense Forces and the Israel Security Agency, or the Shin Bet, that \"classified and sensitive intelligence\" had been illegally taken from IDF systems.",
      "The action, the court said, may not only have caused \u201cserious harm to state security and the endangerment of intelligence sources,\" but it also could have harmed \"the goal of releasing the hostages\" who were taken captive during Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks.",
      "The court identified the central suspect in the case as Eliezer Feldstein, reported by Israeli media to have been one of Netanyahu\u2019s media advisers.",
      "In addition to Feldstein, three other people the court described as \"detainees involved in the activities\" were questioned. The court has yet to publicly identify them.",
      "Israeli media have reported that the information suspected of being leaked formed the basis of multiple articles on Hamas' approach to the hostage situation, including an article published by the London-based Jewish Chronicle that was later withdrawn after widespread criticism. NBC News was not immediately able to independently confirm that reporting.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle article had suggested that Hamas planned to move hostages out of Gaza through Egypt, while a separate article published by the German newspaper Bild reported that Hamas was drawing out negotiations for a cease-fire deal as a form of psychological warfare on Israel.",
      "Both articles drew skepticism from Israeli observers given their timing and the apparent cover they gave Netanyahu as he was accused of deliberately sabotaging cease-fire negotiations.",
      "\u201cThere was something very fishy about them. Also about the timing of everything,\u201d Mairav Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "The Jewish Chronicle and Bild did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The reports emerged as Netanyahu insisted on Israeli control over the Philadelphi Corridor along Gaza's border with Egypt, a demand that became a major sticking point in cease-fire talks. They also came as Netanyahu faced mounting outrage from hostages\u2019 families and much of the country's public over his failure to agree to a cease-fire deal after six hostages were killed in Hamas' captivity.",
      "While Israeli media had reported some details of the probe and the gag order had been partially lifted last week, it was not until Sunday that crucial and explosive allegations were revealed.",
      "In a statement before the ruling, Netanyahu's office said the materials suspected of being leaked had never reached the prime minister's office from the Military Intelligence Directorate and that Netanyahu had learned about the document in question from the media.",
      "It added that the aide implicated in the suspected leaks had \"never participated in security discussions, was not exposed or received classified information, and did not take part in secret visits.\"",
      "But political opponents, hostages\u2019 families and critics expressed outrage over the potential involvement of one of Netanyahu's aides.",
      "\"It\u2019s left me yet again disappointed but not surprised by this government,\" said Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose son Sagui was taken hostage by Hamas on Oct. 7.",
      "\"I feel utterly betrayed, not just as a hostage father but as an Israeli citizen,\" he said in a phone interview Monday.",
      "Dekel-Chen said that if the allegations raised in the investigation are true, it would be the latest in a \"long series\" of moments when Netanyahu's government has \"invented reasons to not move forward in the negotiation process.\"",
      "Gil Dickmann's cousin Carmel Gat was one of six hostages killed in Hamas captivity \u2014 an incident that sparked national outrage not long before the media reports were published.",
      "He noted the timing but said that if the intention was to sway public opinion, \"it didn't work,\" as he pointed to major demonstrations in the following days pressuring Netanyahu to secure a cease-fire.",
      "In a statement, the Hostage and Missing Families Forum, which represents the families of those still in Hamas captivity, expressed \u201coutrage and deep concern\u201d at the possibility that at least one Netanyahu aide may have \u201cworked to undermine public support\u201d for a deal.",
      "Benny Gantz, who resigned from Netanyahu's now-dissolved war Cabinet in June, said on X that \"if sensitive security information was stolen and used as a tool in a political survival campaign, it\u2019s not just a criminal offense; it\u2019s a national crime.\"",
      "Opposition leader Yair Lapid rejected claims from Netanyahu's office that Netanyahu had been previously unaware of the materials alleged to have been leaked.",
      "\"If Netanyahu didn\u2019t know that his close aides were stealing documents, planting spies within the IDF, forging documents, exposing intelligence sources, and passing classified documents to the foreign press to stop the hostage deal\u2014what *does* he know?\" Lapid said on X.",
      "Zonszein, Crisis Group\u2019s senior analyst on Israel, said that even if Netanyahu was not directly involved, the suspected leak would have emerged from a \u201cwell-oiled machine that is already accustomed to taking sensitive information and manipulating it for political purposes.\u201d",
      "But she said that would not \"come as a surprise at all.\"",
      "\"I think for the people who are already convinced that Netanyahu was playing with the public's consciousness and wasn't interested in a hostage deal, this is kind of just further proof,\" she said."

    "summary": "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains from Pompeii reveals that victims of Vesuvius\u2019s eruption have been wrongly identified.",
    "story": [
      "Centuries on and it turns out that long-held assumptions about some of the people of Pompeii should not have been set in stone.",
      "New DNA analysis of skeletal remains in the doomed Roman town has revealed that some of the victims of Mount Vesuvius\u2019s eruption in A.D. 79 have been wrongly identified, highlighting how much modern day thinking has been projected onto the ancient world.",
      "\u201cWe show that the individuals\u2019 sexes and family relationships do not match traditional interpretations,\u201d wrote the authors of the research published Thursday in the journal Current Biology. \u201cModern assumptions about gendered behaviors may not be reliable lenses through which to view data from the past,\u201d they added.",
      "Pompeii's victims were later immortalized by archaeologists who used plaster to fill the voids left by their bodies and observers have long created stories based on these casts, one of which was long assumed to be a mother holding a child and two women embracing as they died.",
      "But the DNA analysis has shown the person thought to be the mother was actually a man who was unrelated to the child, according to the new research.",
      "And at least one of the people locked in the embrace \u2014 long assumed to be sisters or a mother and daughter \u2014 was a man.",
      "\u201cThe genetic results encourage reflection on the dangers of making up stories about gender and family relationships in past societies based on present-day expectations,\u201d one of the study\u2019s authors, professor David Reich, said in interview Thursday with the Harvard Medical School, where he lectures.",
      "Researchers from Italy's University of Florence and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in the German city of Leipzig also took part in the study, which examined 14 casts undergoing restoration in a bid determine the victims\u2019 sex, ancestry and genetic relationships using genetic material preserved for almost 2,000 years.",
      "Their findings also revealed that residents of the seaside resort favored by wealthy Romans had diverse backgrounds, primarily tracing their ancestry to eastern Mediterranean immigrants, highlighting the mobility of people and the multicultural nature of the Roman Empire.",
      "Before the eruption, which lasted for more than 24 hours and had the\u00a0power of thousands\u00a0of nuclear bombs, Mount Vesuvius\u00a0had been mostly dormant for centuries.",
      "An estimated 20,000 people lived in Pompeii at the time and many were consumed by a wave of ash, pumice and mud, freezing them in place beneath a fresh layer of volcanic sediment.",
      "Over the centuries, Pompeii and the dead were forgotten, remaining buried for almost two millennia until a farmer found part of the city beneath a vineyard in 1748.",
      "In the 19th century, archaeologists pioneered the technique of pouring plaster into voids left by decomposed bodies, creating lifelike casts.",
      "Since then, more than 100 of these casts have been produced, capturing the victims' forms along with any surviving bones preserved through the centuries, according to the Archaeological Park of Pompeii.",
      "Research at Pompeii continues to reveal new details about the ancient city and its people, with fresh discoveries made all the time.",
      "Earlier this year, three researchers were awarded a $700,000 prize for employing artificial intelligence to decipher a 2,000-year-old scroll that had been charred in the eruption.",
      "And last year, excavations revealed people had died as a result of an earthquake as well as the eruption and an opulent house was unveiled two decades after restoration began."

      "China also seeks to reduce its reliance on foreign imports, a concern borne out after the election as the next U.S. president this week of Donald Trump, who has been vocal about increasing trade tariffs and decoupling supply chains from the world\u2019s second-largest economy.",
      "Alongside drones, weapons systems, aircraft and electronic warfare technologies, China\u2019s emerging role as a commercial airliner manufacturer through state-owned planemaker COMAC will be on display.",

      "Diplomats and security analysts have closely watched the evolution of J-35 variants given the importance of the plane to China\u2019s aircraft carrier program, which seeks to expand jets\u2019 range and payload to project power beyond China\u2019s home waters.",

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol denied wrongdoing on Thursday in a burgeoning influence-peddling scandal involving him and his wife that is severely hurting his approval ratings and providing political munition to his rivals.",
      "The political firestorm coincides with South Korea facing a slew of critical foreign policy issues, such as Donald Trump\u2019s election win to become the next president of the United States and North Korea\u2019s reported entry into the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "The scandal centers around allegations that Yoon and first lady Kim Keon Hee exerted inappropriate influence on the conservative governing People Power Party to pick a certain candidate to run for a parliamentary by-election in 2022 at the request of Myung Tae-kyun, an election broker and founder of a polling agency who conducted free opinion surveys for Yoon before he became president.",
      "For weeks, the scandal has been making headlines in South Korea as Myung\u2019s leaked phone conversations show he boasted of his influence over the presidential couple and other top governing party officials.",
      "Asked about his ties with Myung during a news conference Thursday, Yoon said, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything inappropriate and have nothing to hide regarding Myung Tae-kyun.\u201d",
      "Yoon said he has never meddled in any candidate nomination process at the PPP, and had never asked Myung to carry out surveys for him, though he acknowledged that Myung gave him some sort of help during his presidential primary campaign in 2021.",
      "The main liberal opposition Democratic Party said Yoon\u2019s response only showed his \u201carrogance\u201d and \u201cself-righteousness.\u201d The party earlier demanded that Yoon apologize, reshuffle top officials and accept an independent investigation into his wife.",
      "The Democratic Party recently shared what it said was an audio file of phone calls between Yoon and Myung on May 9, 2022 \u2014 a day before Yoon took office for a single five-year term. The opposition party alleges that the conversation proves Yoon provided Myung with political favors in return for free surveys.",
      "In the audio file, Yoon can be heard telling Myung that he asked a PPP committee to pick senior party member Kim Young-sun to run for one of the parliamentary by-elections the following month. Kim Young-sun eventually obtained the party\u2019s nomination and won the election.",
      "In the file, Myung is heard saying, \u201cI really won\u2019t forget this favor for my entire life. Thank you!\u201d",
      "South Korea\u2019s election law bars public servants, including the president, from interfering in elections, but applies no such restrictions to a president-elect, so it\u2019s unclear whether Yoon violated the law.",
      "Recent surveys showed Yoon\u2019s approval rating has fallen below 20% for the first time since his inauguration. Kim Keon Hee has been grappling with other scandals, such as spy camera footage purportedly showing her accepting a luxury bag as a gift from a pastor.",
      "Yoon apologized for causing public concerns about him and his wife, but stressed that many of the allegations raised were not consistent with the facts.",
      "Some governing party lawmakers have accused the Democratic Party of deliberately ramping up political attacks on Yoon and his wife in an effort to rescue its embattled leader, Lee Jae-myung, from legal troubles.",
      "Lee, a firebrand lawmaker who narrowly lost to Yoon in the 2022 presidential election, is undergoing four separate trials over corruption and various other allegations. The first two district court rulings on Lee over his election law violation and perjury charges are set for Nov. 15 and Nov. 25.",
      "Either a prison sentence or a fine of more than 1 million won ($750) in the election law case would unseat Lee as a lawmaker and disqualify him from running in elections for five years, although he is likely to appeal any guilty verdict.",
      "Surveys show Lee is the early favorite for the 2027 presidential race to succeed Yoon.",
      "On foreign policy, Yoon \u2014 who has worked closely with Washington and Tokyo to solidify security cooperation in the face of North Korean threats \u2014 expressed optimism that the three-way partnership will continue to expand under Trump\u2019s government. He said he wants to meet Trump and new Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba soon to coordinate policies.",
      "During his previous presidency, Trump engaged in highly orchestrated nuclear summits with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Yoon noted that North Korea\u2019s arsenal has significantly advanced since Trump\u2019s diplomacy with Kim collapsed in 2019.",
      "Yoon said Trump \u201cwill be receiving comprehensive reports very soon about how North Korea\u2019s nuclear technologies and capabilities have changed since then.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter he receives these reports, I think we can have more meaningful and in-depth discussions when we have the opportunity to meet,\u201d Yoon said.",
      "When asked about concerns that Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures, Yoon said Seoul was making \u201cmultifaceted efforts to minimize the losses to our people\u2019s economy.\u201d",
      "\u201cThings can\u2019t be exactly the same as they were during the Biden administration,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we have been preparing to hedge these risks for a long time.\u201d",
      "Earlier Thursday, Yoon had a telephone call with Trump, congratulating him on his election win and discussing strengthening bilateral cooperation. The two agreed to arrange an in-person meeting soon, according to Yoon\u2019s office."

      "Authorities here have ramped up stimulus announcements since late September, fueling a stock rally. President\u00a0Xi Jinping\u00a0led a meeting on Sept. 26 that called for\u00a0strengthening fiscal and monetary support, and stopping the real estate market slump.",
      "While the\u00a0People\u2019s Bank of China\u00a0has already cut several interest rates, major increases in government debt and spending require approval by the country\u2019s parliament, called the National People\u2019s Congress.",
      "That approval was expected to be granted at the weeklong meeting of the legislature\u2019s standing committee, which ended Friday. During a similar meeting in October of last year, authorities had approved a rare increase in China\u2019s deficit to 3.8%, from 3%, according to state media.",
      "Analysts expected\u00a0an increase in the scale\u00a0of fiscal support after Donald Trump \u2014 who has threatened harsh tariffs on Chinese goods \u2014 won the U.S. presidential election this week. But some remained cautious, warning that Beijing might remain conservative and not issue direct support to consumers.",
      "When discussing planned fiscal support at a news conference last month, Lan emphasized the need to\u00a0address local government debt problems.",
      "At the\u00a0parliamentary meeting, officials had reviewed a plan to increase the limit on how much debt local governments can issue, according to state media. The additional quota would go toward swapping out local governments\u2019 hidden debt.",
      "Nomura estimates that China has 50 trillion yuan to 60 trillion yuan ($7 trillion to $8.4 trillion) in such hidden debt, and said it expected that Beijing could allow local authorities to increase debt issuance by 10 trillion yuan over the next few years.",
      "That could save local governments 300 billion yuan in interest payments a year, Nomura said.",
      "In recent years, the country\u2019s real estate slump has drastically limited a significant source of local government revenues. Regional authorities also had to spend on Covid-19 controls during the pandemic.",
      "Even before then, local Chinese government debt had\u00a0grown to 22% of GDP by the end of 2019, far more than the growth in revenue available to pay that debt, according to an International Monetary Fund report."

      "Mubi\u00a0has scrapped an entire festival it had planned in Turkey after local authorities banned a screening of Luca Guadagnino\u2019s \u201cQueer.\u201d",
      "The arthouse distributor and streamer was due to hold the annual Mubi Fest Istanbul between Nov. 7-10 with \u201cQueer\u201d \u2014\u00a0based on the William S. Burroughs novel and starring Daniel Craig as a gay expat living in Mexico \u2014\u00a0set as the opener. But when it was told to pull the screening at the last minute by authorities who deemed it to contain \u201cprovocative content,\u201d the company opted to cancel the festival altogether, saying that the ban targeted the \u201cvery essence and purpose\u201d of the event.",
      "\u201cQueer\u201d \u2014\u00a0releasing in the U.S. with A24 \u2014\u00a0world premiered in Venice to positive reviews. After the festival, Mubi acquired the film for multiple territories, including the U.K., Ireland, Canada, Latin America, Germany, Austria, Benelux, Spain, Turkey and India and all rights excluding theatrical in Italy.",
      "See Mubi\u2019s statement below:",
      "\u201cHours before the opening of MUBI Fest Istanbul 2024, which we have been meticulously planning for months, and which was announced a few weeks ago and sold out days ago, we were informed that the screening of \u2018Queer\u2019 \u2014 the festival\u2019s opening film \u2014 has been banned by a decision of the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y District Governorate of Istanbul.",
      "The decision states that the film is prohibited on the grounds that it contains provocative content that could endanger public peace, with the ban being imposed for security reasons. We believe this ban is a direct restriction on art and freedom of expression. Festivals are spaces that celebrate art, cultural diversity, and community, bringing people together. This ban not only targets a single film but also undermines the very essence and purpose of the festival.",
      "For this reason, MUBI has decided to take the position that our audience expects from us. It is with deep regret that we inform you of our decision to cancel the entire MUBI Fest Istanbul. We would like to extend our heartfelt thanks to all the artists, audiences, and supporters who were eager to be part of the festival. We truly appreciate your understanding and solidarity. We know you are as saddened by this situation as we are.",
      "We will continue to advocate for the protection of freedom of expression and artistic integrity. Information regarding ticket refunds will be provided at a later date.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 A self-described Nazi became the first person in Australia to be sentenced to prison for performing an outlawed salute when he was ordered by a magistrate on Friday to spend one month behind bars.",
      "Jacob Hersant, 25, is also the first person in the state of Victoria to be convicted of performing the Nazi salute. The gesture has been outlawed nationwide since he committed the offense.",
      "He was convicted in the Melbourne Magistrates Court last month of performing the salute before news cameras outside the Victoria County Court on Oct. 27, 2023. Hersant had just avoided a prison sentence on a conviction for causing violent disorder. Performing a Nazi salute had been outlawed by the state parliament days earlier.",
      "Magistrate Brett Sonnet allowed Hersant to remain free on bail after he was convicted until Friday, when he was sentenced to one month in prison.",
      "He faced a potential maximum sentence of 12 months in prison plus a fine of 24,000 Australian dollars ($16,025).",
      "Hersant\u2019s lawyer, Tim Smartt, said the sentence would be appealed and that he would apply for bail in a higher court pending an appeal hearing.",
      "Smartt said Hersant should not be jailed for a nonviolent act.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not justified sending a 25-year-old to prison. That is wrong,\u201d Smartt told the magistrate.",
      "Sonnet said a prison sentence was appropriate.",
      "\u201cIf there was physical violence, then I would have imposed a sentence close to the maximum penalty,\u201d Sonnet said. \u201cThe accused sought to promote Nazi ideology in the public arena and the court is satisfied he took advantage of the media to disseminate extreme political views.\u201d",
      "Sonnet said Hersant was a member of the National Socialist Network, an organization that promotes white supremacy, deportation of immigrants and far-right actors.",
      "While performing the salute last year, he praised Nazi leader Adolf Hitler and said, \u201cAustralia for the white man.\u201d",
      "Sonnet said his words were \u201cclearly racist and seek to promote white supremacy in Australia.\u201d",
      "\u201cPut bluntly, the white man is not superior to any other race of people,\u201d Sonnet said.",
      "Hersant\u2019s lawyers had argued that his comments and salute were protected by an implied constitutional freedom of political communication.",
      "On his way into court on Friday, Hersant maintained that he had a right to express his political views.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to argue that the law is constitutionally invalid and it\u2019s emotional and it\u2019s anti-white,\u201d Hersant told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s my political view and I think it\u2019s a good fight for us to have an argument in court saying these laws are invalid.\u201d"
