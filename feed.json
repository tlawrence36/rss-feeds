      "The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster",
      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",
      "\u201cThis is an existential crisis for the BBC,\u201d said Julie Posetti, a journalism professor at City St. George\u2019s University of London. \u201cIn capitulating so quickly, it has sent a signal that it\u2019s relatively easy to cow the BBC.\u201d",
      "That is \u201cincredibly dangerous\u201d in an increasingly polarized environment \u201cwhere the information ecosystem is incredibly polluted,\u201d she warned.",
      "A look at the scandal, past criticism of the BBC and uncertainty about its future:",
      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",
      "The memo also criticized BBC coverage of transgender issues, alleging that the broadcaster\u2019s reporters promoted a pro-trans agenda, and warned about an anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service.",
      "Reacting to the resignations Sunday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted a screen grab of an article headlined \u201cTrump goes to war with \u2018fake news\u2019 BBC.\u201d Trump himself wrote on social media that BBC journalists were \u201ccorrupt\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d and \u201ctried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election.\u201d",
      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "La Fenice opera house in Venice faces a dispute over the appointment of Beatrice Venezi as musical director",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The storied Venetian opera house La Fenice is embroiled in a dispute with its orchestra and chorus over the appointment of a young and telegenic musical director with ties to Premier Giorgia Meloni but none with the musicians she has been hired to conduct.",
      "La Fenice\u2019s general manager, Nicola Colabianchi, who joined the theater in March, has defended his choice of 35-year-old Beatrice Venezi, saying her youthful energy will bring a new audience to the theater where Giuseppe Verdi premiered \u2018\u2019Rigoletto\u2019\u2019 and \u2018\u2019La Traviata\u2019\u2019 more than 170 years ago.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s young and dynamic, she\u2019s already written several books and she\u2019s conducted many orchestras. She\u2019s a person who attracts a great deal of media attention. So all of this will only bring attention to the theater and the theater\u2019s future,'' Colabianchi said in an interview. \u201dWe can\u2019t think the theater can survive with 80-year-old season ticket holders.\u2019\u2019",
      "In the six weeks since Venezi\u2019s appointment, effective next October, was announced by La Fenice on social media, striking workers forced the cancellation of an opera premiere and unions have called for Colabianchi\u2019s resignation.",
      "Another protest was planned for Monday, backed by other Italian opera houses in solidarity.",
      "Critics say Venezi doesn\u2019t have the requisite experience for a theater of La Fenice\u2019s profile, where famed conductors Arturo Toscanini, Claudio Abbado and Riccardo Muti have lifted their batons. They also suggest the choice was influenced by Venezi\u2019s ties to Meloni and her far-right Brothers of Italy.",
      "Venezi has not publicly commented on the La Fenice dispute, and canceled a public appearance to avoid polemics.",
      "She is the daughter of a prominent member of Forza Nuova, another hard-right party, and has identified with the right\u2019s conservative values. However, she told the daily La Stampa in 2023 that she was \u201coffended when they call me a little fascist.\u2019\u2019",
      "La Fenice\u2019s unions say they are not contesting Venezi\u2019s youth, gender or political leanings, but the lack of consultations with the musicians whom she must lead. They note that Colabianchi had pledged an open process just days before Venezi\u2019s appointment was announced.",

      "La Fenice\u2019s unions have asked Colabianchi to revoke Venezi\u2019s appointment, and relaunch the selection process, allowing the musicians time to work with and become familiar with any candidates, Venezi included. They also have demanded Colabianchi's resignation.",
      "Colabianchi, for his part, has apologized for hiring Venezi without more consultations, but he remains firm in his choice.",
      "\u2018\u2019I chose Beatrice Venezi because I had invited her, while I was the general manager in Caglieri, for three separate operas, and she was a huge success,'' Colabianchi said, adding she has a broad repertoire of more than 50 operas. \"She is young, and we need to promote the young; she is a woman, and we need to promote women.\u2019\u2019",
      "He said there was no question of his resigning and that he would bring Venezi to the theater as soon as the protests against her appointment cease. Her first appointment to conduct with the full orchestra would be in July, for a concert in St. Mark\u2019s Square, though others could be added earlier, Colabianchi said.",

      "The prizes honor both literary merit and the writers' promotion of peace through their work, with separate awards annually for fiction, nonfiction and lifetime achievement. The Ohio city was the site of negotiations that led to the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, ending a war in the Balkans marked by ethnic cleansing that killed more than 300,000 people, as well as the displacement of 1 million residents.",
      "The 78-year-old Rushdie is best known for his 1988 novel, \u201cThe Satanic Verses,\u201d which includes a dream sequence about the Prophet Muhammad that prompted allegations of blasphemy and a 1989 call from Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini for the Indian-born writer's death, driving him into hiding. He was blinded in one eye from the 2022 attack before a stunned audience, and his assailant \u2014 who wasn't born when \u201cThe Satanic Verses\u201d was published \u2014 was sentenced to 25 years in prison.",
      "In accepting his award, Rushdie said it can be difficult to write about peace while living in a time of \u201cinexcusable violence,\u201d including the conflicts in Ukraine, Gaza and Sudan.",
      "\u201cA book cannot stop a bullet. A poem cannot intercept a bomb,\" he said.",

      "Authorities said Rushdie's attacker, Hadi Matar, then 24 and a U.S. citizen, was attempting to carry out the decades-old edict calling for his death when he traveled from his home in Fairview, New Jersey, to target the writer at the summer retreat of Chautauqua, New York, about 70 miles (110 kilometers) southwest of Buffalo.",
      "Rushdie published an acclaimed memoir about the attack, \u201cKnife,\u201d in 2024, a finalist for the National Book Award for Nonfiction. His most recent work, his 23rd, is \u201cThe Eleventh Hour,\u201d which includes three novellas and two short stories.",

Holbrooke Distinguished Achievement Award, is named for the American diplomat who was an architect of the Dayton Peace Accords.",

      "Lea Michele returns to Broadway's Imperial Theatre, where she first heard a song from \u201cChess\u201d as a child",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lea Michele was just a kid actor backstage at the Imperial Theatre on Broadway when she first heard a song from the musical \u201cChess\u201d on a stereo. Some three decades later, she finds herself singing that same tune in the same theater.",
      "The \u201cGlee\u201d and Broadway veteran, who got her professional start in \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d at age 8, has returned, now a mother and a bankable star, to her old stomping grounds, which coincidentally is the very theater where \u201cChess\u201d made its debut in 1988.",
      "\u201cThe Imperial Theatre really has a soul. Every show that\u2019s ever been in it is absorbed in the walls. It\u2019s a little eerie, but very powerful. Other theaters can feel a little sterile, but this does not feel that way,\u201d she says.",
      "She remembers exactly where she sat the first time she saw \u201cLes Mis\u00e9rables\u201d \u2014 orchestra left, six rows in \u2014 hearing Paige O\u2019Hara as Fantine sing \u201cI Dreamed a Dream\u201d in the musical that she would soon join, playing Young Cosette and Young Eponine.",
      "\u201cI was in the show and I told my parents, I said \u2018I love this. I want to do this for the rest of my life.\u2019 And it\u2019s really very emotional to be here 30 years later still working, thank God, back at this theater,\u201d she says. The icing on the cake? An electrician on her return simply said: \u201cWelcome home.\u201d",
      "\u201cChess,\u201d which opens Nov. 16 and is set primarily in Bangkok and Budapest during the Cold War, tells the fictional story about two chess grandmasters \u2014 an American played by Aaron Tveit and a Soviet, portrayed by Nicholas Christopher \u2014 facing off to win for their respective nations, a task complicated by the appearance of a woman they both love, played by Michele.",
      "\u201cThis is the hardest character in a lot of ways that I\u2019ve ever played,\u201d Michele says. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s strong. I don\u2019t have comedy to lean on as a crutch or as a kind of like a protective cloak.\u201d",
      "The show reunites Michele with Tony Award-winning director Michael Mayer, who directed her both in her breakout \u201c Spring Awakening \u201d in 2006 and also in \u201cFunny Girl\u201d in 2022.",
      "Mayer also has great memories of the Imperial Theatre. It was the place where he saw his first Broadway show \u2014 \u201cPippin\u201d in 1976 with Ben Vereen. He was in the back row of the mezzanine, eight seats in from the right aisle. \u201cI sat there and everything came back,\u201d he says.",
      "The show, with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Bjorn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson of ABBA, originated as a concept album in 1984 and includes the goosebump-raising \u201cAnthem,\u201d the pop-pulsing \u201cOne Night in Bangkok\u201d\u2014 which reached No. 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 \u2014 and the lilting \u201cI Know Him So Well.\u201d",
      "The musical, first staged in London in 1986 and heavily revised for a Broadway production in 1988, has a cult fan base, but the Broadway production was a flop, lasting less than 90 performances. Attempts have been made to resuscitate it over the years with concerts and new stagings. A new story has been written for the latest iteration by screenwriter Danny Strong.",

      "\u201cI think we\u2019re just really excited for people to see what we\u2019ve been able to do. We\u2019re not ignoring the history of our show, but we just know what we have and I think that it will really all make a lot of sense once everyone gets to see it.\u201d",
      "The relationship between Michele and Mayer has evolved and deepened over the 25 or so years they've known each other. He says he's watched her grow up and no longer feels like a father figure. Now they're peers.",
      "\u201cI feel like we\u2019re not just colleagues, but we\u2019re dear friends. I would almost say we\u2019re family at this point,\u201d he says. \u201cI met her when she was 14 years old. We\u2019ve been in each other\u2019s lives for many, many years now. And being able to work together and have that sort of shorthand has been amazing.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The theft of the Louvre's crown jewels has increased calls for the museum to be more transparent about the colonial origins of the treasures it displays",
      "PARIS -- As French police race to track where the Louvre's stolen crown jewels have gone, a growing chorus wants a brighter light on where they came from.",
      "The artifacts were French, but the gems were not. Their exotic routes to Paris run through the shadows of empire \u2014 an uncomfortable history that France, like other Western nations with treasure-filled museums, has only begun to confront.",
      "The attention sparked by the heist is an opportunity, experts say, to pressure the Louvre and Europe\u2019s great museums to explain their collections' origins more honestly, and it could trigger a broader reckoning over restitutions.",
      "Within hours of the theft, researchers sketched a likely colonial-era map for the materials: sapphires from Ceylon (Sri Lanka), diamonds from India and Brazil, pearls from the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean and emeralds from Colombia.",
      "That doesn\u2019t make the Louvre robbery less criminal. It does complicate the public's understanding of what was lost.",
      "\u201cThere is obviously no excuse for theft,\u201d said Emiline C.H. Smith, a criminologist at the University of Glasgow who studies heritage crime. \u201cBut many of these objects are entangled with violent, exploitative, colonial histories.\u201d",
      "While there\u2019s no credible evidence these specific gems were stolen \u2014 experts say that doesn\u2019t end the argument: What was legal in the imperial age could still mean plunder in today\u2019s lights. In other words, the paperwork of empire doesn\u2019t settle the ethics.",
      "Meanwhile, the heist investigation grinds on. Police have charged suspects, but investigators fear the jewels could be broken up or melted down. They are too symbolic to fence, but easy to monetize for metal and stones.",
      "The Louvre provides scant information about how the gems in the French crown jewels \u2013 showcased in the Apollo Gallery until the theft \u2014 were originally extracted.",
      "For example, the Louvre\u2019s own catalog describes the stolen diadem of Queen Marie-Am\u00e9lie as set with \u201cCeylon sapphires\u201d in their natural, unheated state, bordered with diamonds in gold. It says nothing about who mined them, how they moved, or under what terms they were taken.",
      "Provenance isn\u2019t always a neutral ledger in Western museums. They sometimes \u201cavoid spotlighting uncomfortable acquisition histories,\u201d Smith said, adding that the lack of clarity about the gems\u2019 origins is likely no accident.",
      "The museum did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The stolen tiaras, necklaces and brooches were crafted in Paris by elite ateliers, and once belonged to 19th-century figures such as Marie-Am\u00e9lie, Queen Hortense, and the wives of two Napoleons, Empress Marie-Louise of Austria and Empress Eug\u00e9nie. Their raw materials, however, moved through imperial networks that converted global labor, resources \u2014 and even slavery \u2014 into European prestige, experts say.",
      "Pascal Blanchard, a historian of France\u2019s colonial past, draws a line between craftsmanship and supply. The jewels \u201cwere made in France by French artisans,\u201d he said, but many stones came via colonial circuits and were \u201cproducts of colonial production.\u201d They were traded \u201cunder the legal conditions \u2026 of the time,\u201d ones shaped by empires that siphoned wealth from Africa, Asia and South America.",
      "Some French critics press the point further. They argue that national outcry over loss should sit beside the history of how imperial France acquired the stones that court jewelers later set in gold.",
      "India is waging the best-known battle over a single colonial-era treasure \u2014 the Koh-i-Noor diamond.",

      "India has repeatedly pressed the U.K. to return the mythologized 106-carat jewel, now set in the Queen Mother\u2019s crown at the Tower of London. It likely originated in India's Golconda diamond belt \u2014 much like the Louvre's dazzling Regent diamond, one that was also legally acquired in imperial times and spared by the Oct. 19 robbers.",
      "The Koh-i-Noor passed from court to court before landing in British hands, where it is hailed in London as a \u201clawful\u201d imperial gift and denounced in India as a prize taken under the shadow of conquest. A 2017 petition to India\u2019s Supreme Court seeking its return was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, but the political and moral dispute endures.",
      "France is not Britain, and the Koh-i-Noor is not the Louvre's story. But it frames the questions increasingly applied to 19th-century acquisitions: not only \u201cwas it bought?\u201d but \u201cwho had the power to sell?\u201d On that measure, experts say, even jewels made in France can be considered products of colonial extraction.",
      "The Louvre case lands in a world already primed by other fights. Greece presses Britain to reunite the Parthenon Marbles. Egypt campaigns for the Rosetta Stone in London and the Nefertiti bust in Berlin.",
      "France has moved \u2014 narrowly. President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s pledge to return parts of Africa\u2019s heritage produced a law enabling the return of 26 royal treasures to Benin and items to Senegal. Madagascar recovered the crown of Queen Ranavalona III through a specific process.",
      "Critics say restitution is structurally blocked: French law forbids removing state-held objects unless Parliament makes a special exception, and risk-averse museums keep the rest behind glass.",
      "They also say that under former Louvre chief Jean-Luc Martinez, the museum's narrow definition of what counts as \u201clooted\u201d \u2014 and its demand for near-legal levels of proof \u2014 created a chilling effect on restitution claims, even as the museum publicly praised transparency. (The Louvre says it follows the law and academic standards.)",
      "Asking museum visitors to marvel at artifacts like the French crown jewels without understanding their social history is dishonest, says Erin L. Thompson, an art-crime scholar in New York. A decolonized approach, she and others argue, would name where such stones came from, how the trade worked, who profited and who paid \u2014 and share authorship with origin communities.",
      "Egyptian archaeologist Monica Hanna calls the contradiction glaring.",
      "\u201cYes, the irony is profound,\u201d she said of the outcry over last month's Louvre theft, \u201cand it\u2019s central to the conversation about restitution.\u201d She expects the heist will trigger action on restitutions across Western museums and fuel debate about transparency.",
      "At a minimum, Hanna and other experts say, what's needed from museums are stronger words: plain-spoken labels and wall texts that acknowledge where objects came from, how they moved, and at whose expense. It would mean publishing what is known, admitting what isn\u2019t, and inviting contested histories into the gallery \u2014 even when they cloud the shine.",
      "Some offer a practical path.",
      "\u201cTell the honest and complete story,\u201d said Dutch restitution specialist Jos van Beurden. \u201cOpen the windows, not for thieves, but for fresh air.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The 2026 Grammy Award nominations are almost here. And the competition will be stiff.",
      "Nominees will be announced during a video livestream on the Grammy website and the Recording Academy\u2019s YouTube channel on Friday at 8 a.m. Pacific and 11 a.m. Eastern.",
      "A host of talent is on deck to announce the nominees, including Gayle King, Doechii, Karol G, Lizzo, Mumford & Sons, Nicole Scherzinger, Sabrina Carpenter, Sam Smith, Ang\u00e9lique Kidjo, Brandi Carlile, CeCe Winans, David Foster, Jon Batiste, Little Big Town, Masaki Koike and last year's best new artist winner, Chappell Roan.",
      "Only recordings commercially released in the U.S. between Aug. 31, 2024 through Aug. 30, 2025 are eligible for nominations, so don\u2019t expect to see Taylor Swift's \u201cThe Life of a Showgirl\u201d included. But do expect to see Carpenter's \u201cMan's Best Friend\u201d among the nominees; it was released just under the wire on August 29.",
      "That might have a little something to do with the new addition of a stand-alone category for best album cover. Carpenter sparked considerable discourse when its artwork was revealed; it shows the pop star kneeling on the ground in a dog-like pose while an unseen person pulls her by the hair.",
      "There are plenty of unknowns going into the nomination announcements, too. The most obvious contenders for album of the year did not release new full-lengths within the eligibility window \u2014 artists like Swift, Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele. But there have been a few heavy hitters, like Kendrick Lamar's \u201cGNX,\" Lady Gaga's \u201cMayhem\u201d and Bad Bunny's \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos.\u201d If any of them took home the top prize, it would be for the first time.",

      "This year\u2019s \u201cWhere We Are on TV\u201d study, released Thursday, counted 489 LGBTQ characters across scripted prime-time broadcast, cable and streaming shows \u2014 up 21 additional characters. It marks a boost after two years of decline, but remains far below the 2021-2022 record high of 775 characters.",
      "Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of the group, warned that those numbers could still decrease soon: More than 200 of the LGBTQ+ characters counted this year \u2014 in shows like \"Heartstopper,\" \"Harlem\" and \"Elite\" \u2014 will not be returning due to a flurry of series cancellations, endings or because they were limited series.",
      "\u201cStorytelling brings us together and this current cultural and political climate calls on creatives and executives to double down on fair and accurate stories of LGBTQ people,\u201d Ellis writes in the report.",
      "GLAAD added that the number of transgender characters on TV has slightly increased from last year to reach 33 \u2014 trans women, seven trans men, and two nonbinary characters \u2014 but only four trans characters appear on series that have been officially renewed.",
      "The report is the 20th edition of the annual tracking by GLAAD and charts a remarkable leap from just 47 LGBTQ+ characters in the first study. It arrives as President Donald Trump has targeted transgender and nonbinary people with a series of executive orders \u2014 including one declaring the existence of two unchangeable sexes \u2014 stripping government websites of \u201cgender ideology\u201d an reinstituting a ban on transgender service members in the military.",
      "A recent Gallup poll found 9.3% of U.S. adults identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or something other than straight or heterosexual. The percentage has more than doubled since Gallup first measured LGBTQ+ identification in 2012.",
      "The GLAAD study found that representation on broadcast and cable have continually declined, while streaming programming saw an increase of LGBTQ+ characters.",

This year\u2019s report does not include a challenge tied to a specific percentage.",

      "France's court of auditors has urged the Louvre museum to prioritize security modernization",
      "PARIS -- France's court of auditors urged the Louvre museum to speed up its security modernization plans as a priority, in a report conducted before the Oct. 19 jewels heist that noted major delays in the renovation of the world\u2019s most-visited museum.",
      "Thursday\u2019s report by the Cour des Comptes comes after a series of failings and security issues came to light following the robbery of the $102-million worth Crown Jewels that shocked the world. The thieves used a truck-mounted basket lift to reach a window of the Apollo Gallery and fled with the trove within minutes.",
      "\u201cThe theft of the crown jewels is undoubtedly a deafening alarm bell,\u201d Pierre Moscovici, head of the court of auditors, said at a news conference.",
      "The report, focusing on the 2018-2024 period, said the museum's investments prioritized \u201cvisible and attractive operations\u201d like buying new pieces of art and improving visitor experience. That was \u201cat the expense of the maintenance and renovation of buildings and technical installations, particularly safety and security systems,\u201d it said.",
      "A plan to modernize security equipment was being studied since 2018 but its implementation kept being delayed, the report said. Actual technical work was only to start next year and was planned to be fully implemented by 2032.",
      "\"The pace is far too slow,\" Moscovici said.",
      "The court of auditors believes security can be improved without hiring more staff at the museum, Moscovici added. A previous assessment shows that the Oct. 19 heist was made possible by outdated security systems, not because of lack of staff, he said.",
      "The cost for security modernization is estimated to 83 million euros ($95 million), out of which only 3 million euros ($3.5 million) have been invested between 2018 and 2024, according to the report.",
      "The museum said that over the past three years, 134 digital cameras have been installed to supplement or replace outdated cameras throughout the museum, the report noted.",

      "The court of auditors, which is an independent body, recommended that the Louvre focuses on priorities including bringing the museum\u2019s technical facilities, particularly safety and security, up to standards, and cut its expenses in other areas. That means reducing art acquisition and saving on museum rooms' renovation projects, the report said.",
      "In response to the audit, the Louvre on Thursday said it \u201cregretted\u201d that the report did not take into account the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis and the 2024 Paris Olympics, which the museum said impacted certain decisions.",
      "The Louvre said it agrees with most of the court of auditors\u2019 recommendations and already made similar proposals. It noted that the Oct. 19 theft occurred weeks before planned security improvements were to start being implemented.",
      "The decade-long \u201cLouvre New Renaissance\u201d plan, which includes security improvements, was launched earlier this year. It is estimated it would cost up to 800 million euros ($933 million) to modernize infrastructure, ease crowding and give the famed Mona Lisa a dedicated gallery by 2031.",
      "Last week, Culture Minister Rachida Dati said the Louvre will install streetside anti-ramming and anti-intrusion devices in the next two months, following a provisional investigation that found a \u201cchronic, structural underestimation\u201d of the risk of theft at the Paris landmark.",
      "Dati acknowledged \u201csecurity gaps,\u201d refused the resignation of the museum director and cited four failings: underestimated risk, underequipped security, ill-suited governance and \u201cobsolete\u201d protocols.",
      "Four suspects in the Louvre heist were arrested last week, including three believed to be members of the team of four that was filmed using a basket lift to reach the museum\u2019s window. They face preliminary charges of theft by an organized gang and criminal conspiracy. The jewels have not been recovered, authorities said.",

      "Joachim Trier's \u201cSentimental Value\" builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life",
      "NEW YORK -- Joachim Trier, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd and Renate Reinsve have gathered in a backstage room at Lincoln Center\u2019s Alice Tully Hall. A screen on the wall shows the crowd inside, raptly watching their film, \u201cSentimental Value.\u201d They have all consciously sat facing away from the movie.",
      "But if there\u2019s one moment from the film they sometimes sneak in for, it\u2019s the final scene. At festivals, they\u2019ve sometimes taken the stage for a Q&A with tears still in their eyes.",
      "\u201cThe ending always moves me,\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd says. \u201cOn the paper, it really scared me. It could have been sentimental hell, not \u2018Sentimental Value.\u2019 What was important to me was that nothing was resolved. I hate the word closure. There\u2019s no closure in life. But there\u2019s something more beautiful.\u201d",
      "\u201cSentimental Value,\u201d written and directed by Trier, builds its emotional power subtly through scenes that, like much of the acclaimed Danish-Norwegian filmmaker\u2019s filmography, pulse with the rhythm of life. By the time the film reaches its crescendo, a simple exchange of looks is enough to leave you stirred to your core.",
      "That effect isn\u2019t new to fans of Trier\u2019s previous films, like \u201cOslo, August 31st\u201d or his previous one, \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d which starred Reinsve. But \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d which Neon opens in theaters Friday, is uniquely personal statement for Trier that also happens \u2014 because it\u2019s so much about the intermingling of life and art, and how one enriches the other \u2014 to resonate deeply with his two stars.",
      "Skarsg\u00e5rd plays the venerated filmmaker Gustav Borg, who has long been estranged from his family. But after the death of his ex-wife, Borg comes back into the lives of his daughters Nora (Reinsve) and Agnes (Inga Ibsdotter Lilleaas). Like her father, Nora is tough and stubborn, and her outlet is in performance. Gustav wants her to star in his new and highly autobiographical film, a project that also draws the interest of an American starlet (Elle Fanning).",
      "Both Reinsve and Skarsg\u00e5rd have direct similarities to their character. Reinsve, 37, experienced a breakthrough in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Skarsg\u00e5rd, 74, is the father of eight, many of them actors. But \u201cSentimental Value,\" the Grand Prix winner at the Cannes Film Festival, has deeper reverberations for them, and for Trier. In a conversation that, like one of Trier's films, featured embraces and tears and the gratification of feeling seen, the three reflected on making a film poised between life and fiction.",
      "REINSVE: For me it was nerve-racking because he knows me so well. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to find. He\u2019s very smart and very wise, so what he finds is probably the truth.",
      "TRIER: The revealing of something in art is what interests us. So one might think I know too well what to do, but it\u2019s a compliment to these actors that they\u2019re able to come into a position of control and craft and yet (laughs) unhinge themselves in unusual ways in front of the camera. You want that. You yearn for it. What, you were worried I\u2019ll reveal something you don\u2019t want to show?",
      "REINSVE: Yeah.",
      "TRIER: But you are so brave.",
      "REINSVE: But I became brave with you. In the theater, I worked on a lot of characters that you build and construct. You\u2019re making it big for the audience. Playing Julie in \u201cThe Worst Person in the World,\u201d you encouraged me to let go of that. I remember one of our first conversations, I was worried because I didn\u2019t know how to build her. And you said, \u201cBut do you have to? Can\u2019t you just find it in you?\u201d For me that was so scary.",
      "SKARSGARD: It\u2019s flattering in a way, but you\u2019re not sure if it\u2019s flattering. The character on the paper wasn\u2019t really what he is in the film. I remember I said to you, \u201cCan\u2019t you get over your problems with your father?\u201d",
      "TRIER: And I said, (voice intentionally squeaking) \u201cI\u2019m over them!\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: The hard edges of the character were very obvious in the script, but the compassion wasn\u2019t.",
      "TRIER: When you came into it, that solved it. I mean, character is something that happens with actors.",

      "REINSVE: Before I worked with Joachim, I played a lot of characters that keep their emotions really inside and aren\u2019t able to let them out. Joachim built that trust because of how he worked and how he sees people. It was safe to let go of something in there. He sits beside the camera and whispers. He can tap into the actor\u2019s instinct. I\u2019m a person or an actor who has a lot of resistance, which is good for the dynamic in a character. But it can also hinder you from letting go of something you need to. Joachim sits there and knows what the actor wants to do and he says, \u201cLet yourself do it.\u201d It feels like we\u2019re doing it together.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019ve always seen acting as a way of being able to do what you can\u2019t do in your private life. I\u2019m pretty reserved, in a way. I am!",
      "REINSVE: Not with us.",
      "TRIER: I hear you say that!",
      "SKARSGARD: But it\u2019s fantastic to have this art where you can also test everything. Can I feel that? Wow! Yeah! It\u2019s like a child playing in a sandbox. It\u2019s the same mechanism. They play other people from day one. Maybe it\u2019s evolutionary: mimicking the adults to survive.",
      "REINSVE: We\u2019re still children mimicking the adults.",
      "TRIER: It\u2019s funny because a lot of people have trouble making art of a personal sort. They sing a strange, sensual love song in a band and they\u2019re shy that their parents will hear it. Or you write a book that\u2019s transgressive. I'm the opposite. I\u2019m rather proud that I've done personal films because my kids will see them. Maybe they\u2019ll see them and think they\u2019re stupid or my opinions are weird. That\u2019s OK, but they were me. I think this film came out of a climate in my life when I was thinking about these things.",
      "TRIER: That was when I knew I had the film I wanted to make, when I had the idea of ending. We were all nervous about it. The last day of the shoot. I\u2019m so proud of you two. My dream came true.",
      "SKARSGARD: I\u2019m glad that you say I have a rhythm because I really care about rhythm. Scenes are to me like music pieces. He wrote this for me and the (expletive) and he\u2019s seen what I\u2019ve been longing for: the acting between the lines. (Skarsg\u00e5rd begins tearing up.) I\u2019m getting emotional.",
      "TRIER: I think you are incredibly smart with screenwriting, so much so that I was nervous going in. You\u2019re very blunt in a very warm way. You say \u201c(Expletive) this\u201d or \u201cYou don\u2019t need this.\u201d",
      "SKARSGARD: It's being allowed to do a film that\u2019s not written in a head of a director. He\u2019s exploring it. There\u2019s nothing like it. (Again Skarsg\u00e5rd gets emotional before shaking his head.) Enough!",
      "REINSVE: This is it. I feel this moment is it. It brings to the surface something we're longing for. The human mind needs to create a narrative and make things black or white to protect itself. That\u2019s a problem in the world, being so polarized. The wisdom is being safe enough to create a space to let anything happen and see the nuances between people. There are no sets like Joachim\u2019s sets. It's a process \u2014 what is it? Art creates life, imitates\u2026",
      "SKARSGARD: You never get it right.",
      "REINSVE: I never get it right. But it\u2019s both ways! Here, art imitates life, life imitates art. It\u2019s both ways.",

      "NEW YORK -- A once-overlooked army psychiatrist tasked with analyzing Hermann G\u00f6ring and other Nazis accused of war crimes is getting the kind of attention that he had sought in his lifetime.",
      "\u201cNuremberg,\u201d starring Russell Crowe as G\u00f6ring, centers on the Nazi military commander's conversations with Dr. Douglas M. Kelley, played by Rami Malek. Kelley's mission was to determine whether G\u00f6ring and more than 20 other Nazi officials captured at the end of World War II were fit to stand trial in Nuremberg. The movie is directed by James Vanderbilt and based on a 2013 book, \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d by Jack El-Hai, who helped Vanderbilt write the screenplay.",
      "Through many hours at facilities in Luxembourg and Nuremberg, Kelley will find himself alternately taken and frightened by a man notorious for his role in the Nazis' attempted conquest of Europe and beyond. G\u00f6ring turns out to be unexpectedly good and clever company, if not convincing in his assertion that he knew nothing of Hitler\u2019s worst atrocities and cared only to restore Germany to greatness after its humiliating defeat in World War I.",

      "Kelley, an ambitious and demonstrative man who took his own life in 1958, might never have inspired a major Hollywood production had his name not turned up while El-Hai was working on a previous book. While writing about Dr. Walter Freeman, who helped make lobotomy a common treatment, El-Hai came upon an encounter between Freeman and Kelley at an American Psychiatric Association gathering in the late 1930s.",
      "\u201cWhat struck Freeman about Kelley was that Kelley was not there to present a paper or do anything like that. He was there to give a magic show on the stage to entertain all his fellow psychiatrists,\u201d El-Hai told The Associated Press. \u201cSo a few years after I finished \u2018The Lobotomy,\u2019 I decided to find out what I could about Dr. Kelley\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "El-Hai got in touch with Kelley's eldest child, Doug, who gave him access to a trove of his father's archives, some 15 boxes containing everything from medical records to a package of cookies Nazi leader Rudolf Hess refused to eat out of fear they had been poisoned. In \u201cThe Nazi and the Psychiatrist,\u201d El-Hai follows Kelley's life from his rise in the psychiatric profession through the controversies of his years after returning home from Europe, starting with his contention that in the U.S. there are people who, to gain power, \u201cwould willingly climb over the corpses of half of the American public.\u201d",
      "As a professor of criminology at the University of California, Berkeley, Kelley was a showman in the classroom who cracked jokes, drew elaborate designs and performed magic tricks. As a consultant to the Berkeley Police Department, he openly challenged the competence of law enforcement officials and was eventually monitored by the FBI, which suspected him of political subversion. He also gave lectures around the country and published a book about his wartime findings, \u201c22 Cells in Nuremberg,\u201d which sold few copies and is long out of print.",
      "His death echoed the suicide of G\u00f6ring, who 12 years earlier had taken a cyanide pill he\u2019d hidden in his cell. G\u00f6ring\u2019s life ended in secret, Kelley\u2019s in front of his family. After a loud argument with his wife, he rushed upstairs to his study, reemerged with a cyanide capsule in his hand and shouted \u201cI don\u2019t have to take this anymore!\u201d Kelley left no explanation. His son, according to El-Hai, believed he had been overcome by his \u201cemotions and inner pain.\u201d",

      "EL-HAI: One of Kelley\u2019s central questions that he had going into this work was the question that was strongly of interest to me: Did these men who were all defendants in this first Nuremberg trial share any psychiatric disorders, illness, his personality traits, any of that? And Kelley found to his disappointment that they did not \u2014 none of them, with the possible exception of (German Labor Front leader) Robert Ley, who killed himself before the trial. They certainly had neuroses, but many people who function normally have neuroses. That made him afraid and made him believe that people like that are in our population in far greater numbers than any of us.",
      "They were all people who believed that the ends justify the means and that most of them were, on a personal level, on a quest for power. And that was more important than ideology. So they would attach themselves to an ideology that allowed them to rise and to crush anybody else who got in their way.",
      "El-HAI: There was very little remorse.",
      "El-HAI: He wanted to be treated as a head of state, which he considered himself to be. He said to some of his fellow defendants, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, before much time goes by, there will be statues of us all over Germany.\u201d",
      "El-HAI: Especially if the alternative was to be hanged, which they all considered to be an execution method for a common criminal. Kelley observed that by poisoning himself right before the execution, G\u00f6ring was putting a thumb in the eye of the American authorities. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to do with what you want to do with me.\u201d And that really resonated with Kelley.",
      "EL-HAI: It was not a concern of mine. As a result of the courtroom scenes that are in the second half of the film, G\u00f6ring loses a lot of his luster, as happened in the real courtroom. Rami, in playing the counterpoint to the villainous G\u00f6ring, maybe had to think about it more, because I have always seen those two characters as being more similar than not similar.",
      "When I was writing the book, I often discussed with Dr. Kelley\u2019s son, Doug, what it must have been like for them to be in this jail cell together, and we always jokingly characterized them as King Kong versus Godzilla. They were both egomaniacs. They were both absolutely certain of their rightness. And they were both socially charming and highly intelligent.",
      "EL-HAI: I was OK with James Vanderbilt\u2019s approach from the start. Whenever he would send me a draft of the screenplay, I didn\u2019t see it as my job to find inaccuracies and things that weren\u2019t factual.

      "NEW YORK -- Bad Company singer-songwriter Paul Rodgers treasures one of his last phone calls with guitarist Mick Ralphs. It was to deliver the news that, at long last, they'd been inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.",
      "\u201cI said to him, \u2018Do you remember when we were looking for a band name and we called each other with silly names?' And then I just called him up one day and I said, \u2019Bad Company' and he dropped the phone and he said, \u2018Oh yeah, that\u2019s it. That's the name,\u2019\u201d says Rodgers.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018From then, it\u2019s a long way, but it seems like we just blinked our eyes a couple of times and here we are at the Hall of Fame.\u2019 So at least I was able to tell him that.\u201d",
      "Ralphs died in June, just weeks after learning the induction news.",

ABC will air a prime-time special on Jan. 1, available on Hulu the next day.",
      "\u201cThe fans have just been so great throughout the years. We feel like we\u2019re celebrated, but it\u2019s just not been stamped officially. That\u2019s the only difference,\u201d says Rodgers.",
      "Bad Company will join rock legend Chubby Checker, late soul singer Joe Cocker, pop icon Cyndi Lauper, hip-hop pioneers Outkast, rock duo the White Stripes and grunge masters Soundgarden in the class of \u201925.",

      "International health experts say Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America",
      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",
      "In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said.",

      "A major question now is if either are linked to the Texas outbreak. To lose elimination status, health data must show a continuous chain of measles spread for one year.",
      "International health officials have recommended the U.S. \u201cenhance case investigation protocols,\u201d because closing data gaps is key to stopping the virus from taking hold again, said Dr. Daniel Salas, who leads immunization efforts at the Pan American Health Organization.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 1,681 cases and 44 outbreaks this year, making it the worst year for measles in the U.S. in more than three decades. Only nine states haven\u2019t confirmed cases, according to the CDC.",
      "A large outbreak also continues in Chihuahua, Mexico, where health officials have confirmed 4,430 cases as of last week and 21 deaths, according to state health data.",

      "The request is the latest in a flurry of legal activity over how the program that helps 42 million Americans buy groceries should proceed during the historic U.S. government shutdown. Lower courts have ruled that the government must keep full payments flowing, but the Trump administration is asking the Supreme Court to keep them frozen for now.",

Johnson said she has been skipping meals the past two weeks to make sure her three teenage children have something to eat. She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.",

      "The Senate Monday passed a compromise funding package that would end the government shutdown and refill SNAP funds. It now goes to the House for consideration.",
      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",
      "Millions more people still have not received SNAP payments for November, because their states were waiting on guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers SNAP.

      "Trump\u2019s administration has argued that the judicial order to provide full benefits violates the Constitution by infringing on the spending power of the legislative and executive branches.",
      "Wisconsin, which was among the first to load full benefits after McConnell\u2019s order, had its federal reimbursement frozen.

Dozens of clinical trials are testing ways to reprogram an immune system-gone-rogue, with some promising early successes against lupus, myositis and certain other illnesses. Other researchers are hunting ways to at least delay brewing autoimmune diseases, spurred by a drug that can buy some time before people show symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Here are some things to know.",
      "They\u2019re chronic diseases that can range from mild to life-threatening, more than 100 with different names depending on how and where they do damage. Rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis attack joints. Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s disease is known for dry eyes and mouth. Myositis and myasthenia gravis weaken muscles in different ways, the latter by attacking how nerves signal them. Lupus has widely varied symptoms including a butterfly-shaped facial rash, joint and muscle pain, fevers and damage to the kidneys, lungs and heart.",
      "They\u2019re also capricious: Even patients faring well for long periods can suddenly have a \u201cflare\u201d for no apparent reason.",
      "Many start with vague symptoms that come and go or mimic other illnesses. Many also have overlapping symptoms \u2013 rheumatoid arthritis and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s also can harm major organs, for example.",
      "Diagnosis can take multiple tests, including some blood tests to detect antibodies that mistakenly latch onto healthy tissue. It usually centers on symptoms and involves ruling out other causes. Depending on the disease it can take years and seeing multiple doctors before one puts the clues together. There are efforts to improve: The National MS Society is educating doctors about newly updated guidelines to streamline diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.",
      "The human immune system is a complex army with sentinels to detect threats like germs or cancer cells, a variety of soldiers to attack them, and peacemakers to calm things down once the danger is over.

Scientists say it then takes some \u201cenvironmental\u201d trigger, such as an infection, smoking or pollutants, to set the disease into motion. For example, the Epstein-Barr virus is linked to MS.",
      "Scientists are zeroing in on the earliest molecular triggers. For example, white blood cells called neutrophils are first responders to signs of infection or injury \u2014 but abnormally overactive ones are suspected of playing a key role in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases.",
      "Women account for about 4 of 5 autoimmune patients, many of them young. Hormones are thought to play a role. But also, females have two X chromosomes while males have one X and one Y. Some research suggests an abnormality in how female cells switch off that extra X can increase women\u2019s vulnerability.",

      "It's one of medicine's biggest mysteries \u2014 why sometimes our immune system attacks our own bodies",
      "Doctor after doctor misdiagnosed or shrugged off Ruth Wilson\u2019s rashes, swelling, fevers and severe pain for six years. She saved her life by begging for one more test in an emergency room about to send her home, again, without answers.",
      "That last-ditch test found the Massachusetts woman\u2019s kidneys were failing. The culprit? Her immune system had been attacking her own body all that time and nobody caught it.",
      "\u201cI just wish there was a better way that patients could get that diagnosis without having to go through all of the pain and all of, like, the dismissiveness and the gaslighting,\u201d she said.",
      "Wilson has lupus, nicknamed the disease of 1,000 faces for its variety of symptoms \u2014 and her journey offers a snapshot of the dark side of the immune system. Lupus is one of a rogues\u2019 gallery of autoimmune diseases that affect as many as 50 million Americans and millions more worldwide \u2013 hard to treat, on the rise and one of medicine\u2019s biggest mysteries.",
      "Now, building on discoveries from cancer research and the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists are decoding the biology behind these debilitating illnesses. They\u2019re uncovering pathways that lead to different autoimmune diseases and connections between seemingly unrelated ones \u2013 in hopes of attacking the causes, not just the symptoms.",
      "It's a daunting task. That friendly fire ravages nerves in multiple sclerosis, inflames joints in rheumatoid arthritis, dries out the eyes and mouth in Sj\u00f6gren's disease, destroys insulin production in Type 1 diabetes, weakens muscles in myositis and myasthenia gravis \u2014 and in lupus, it can cause body-wide havoc.",
      "The list goes on: A new count from the National Institutes of Health tallied 140 autoimmune conditions, many rare but altogether a leading cause of chronic disease that\u2019s often invisible.",
      "\u201cYou look normal. People see you and they don\u2019t think you have this horrible disease,\u201d said Wilson, 43, who balances her illness with volunteering to help educate the public and even doctors about life with lupus.",
      "While there\u2019s still an enormous amount to learn, recent steps have some specialists daring to wonder if just maybe, ways to cure or prevent at least some of these diseases are getting closer.",
      "In dozens of clinical trials, scientists are harnessing some of patients' own immune cells to wipe out wayward ones that fuel lupus and a growing list of other diseases. It's called CAR-T therapy and early results with these \u201cliving drugs\u201d are promising. The first lupus patient was treated in Germany in March 2021 and remains in drug-free remission, the researchers said last month.",
      "And a drug named teplizumab can delay the start of Type 1 diabetes symptoms in people destined to get sick, buying some time before they\u2019ll need insulin. Citing that \u201ctantalizing evidence,\u201d the NIH\u2019s new five-year plan for autoimmune research \u2014 if it gets funded \u2014 urges pursuing similar windows to intervene in other simmering diseases.",
      "\u201cThis is probably the most exciting time that we\u2019ve ever had to be in autoimmunity,\u201d said Dr. Amit Saxena, a rheumatologist at NYU Langone Health.",
      "Your immune system has multiple overlapping ways to detect and attack bacteria, viruses or other bad actors. That includes teaching key soldiers -- T cells and antibody-producing B cells \u2014 how to distinguish what\u2019s foreign from what\u2019s \u201cyou.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a delicate balancing act, especially considering germs sometimes adapt features similar to human molecules so they can confuse and sneak past immune defenses. And while the immune system has built-in safeguards to curtail any misbehaving cells, autoimmune diseases set in when the system gets off-kilter.",
      "Numerous genes involved in different immune functions can make people susceptible to common autoimmune diseases. That means if one family member is sick, others may be at increased risk. Such genes can include variants that once protected our ancestors from long-ago threats including the Black Death but that today can translate into a hyperactive immune system.",
      "But \u201cgenes are not everything,\u201d said Dr. Mariana Kaplan of NIH\u2019s National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.",
      "Studies show if one identical twin develops an autoimmune disease, the other isn't guaranteed to get sick. Non-genetic factors that trigger an immune response play a big role, such as infections, certain medicines, smoking, pollutants. In lupus, even a bad sunburn is suspect.",
      "\u201cAt some point there is a second or third hit and the immune system says, \u2018That\u2019s it, I can\u2019t handle any more of these insults,\u2019\u201d said Kaplan, who directs systemic autoimmunity research.",
      "And women are more likely to get autoimmune diseases than men, maybe because of estrogen or their extra X chromosome. That's especially evident in lupus; women account for 90% of cases, often young ones like Wilson.",
      "Fainting spells and body-wide rashes began in her 20s and intensified with two pregnancies. Youngsters in tow, she saw a variety of doctors for fevers, swelling, joint and back pain until that fateful ER visit when she requested a urine test.",
      "Months of grueling treatment saved her kidneys. But over a decade later, the Littleton, Massachusetts, woman still lives with daily pain from lupus. Deep fatigue and brain fog \u2014 difficulty with concentrating, short-term recall, multitasking \u2014 wax and wane.",
      "Therapies have improved in recent years, from high-dose steroids and drugs that broadly suppress the immune system to include additional options that focus on specific molecules. Wilson gets a monthly lupus-targeted IV treatment and takes about six daily medicines to calm her overactive immune system and related symptoms.",
      "Worse are what are called flares, when symptoms abruptly and markedly worsen. For Wilson, they bring sudden high fevers, legs too swollen to walk, more intense pain, lasting days to a week. They impact her job at a medical lab and time with her husband, teen son and college-age daughter.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad life, it\u2019s just a bad day,\u201d she tells herself to get through.",
      "Kaplan, the NIH scientist, has a biological explanation for the daily slog: The same inflammatory proteins that cause aches and fatigue during a cold or flu continually course through the bodies of patients with systemic autoimmune diseases like lupus.",
      "\u201cThese are my babies,\u201d said Dr. Justin Kwong, a research fellow in Kaplan\u2019s lab at NIH, as he carefully examines cells in an incubator.",
      "Kwong is performing something so tricky it's not done in many laboratories: He's growing batches of neutrophils, the body\u2019s most common white blood cells.",
      "They are first responders that race to the site of an injury or infection, and Kaplan suspects they\u2019re among the earliest immune cells to run amok and trigger certain autoimmune diseases.",
      "How? Some types of neutrophils spew out their insides to form sticky spider-web like structures that trap and kill germs. The neutrophils die in the process.",
      "But patients with lupus and some other diseases harbor abnormal neutrophils that form too many webs, Kaplan said. Her team is investigating if other immune defenses mistakenly sense the resulting debris as foreign, sparking a chain reaction.",
      "\u201cWe think that\u2019s a fundamental initial process,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find why it happens, why it happens more often in women, and can we come up with strategies to stop this without harming the way we defend ourselves from infections.\u201d",
      "Another common feature: Patients with a number of autoimmune diseases, especially women, often suffer heart attacks and strokes at unusually young ages. Kaplan\u2019s research suggests those aptly named NETS, or neutrophil extracellular traps, may be key \u2014 by damaging blood vessels and spurring hardened arteries typically seen in older people.",
      "But neutrophils don\u2019t live long outside the body and testing mature ones from lupus patients\u2019 blood won\u2019t show how they went awry \u2014 something Kwong\u2019s baby neutrophils may aid.",
      "Whatever triggers it, lupus has bafflingly varied symptoms and treatments that can keep some patients symptom-free but not others.",
      "That suggests \u201clupus is not a single disease,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cWhat we call lupus probably represents many different conditions that have some common factors.\"",
      "How to subtype lupus isn't clear. But another disease, rheumatoid arthritis, may offer clues. Perhaps best recognized by painfully disfigured fingers, RA can attack any joint and even some organs, sometimes scarring lungs.",
      "Like with lupus, RA treatment is trial-and-error and scientists are exploring different underlying factors to explain why. In one study, an international team used tiny samples of patients' joint tissue to identify six inflammatory subtypes of RA based on patterns of cells, how they clustered and their activity.",
      "It \u201cchanged how we think about the disease,\u201d said Northwestern University rheumatology chief Harris Perlman, one of the coauthors. Now researchers are comparing cells in joint tissue before and after patients start a new drug to see if they could help guide treatment choices, he said.",
      "Wilson learned to wear sunscreen and a big hat outdoors and how to ration her energy in hopes of avoiding flares. When her kids were old enough for school, she returned, too, getting degrees that led to laboratory research and data science jobs \u2014 and a better understanding of her own disease and its treatments.",
      "One day her then-rheumatologist asked if she'd answer some medical students' questions. Wilson remembers many knew \u201cwhat lupus looks like in a textbook\u201d but not the patient perspective.",
      "\u201cI realized, my god, I need to start talking about this.\u201d",
      "What that looks like now: One evening last February, Wilson bubbled with nerves and excitement at finally meeting some members of her online lupus support group. At UMass Chan Medical School, Wilson greeted the two women and two men with hugs. They shared symptoms and treatments \u2014 and rueful stories of well-meaning relatives urging them to just get more sleep to combat the lupus fatigue that rest can't conquer.",
      "A month later, Wilson traveled to Washington for a meeting organized by the Lupus Research Alliance, where she urged scientists and drug company researchers to heed patient reports of changes in their everyday lives, such as whether a new therapy helps brain fog.",
      "Drug studies that measure physical symptoms and blood markers are \u201conly capturing half the story,\u201d she said. \u201cIf a treatment allows me to think clearly, to engage in my life, to be the person I know I am beneath all of this, then that is just as important as reducing inflammation.\u201d",
      "While her doctor isn't recommending experimental treatments yet, Wilson recently joined the Lupus Landmark Study that will track biological samples from 3,500 patients to better understand disease variations. Whenever a flare strikes Wilson pricks her finger for a blood sample to share.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important for me to also be a voice for patients because I think of myself and how lonely I was at the very beginning,\u201d Wilson said. For a long time, \u201cI never wanted to talk about it. Especially my kids, I wanted them to know that I was going to be OK. And so you put on your makeup and your lipstick and your three shades of eye corrector and you go on.\u201d",

Environment Programme.",
      "It's not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.",
      "People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.",
      "They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.",

      "New Zealand's government has announced changes to firearms laws Tuesday which include ending police officer involvement in gun regulation",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand\u2019s government will end the involvement of police officers in regulating gun ownership, an official said Tuesday as she announced sweeping firearms law reforms.",
      "The move is intended to ease tensions between the gun regulator and firearms owners, which have been fraught since the agency's creation following a shooting massacre at two New Zealand mosques.",
      "The Firearms Safety Authority has overseen gun ownership since 2022 after an inquiry underlined the way the white supremacist attacker legally acquired numerous weapons without attracting law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "The changes unveiled in Wellington by Associate Justice Minister Nicole McKee stopped short of what the police union and those bereaved in the Christchurch massacre feared: a reversal of the near-complete ban on semiautomatic firearms passed after the attacker killed 51 Muslims at prayer on March 15, 2019.",
      "McKee, a lobbyist for gun owners before she entered parliament in 2020, told reporters her bid to relax the semiautomatic weapons ban for some sports shooters wasn\u2019t approved by the Cabinet. Her government had refused to rule out reversing the ban before.",
      "Instead, her changes focused on removing uniformed officers from the regulatory body and altering its oversight. Once McKee's law passes, the authority will report directly to the government, rather than the head of the New Zealand Police.",
      "\u201cThere will be no blue shirts in the Firearms Safety Authority,\u201d McKee said, referring to police uniforms. The 15 officers who worked at the authority would return to police duties, which will still include enforcing gun crime laws.",
      "\u201cWe need to rebuild the trust and confidence between the regulator and the licensed firearms community that has diminished severely over the past six years,\u201d said McKee. She said \u201ca lot of the blame\" for the Christchurch attack was directed at gun owners, who say police should be focusing on law enforcement, not on regulation compliance or licensing.",
      "The regulator is currently a unit within the police department. The law change would create a more independent legal structure that would only share corporate services with the law enforcement agency.",
      "The body couldn't be entirely separated from the police department due to a reliance on law enforcement databases, McKee said.",
      "The Australian attacker, who moved to New Zealand to carry out the massacre, was granted a license and legally amassed semiautomatic weapons after being radicalized online. Lawmakers changed the rules after the attack to require more information from applicants, such as travel histories, and tighter policies about character referees which might have raised questions when Brenton Tarrant applied for a license.",

      "New Zealand drew global admiration when its then-Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said six days after the massacre that the weapons used would be banned. Further reforms included new gun club rules and a firearms registry.",
      "McKee, who opposed most of the changes as a lobbyist, left many untouched in the law rewrite. She said the focus was on simplifying regulations so law-abiding gun owners could comply more easily.",
      "That included extending renewal windows for licenses, which sometimes lapse due to backlogs, and allowing more flexibility in where licensed gun owners can store their weapons. The small number of New Zealanders permitted semiautomatic weapons for pest control will be allowed to hold their licenses for longer.",
      "The new law would also introduce a so-called red flag system enabling other government agencies to share information with the regulator. It would strengthen controls on 3D-printed gun manufacturing, though it stops short of what police had urged.",
      "The legislation replacing the Arms Act was still being drafted and wasn\u2019t publicly available Tuesday. McKee said it would be introduced to Parliament before year\u2019s end and she hoped it would pass by mid-2026. Her libertarian party, Act, is part of a three-party, center-right coalition government that has enough lawmakers to pass the reforms outright.",
      "A spokesperson for the Council of Licensed Firearms Owners, which McKee previously led, said the group welcomed the removal of police from gun licensing. Hugh Devereux-Mack said the structure of the regulator had resulted in \u201cunfair and intimidating treatment\u201d of gun owners.",
      "Devereux-Mack said he was disappointed the law didn\u2019t propose a new definition of who qualifies as a \u201cfit and proper\u201d person to own a gun. He urged gun owners to make submissions on the bill before it passed.",

      "Air travelers could face more frustration as U.S. airports need to meet a higher FAA target for reducing flights",
      "Air travelers could face more frustration as busy U.S. airports need to meet a higher Federal Aviation Administration target for reducing flights Tuesday after already canceling thousands to scale back demands on the nation\u2019s aviation system during the government shutdown.",
      "The FAA ordered domestic airlines last week to drop 4% of their flights at 40 major U.S. airports, saying absences and signs of stress among traffic controllers made it imperative to act in the name of public safety. After already canceling more than 7,900 since Friday, the goal for cutting flights is set to rise to 6% on Tuesday and again to 10% on Friday.",
      "But it was unclear exactly how many additional flights would need to be canceled Tuesday. The average cancellation rate over the last few days already exceeded the FAA\u2019s requirement, according to aviation analytics company Cirium. The FAA also expanded its flight restrictions Monday, barring business jets and many private flights from using a dozen airports already under commercial flight limits.",
      "However, controller shortages continued to lead to flight delays, including one of about five hours for arriving flights Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to staffing-related disruptions earlier in the day. The FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could delay planes departing for Phoenix, San Diego, the New York area and Houston, among other cities.",
      "Freezing weather in parts of the country on Tuesday could cause further delays and cancellations.",

      "HONG KONG -- Alice Zhang, a 29-year-old marketer in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou, has spent only roughly half what she did last year during the \u201cSingles' Day\u201d online shopping festival, switching to cheaper choices and giving up on buying new shoes after pay was cut by more than 20%.",
      "That's typical, analysts say, of the trend for the extended discount campaign that is China's equivalent to Black Friday sales, initiated by China\u2019s Alibaba in 2009 as a 1-day event on Nov. 11 -- Double 11 in Chinese parlance, and considered a symbol of unattached singles.",

      "Singles\u2019 Day spending is closely watched by observers and economists as an indicator for the wider economy. This year, the sales period began as early as Oct. 9, several days earlier than in 2024, and will finish this week.",
      "Chinese retail data provider Syntun said that as of Oct. 31, the combined gross value for this year\u2019s Singles\u2019 Day had topped 1 trillion yuan ($140 billion). In 2024, it estimated sales rose about 26% year-on-year to 1.44 trillion yuan.",
      "It remains to be seen if the appetite for spending may finally be recovering after the pandemic and a prolonged downturn in the property market.",
      "Boosting domestic demand such as consumer spending and business investment is a top priority for the ruling Communist Party.",
      "Economists and analysts say spending on big ticket items remains downbeat as value-minded shoppers focus on necessities and more affordable goods.",
      "\u201cConfidence remains quite downbeat among households,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for Greater China at ING Bank.",
      "The early launch for this year\u2019s festival partly reflects the desire of the online retailers that are its main organizers to compensate for weakness in the consumer economy, said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group.",

      "\u201cA lot of people have been complaining that the discounts (this year) are not very strong,\u201d said Yaling Jiang, an independent Chinese consumer analyst, adding that she observed a stronger sense of \u201cconsumer fatigue.\u201d",

      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Billionaire Warren Buffett warned shareholders Monday that many companies will fare better than his Berkshire Hathaway in the decades ahead because of its massive size though others might say the company's prospects will dim because \u201cFather Time\u201d is catching up with the 95-year-old icon who plans to step down as CEO in January.",
      "Buffett reflected on life and his health in a new letter to shareholders where he announced $1.3 billion in new charitable gifts to the four family foundations run by his children that \u2014 along with the Gates Foundation \u2014 have been helping steadily give away his fortune since 2006.",
      "Berkshire is known for consistently outperforming the stock market during the past 60 years under Buffett \u2014 which helped earn him legions of fans \u2014 although that has become harder to do in recent years because of the huge size of the conglomerate. Berkshire owns Geico insurance, BNSF railroad, several large utilities and a diverse assortment of manufacturing and retail businesses, including such well known brands as Dairy Queen, See's Candy and Helzberg Diamonds. But Buffett also reassured shareholders that he remains confident in his successor.",
      "Buffett promised to keep in touch with shareholders through Thanksgiving letters in the future, but he confirmed that next year Greg Abel will take over Buffett's famous yearly letter and answer all the questions at the annual meeting after he becomes CEO in January.

He said he has been fortunate to have his life saved three times by doctors who lived nearby while managing to avoid the kind of calamities that often cut life short.",
      "Buffett recounted spending several weeks in the hospital after having his appendix out as a child where he turned to fingerprinting all the nuns who were taking care of him just in case they turned to a life of crime later. Buffett previously battled prostate cancer in 2012, but that wasn't considered life threatening.",

I can\u2019t think of a CEO, a management consultant, an academic, a member of government \u2013 you name it \u2013 that I would select over Greg to handle your savings and mine,\u201d Buffett wrote.",

      "\u201cIn aggregate, Berkshire\u2019s businesses have moderately better-than-average prospects, led by a few non-correlated and sizable gems. However, a decade or two from now, there will be many companies that have done better than Berkshire; our size takes its toll,\u201d Buffett said.",

      "LONDON -- The sudden resignation of two top bosses at the BBC over the editing of a speech by U.S. President Donald Trump dealt a huge blow to the broadcaster, which is revered by some in Britain as a national treasure but derided by others as outdated and left-leaning.",
      "The century-old, publicly funded BBC faced criticism after its flagship TV news program spliced together sections of a speech Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, so that it appeared he explicitly urged supporters to march on Capitol Hill and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "The BBC chairman apologized Monday for an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d A letter from Trump\u2019s attorney threatened legal action, demanding that the broadcaster \u201cretract the false, defamatory, disparaging and inflammatory statements\u201d and compensate the president for the harm caused.",
      "Critics say the episode is just the latest example of bias at the BBC, but supporters maintain that it is one of the most trusted sources of news in the U.K. and around the world, and that the departure of its most senior executives casts a chill on public-service broadcasting.",

      "The furor unfolded days after the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper last week published details from an internal memo compiled by a former external editorial standards adviser to the BBC.",
      "The memo raised concerns over how the BBC\u2019s \u201cPanorama\u201d documentary program edited a speech by Trump.",
      "The program, which was broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. election, as Trump ran for a second term, spliced together three quotes from two sections of the speech, delivered almost an hour apart, into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "Among the parts that were cut was a segment where Trump said he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "The BBC\u2019s director general, Tim Davie, and head of news, Deborah Turness, both resigned Sunday.",
      "The broadcaster\u2019s chair, Samir Shah, acknowledged that the editing gave \u201cthe impression of a direct call for violent action.\u201d Turness said Monday that mistakes were made, but she insisted \"there\u2019s no institutional bias\u201d at the BBC \u2014 a position supported by Prime Minister Keir Starmer.",

      "Critics have long charged that the broadcaster leans left, though some have also accused it of being too cautious to challenge successive Conservative Party governments. On Monday, the hard-right leader of the Reform U.K. party, Nigel Farage, told a news conference that the BBC \u201chas been institutionally biased for decades\u201d to loud applause from supporters.",

      "Known affectionately \u2014 or mockingly \u2014 as \u201cAuntie,\u201d the BBC began in the 1920s and changed the history of television when many Britons bought a TV set specifically to watch the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953.

      "The Senate has passed legislation to reopen the government, bringing the longest shutdown in history closer to an end after a small group of Democrats struck a deal with Republicans",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate passed legislation Monday to reopen the government, bringing the longest shutdown in history closer to an end as a small group of Democrats ratified a deal with Republicans despite searing criticism from within their party.",
      "The 41-day shutdown could last a few more days as members of the House, which has been on recess since mid-September, return to Washington to vote on the legislation. President Donald Trump has signaled support for the bill, saying Monday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to be opening up our country very quickly.\u201d",
      "The final Senate vote, 60-40, broke a grueling stalemate that lasted more than six weeks as Democrats demanded that Republicans negotiate with them to extend health care tax credits that expire Jan. 1. The Republicans never did, and five moderate Democrats eventually switched their votes as federal food aid was delayed, airport delays worsened and hundreds of thousands of federal workers continued to go unpaid.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson urged lawmakers to start returning to Washington \u201cright now\" given shutdown-related travel delays, but an official notice issued after the Senate vote said the earliest the House will vote is Wednesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cIt appears our long national nightmare is finally coming to an end,\" said Johnson, who has kept the House out of session since mid-September, when the House passed a bill to continue government funding.",
      "After weeks of negotiations, A group of three former governors \u2014 New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire Sen. Maggie Hassan and Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine \u2014 agreed to vote to advance three bipartisan annual spending bills and extend the rest of government funding until late January. Republicans promised to hold a vote to extend the health care subsidies by mid-December, but there was no guarantee of success.",
      "Shaheen said Monday that \u201cthis was the option on the table\u201d after Republicans had refused to budge.",
      "\u201cWe had reached a point where I think a number of us believed that the shutdown had been very effective in raising the concern about health care,\" she said, and the promise for a future vote \u201cgives us an opportunity to continue to address that going forward.\"",
      "The legislation includes a reversal of the mass firings of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began on Oct. 1. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over.",
      "In addition to Shaheen, King and Hassan, Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, home to tens of thousands of federal workers, also voted Sunday in favor of moving forward on the agreement. Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat, Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman and Nevada Sens. Catherine Cortez Masto and Jacky Rosen also voted yes. All other Democrats, including Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, voted against it.",
      "The moderates had expected a larger number of Democrats to vote with them as 10 to 12 Democratic senators had been part of the negotiations. But in the end, only five switched their votes \u2014 the exact number that Republicans needed. King, Cortez Masto and Fetterman had already been voting to open the government since Oct. 1.",
      "Schumer, who received blowback from his party in March when he voted to keep the government open, said he could not \u201cin good faith\u201d support it after meeting with his caucus for more than two hours on Sunday.",
      "\u201cWe will not give up the fight,\u201d Schumer said, adding that Democrats have now \u201csounded the alarm\u201d on health care.",
      "Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucuses with the Democrats, said giving up the fight was a \u201chorrific mistake.\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., agreed, saying that voters who overwhelmingly supported Democrats in last week's elections were urging them to \"hold firm.\u201d",

      "The fourth day of the flight restrictions saw airlines scrap over 2,300 flights Monday and more than 1,000 flights set for takeoff Tuesday. Unpaid for more than a month, some air traffic controllers have begun calling out of work, citing stress and the need to take on second jobs.",
      "President Donald Trump took to social media on Monday to pressure controllers to \u201cget back to work, NOW!!!\u201d He called for a $10,000 bonus for those who've stayed on the job and suggested docking pay for those who haven't.",

Power.",
      "\u201cIf you think about it, there\u2019s all these aircraft that didn\u2019t fly where they were supposed to on a normal route,\u201d Taylor said, noting airlines will need to track down all their planes, figure out where each needs to be, and find pilots and cabin crew for those flights.",
      "Since Friday, airlines have canceled about 8,000 flights under orders to drop 4% of flights at 40 of the nation\u2019s busiest airports. That will rise to 6% on Tuesday and 10% by week's end, the FAA says.",
      "One in 10 flights nationwide were scratched Sunday \u2014 the fourth worst day for cancellations in almost two years, according aviation analytics firm Cirium.",
      "Controller shortages also led to five-hour delays Monday evening at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport, where wintry weather added to the disruptions earlier in the day, and the FAA warned that staffing at over a dozen towers and control centers could cause delays in cities including Philadelphia, Nashville and Atlanta.",

      "Sotheby\u2019s auction house will put the painting up for sale on Nov. 20 in New York after exhibiting it in London, Abu Dhabi, Hong Kong and Paris.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment of a lot of speculation,\u201d said Mexican art historian Helena Ch\u00e1vez Mac Gregor, a researcher at UNAM\u2019s Institute of Aesthetic Research and author of \u201cEl list\u00f3n y la bomba. El arte de Frida Kahlo.\u201d (The ribbon and the bomb. The art of Frida Kahlo).",

However, works from private collections abroad \u2014 like the painting in question, whose owner remains unrevealed \u2014 are legally eligible for international sale.",
      "\u201cThe system of declaring Mexican modern artistic heritage is very anomalous,\u201d said Mexican curator Cuauht\u00e9moc Medina, an art historian and specialist in contemporary art.",
      "\u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d was created in 1940 following Kahlo's trip to Paris, where she came into contact with the surrealists.",
      "Contrary to contemporary belief, the skull on the bed\u2019s canopy is not a Day of the Dead skeleton, but a Judas \u2014 a handmade cardboard figure. Traditionally lit with gunpowder during Easter, this effigy symbolizes purification and the triumph of good over evil, representing Judas Iscariot who betrayed Jesus.",
      "In the painting, the skeleton is detailed with firecrackers, flowers on its ribs and a smiling grimace \u2014 a detail inspired by a cardboard skeleton Kahlo actually kept in the canopy of her own bed.",

      "\u201cEl sue\u00f1o (La cama)\u201d was last exhibited in the 1990s, and after the auction, it could disappear from public view once again, a fate shared by many paintings acquired for large sums at auction.",

      "The nonprofit CreatiVets is transforming a once-abandoned church in Nashville into a 24-hour arts center for veterans and a community hub",
      "NASHVILLE -- Richard Casper shakes his head as he touches one of the boarded-up windows in the once-abandoned church he plans to transform into a new 24-hour arts center for veterans.",
      "The U.S. Marine Corps veteran and Purple Heart recipient said he was an arm\u2019s length away from military officials, including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, at Marine Barracks Washington when he learned the former church his nonprofit CreatiVets just purchased had been vandalized.",
      "The physical damage to the building and its stained glass windows saddened Casper. But what worried him more was that the church had remained empty since 2017 without damage. That vandalism came just weeks after CreatiVets bought it, suggesting that maybe he and the veterans in his program were not welcome.",
      "\u201cI almost just left,\u201d Casper said. \u201cIt put me in a weird headspace.\u201d",
      "However, Casper, 40, a CNN Heroes winner and Elevate Prize Foundation winner, needed more support for the center \u2014 \u201ca place to go when the PTSD hits.\u201d Like so many veterans, he said his PTSD, caused by seeing a close friend die on patrol in Iraq, would generally come in the middle of the night, when the only places open are bars and other spaces that can be \u201ddestructive.\u201d",
      "He figured a 24-hour center where veterans could engage in music, painting, sculpture, theater and other arts could help. It could \u201cturn all that pain into something beautiful.\u201d The artistic element factored in when Casper, who suffered a traumatic brain injury while serving in Iraq, returned home and found it hard to be in public \u2014 unless he was listening to live music.",
      "So he completed his mission that night in Washington, introducing new people to CreatiVets' work. Then, Casper returned to Nashville to practice what he has preached to hundreds of veterans since his nonprofit opened in 2013. He asked for help.",
      "And help came.",
      "Within weeks, CreatiVets\u2019 Art Director Tim Brown was teaching a roomful of volunteers how to create stained glass pieces to replace those that were vandalized. Brown said the volunteers wanted to give back to the organization, \u201cbut also because of the impact that these activities have had on them.\"",
      "Gary Sinise values that impact. The actor, musician and philanthropist had already signed on to donate $1 million through his foundation to help CreatiVets purchase the building. Sinise\u2019s involvement encouraged two other donors to help finalize the purchase.",
      "The \u201cCSI: NY\u201d star said he believed in CreatiVets\u2019 work and had already seen a similar program in his hometown of Chicago help veterans process their wartime experiences.",
      "\u201cIn the military, you\u2019re trained to do serious work to protect our country, right?\u201d Sinise said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in the infantry, you\u2019re being trained to kill. You\u2019re being trained to contain any emotion and be strong.\u201d",
      "Those skills are important when fighting the enemy, but they also take a toll, especially when veterans aren\u2019t taught how to discuss their feelings once the war is over.",
      "\u201cQuite often, our veterans don\u2019t want any help,\u201d Sinise said. \u201cBut through art \u2013 and with theater as well \u2013 acting out what they are going through can be very, very beneficial.\u201d",
      "David Booth says he is living proof of how CreatiVets can help. And the retired master sergeant, who served 20 years in the U.S. Army as a medic and a counterintelligence agent, wishes he participated in the program sooner.",
      "\u201cFor me, this was more important than the last year and a half of counseling that I\u2019ve gone through,\u201d said Booth. \u201cIt has been so therapeutic.\u201d",
      "After years of being asked, Booth, 53, finally joined CreatiVets\u2019 songwriting program in September. He traveled from his home in The Villages, Florida, to the historic Grand Ole Opry in Nashville, to meet with two successful songwriters \u2013 Brian White, who co-wrote Jason Aldean\u2019s \u201cBlame It on You,\u201d and Craig Campbell, of \u201cOutskirts of Heaven\u201d fame \u2013 to help him write a song about his life.",

      "Booth hopes \u201cWhat's Next\u201d becomes available on music streaming services so others can hear his story.

This year\u2019s collection was released Friday.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s almost like they could feel what I was feeling and put it into the lyrics,\" said Booth, after hearing the finished version. \"It was pretty surreal and pretty awesome.\u201d",
      "Sinise has seen the unexpected impact of art throughout his career. His Oscar-nominated role as wounded Vietnam veteran Lt. Dan Taylor in \u201cForrest Gump\u201d in 1994 deepened his connection to veterans. His music with the Lt. Dan Band expanded it. In 2011, he launched the Gary Sinise Foundation to broadly serve veterans, first responders and their families.",
      "\u201cI think citizens have a responsibility to take care of their defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are opportunities out there for all of us to do that and one of the ways to do it is through multiple nonprofits that are out there.\u201d",
      "Sinise immediately connected with CreatiVets\u2019 mission. When the idea came to dedicate the performance space at the new center to his late son Mac, who died last year after a long battle with cancer, Sinise saw it as \u201ca perfect synergy.\u201d",
      "\u201cMac was a great artist,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd he was a humble, kind of quiet, creative force\u2026 If Mac would have survived and not gone through what he went through, he\u2019d be one of our young leaders here at the foundation. He would be composing music and he\u2019d be helping veterans.\u201d",
      "Mac Sinise is still helping veterans, as proceeds of his album \u201cResurrection & Revival\u201d and its sequel completed after his death, are going to the Gary Sinise Foundation. And Gary Sinise said he discovered more compositions from his son that he plans to record later this year for a third album.",
      "After the new center was vandalized, Casper said he was heartbroken, but also inspired knowing part of the center was destined to become the Mac Sinise Auditorium. He decided to take pieces of the broken stained glass windows and transform them into new artwork inspired by Mac Sinise\u2019s music.",
      "\u201cI told you we\u2019re going to go above and beyond to make sure everyone knows Mac lived,\" Casper told Sinise as he handed him stained glass panes inspired by Mac Sinise\u2019s songs \u201cArctic Circles\u201d and \u201cPenguin Dance,\u201d \"not that he died, but that he lived.\u201d",
      "Sinise fought back tears as he said, \u201cMy gosh, that\u2019s beautiful.\u201d",
      "As he examined the pieces more closely, Sinise added, \u201cI\u2019m honored that we\u2019re going to have this place over there and that Mac is going to be supporting Richard and helping veterans.\"",

      "China has a new visa scheme that is creating job opportunities for foreign professionals, part of its effort to attract global talent and gain an edge in global technology",
      "HONG KONG -- Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the U.S., has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa program targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.",
      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201c(The) K-visa for China (is) an equivalent to the H-1B for the U.S.,\u201d said Srinivasagopalan, who is intrigued by China\u2019s working environment and culture after her father worked at a Chinese university a few years back. \u201cIt is a good option for people like me to work abroad.\u201d",
      "The K-visa supplements China's existing visa schemes including the R-visa for foreign professionals, but with loosened requirements, such as not requiring an applicant to have a job offer before applying.",
      "Stricter U.S. policies toward foreign students and scholars under Trump, including the raising of fees for the H-1B visa for foreign skilled workers to $100,000 for new applicants, are leading some non-American professionals and students to consider going elsewhere.",
      "\u201cStudents studying in the U.S. hoped for an (H-1B) visa, but currently this is an issue,\u201d said Bikash Kali Das, an Indian masters student of international relations at Sichuan University in China.",
      "China is striking while the iron is hot.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has made global leadership in advanced technologies a top priority, paying massive government subsidies to support research and development of areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics.",
      "\u201cBeijing perceives the tightening of immigration policies in the U.S. as an opportunity to position itself globally as welcoming foreign talent and investment more broadly,\u201d said Barbara Kelemen, associate director and head of Asia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly.",
      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",
      "The brain drain has not fully reversed.",
      "Many Chinese parents still see Western education as advanced and are eager to send their children abroad, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.",
      "Still, in recent years, a growing number of professionals including AI experts, scientists and engineers have moved to China from the U.S., including Chinese-Americans. Fei Su, a chip architect at Intel, and Ming Zhou, a leading engineer at U.S.-based software firm Altair, were among those who have taken teaching jobs in China this year.",
      "Many skilled workers in India and Southeast Asia have already expressed interest about the K-visa, said Edward Hu, a Shanghai-based immigration director at the consultancy Newland Chase.",
      "With the jobless rate for Chinese aged 16-24 excluding students at nearly 18%, the campaign to attract more foreign professionals is raising questions.",
      "\u201cThe current job market is already under fierce competition,\u201d said Zhou Xinying, a 24-year-old postgraduate student in behavioral science at eastern China's Zhejiang University.",

      "A recent commentary published by a state-backed news outlet, the Shanghai Observer, downplayed such concerns, saying that bringing in such foreign professionals will benefit the economy. As China advances in areas such as AI and cutting-edge semiconductors, there is a \u201cgap and mismatch\u201d between qualified jobseekers and the demand for skilled workers, it said.",
      "\u201cThe more complex the global environment, the more China will open its arms,\u201d it said.",

China\u2019s a great place to work in tech, if not for the difficult relationship between India and China,\u201d he said.",

      "ByHeart officials said that \u201cmore testing is needed\u201d to know whether the type of bacteria that causes botulism is present. It comes from a large family of bacteria, many of which are found naturally in the environment and don't cause illness, the company said.",

      "Travelers with upcoming travel plans can expect to see fewer flights to many major U.S. cities",
      "If you have upcoming travel plans anytime soon, you might notice fewer options on the airport's departure board.",
      "Airlines are scaling back flights at dozens of major U.S. airports to ease the pressure on air traffic controllers, who have been working unpaid and under intense strain during the ongoing government shutdown.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration says the decision is necessary to keep travelers safe. Many controllers have been putting in long hours and mandatory overtime while lawmakers are at a standstill over how to reopen the government.",
      "Major hubs like New York, Los Angeles and Chicago are among those affected, and the ripple effects could mean more cancellations, longer delays and fuller flights for travelers across the country. The cutbacks will impact hundreds if not thousands of flights daily.",

      "Multiple airports will be impacted in some metropolitan hubs, including New York, Houston, Chicago and Washington.",
      "It's hard to say. Even if the shutdown ends soon, the FAA has said it would not lift the flight restrictions until staffing at airport towers and regional air traffic centers makes it safe to do so.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to take time to work through this,\u201d said Michael Johnson, president of Ensemble Travel, an association of travel agencies in the U.S. and Canada.",

      "Airlines say they will let their customers know if their flight is called off.",
      "Still, it doesn't hurt to check your airline\u2019s app or a flight-tracking site for updates before you leave for the airport. It's better to be stuck at home or in a hotel than stranded in a terminal.",

While you're waiting, you can call or go online to connect to the airline\u2019s reservations staff.

      "Washington's local economy has taken blows from a series of actions by the Trump administration, from the layoffs of federal workers to the ongoing law enforcement intervention with the National Guard",
      "WASHINGTON -- With the combination of the longest government shutdown, the mass firings of government workers and a fresh cut in federal food aid, the Capital Area Food Bank in Washington is bracing for the swell of people who will need its help before the holiday season.",
      "The food bank, which serves 400 pantries and aid organizations in the District of Columbia, northern Virginia and two Maryland counties, is providing 8 million more meals than it had prepared to this budget year \u2014 a nearly 20% increase.",
      "The city is being hit \u201cespecially hard,\" said Radha Muthiah, the group's CEO and president, \"because of the sequence of events that has occurred over the course of this year.\"",
      "The nation's capital has been battered by a series of decisions by the Trump administration, from the layoffs of federal workers to the ongoing law enforcement intervention into the district. The added blow of the shutdown, which has furloughed workers and paused money for food assistance, is only deepening the economic toll.",
      "The latest figures from the D.C. Office of Revenue Analysis do not account for workforce changes since the shutdown that began Oct. 1. But even the September jobs report shows that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate hovers at 6%, compared with the most recent national rate of 4.3%, and has been the highest in the nation for months.",
      "The economic woes appear to be reverberating politically. Democrat Abigail Spanberger won election Tuesday as Virginia's governor after focusing her campaign message on the effects of President Donald Trump's actions on the state\u2019s economy.",
      "The shutdown's long-term impact on the regional economy will be felt long after the government reopens, experts say.",
      "Washington has the country's largest share of federal workers \u2014 about 20%, according to official figures \u2014 and roughly 150,000 federal employees call the area home. By Monday, hundreds of thousands of federal workers across the country will have missed at least two full paychecks because of the shutdown. Nationally, at least 670,000 federal employees are furloughed, while about 730,000 are working without pay, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "During the shutdown, the number of federal employees on Washington\u2019s transit system each weekday has dropped by about one-quarter compared with ridership in September. Eateries that the Restaurant Association of Greater Washington says were already dealing with thin margins from seasonal declines and the fallout from Trump\u2019s deployment of armed National Guard members on city streets are facing more challenges at a time when owners had hoped for a rebound.",
      "Tracy Hadden Loh, a fellow at Brookings Metro, a think tank, said that going without paychecks is causing significant cash flow issues for federal workers, potentially leading to defaults on mortgages and student loans. For local businesses, especially those reliant on federal workers\u2019 discretionary spending, it could exacerbate the impact during the high-sales October-December quarter.",
      "\u201cA lot of businesses rely on higher spending in Q4 in order to have a revenue positive year,\u201d Loh said.",
      "Small businesses are feeling the loss of that spending.",
      "The crowd watching Liverpool's Premier League game last weekend would have been standing room only at The Queen Vic, a bar in Northeast Washington. But that was not the case, said Ryan Gordon, co-owner of the British pub.",

      "\u201cTo the extent to which discretionary spending by D.C. area households is limited, that could push a lot of local businesses into the red,\u201d Loh said. The culmination of the shutdown, cut in SNAP benefits and layoffs are weighing heavy on households that have never sought help before, she added.",
      "Thea Price was fired from her job at the U.S. Institute of Peace in March of this year, part of the wave of layoffs meant to shrink the size of the federal government. Her husband, a government contractor, also lost his job at a museum. Since then, they have lived on savings, Medicaid and SNAP.",
      "Price, 37, recently went to a food pantry in Arlington, Virginia, for the first time recently. The shutdown halted funding for SNAP, after it took her months to get it, and the $500 payments she receives each month were set to stop. Virginia sent a partial payment but it was not enough, Price said. With her options to sustain herself and her family running out, Price is moving back to her hometown in the Seattle area.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t afford to stay in the area any longer and hope that something might pan out,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re just in a much different place than when these things started in March.\u201d",
      "At the Capital Area Food Bank in Northeast Washington, forklifts sped around in a controlled chaos, unloading trucks, moving food and preparing for a distribution set up for federal employees and contractors, and preparations are intensifying with the holiday season in mind. The organization is expecting to provide 1 million more meals this month than it had anticipated before the shutdown.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re very focused obviously on the immediacy of all of these impacts today and getting food to those who need it,\" said Muthiah, the group's director. But she cautioned there were long-term implications to the unfolding crisis, with people tapping their savings and retirement funds to get by.",

      "MIAMI -- The play is called \u201cCQ.\u201d It's not the most imaginative name; those are simply the initials of Miami Heat assistant coach Chris Quinn, who drew up a play about four years ago that head coach Erik Spoelstra has been waiting to use.",
      "That wait ended Monday.",
      "Spoelstra called the play and let Quinn run the huddle in the final time-out of the game with four-tenths of a second left in overtime, drawing up how Norman Powell would create a distraction and Davion Mitchell would set a screen and Jaime Jaquez Jr. would just hang out in the corner and Nikola Jovic would throw a lob inbounds pass and Andrew Wiggins, if all went according to plan, would have a dunk at the rim.",
      "\u201cPerfect,\u201d Jaquez Jr. said.",
      "Everything went as it should. Final score: Miami 140, Cleveland 138, capping one of the wilder games in this wild start to the NBA season.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just embracing the unknown, embracing the confidence guys are gaining in what we\u2019re doing,\" Spoelstra said. \"It always helps when you get some W\u2019s out of it, but guys understand our identity to defend and now can create some things for us offensively. Guys are growing right before our eyes.\u201d",
      "Cleveland took 120 shots in the game, the most ever by a Heat opponent and the most by any team in the NBA since Jan. 2, 2023. The Cavaliers took 65 3-pointers, also the most ever by a Miami opponent and the third-highest total in NBA history \u2014 Houston took 70 on Jan. 16, 2019 and took 68 three nights later for spots No. 1 and 2 on that list.",
      "And it wasn't enough.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a chess game. Chess match. You've got to give them credit,\" said Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell, who made a crazy 3-pointer with 0.4 seconds left in overtime \u2014 almost an afterthought because of what the Heat did next. \"They made an excellent read, an excellent call and you learn from these things. This is great this happened now. This is something that, you get to a situation later in the year and say, \u2018OK, we understand where we can adjust.\u2019 We watch the film and go from there.\u201d",
      "There were numbers Cleveland didn't like, such as the 21-4 discrepancy in free-throw attempts in the third quarter \u2014 which coach Kenny Atkinson pointed out to the officiating crew and earned an ejection in the process.",
      "\u201cWhen the disparity's that great, you've got to stick up for your guys,\u201d Atkinson said.",

      "Round 1, Game 4, Eastern Conference first-round in Miami. Cleveland embarrassed the Heat, winning 138-83 to sweep what was the most lopsided playoff series in NBA history. The Cavaliers scored exactly 138 points again on Monday \u2014 and the Heat found a way to win anyway.",
      "That series led Spoelstra to change almost everything about the way Miami plays. The offense is unrecognizable compared to what it was. The pace is super-fast compared to past years. The goal is to attack on every possession, either getting to the rim or getting a 3-pointer in the air. Cleveland forced the Heat to reassess everything.",
      "So far, that seems like a good thing for Miami.",
      "\u201cThe new offense, it's night and day,\" Wiggins said. \"We\u2019re out there, playing with a lot of joy, playing fast. Everyone\u2019s out there in great rhythm, so it\u2019s been a great start of the year.\u201d",

      "China has a new visa scheme that is creating job opportunities for foreign professionals, part of its effort to attract global talent and gain an edge in global technology",
      "HONG KONG -- Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the U.S., has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa program targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.",
      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201c(The) K-visa for China (is) an equivalent to the H-1B for the U.S.,\u201d said Srinivasagopalan, who is intrigued by China\u2019s working environment and culture after her father worked at a Chinese university a few years back. \u201cIt is a good option for people like me to work abroad.\u201d",
      "The K-visa supplements China's existing visa schemes including the R-visa for foreign professionals, but with loosened requirements, such as not requiring an applicant to have a job offer before applying.",
      "Stricter U.S. policies toward foreign students and scholars under Trump, including the raising of fees for the H-1B visa for foreign skilled workers to $100,000 for new applicants, are leading some non-American professionals and students to consider going elsewhere.",
      "\u201cStudents studying in the U.S. hoped for an (H-1B) visa, but currently this is an issue,\u201d said Bikash Kali Das, an Indian masters student of international relations at Sichuan University in China.",
      "China is striking while the iron is hot.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has made global leadership in advanced technologies a top priority, paying massive government subsidies to support research and development of areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics.",
      "\u201cBeijing perceives the tightening of immigration policies in the U.S. as an opportunity to position itself globally as welcoming foreign talent and investment more broadly,\u201d said Barbara Kelemen, associate director and head of Asia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly.",
      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",
      "The brain drain has not fully reversed.",
      "Many Chinese parents still see Western education as advanced and are eager to send their children abroad, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.",
      "Still, in recent years, a growing number of professionals including AI experts, scientists and engineers have moved to China from the U.S., including Chinese-Americans. Fei Su, a chip architect at Intel, and Ming Zhou, a leading engineer at U.S.-based software firm Altair, were among those who have taken teaching jobs in China this year.",
      "Many skilled workers in India and Southeast Asia have already expressed interest about the K-visa, said Edward Hu, a Shanghai-based immigration director at the consultancy Newland Chase.",
      "With the jobless rate for Chinese aged 16-24 excluding students at nearly 18%, the campaign to attract more foreign professionals is raising questions.",

      "Earth's warming climate has gotten nastier faster than society has been able to wean itself from burning the coal, oil and natural gas that emits carbon pollution that triggers global warming, several scientists and officials said.",
      "There's been progress \u2014 more than a degree Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) has been shaved off future warming projections since 2015 \u2014 but the lack of enough of it will be a big focus for the next two weeks as diplomats gather in Belem, Brazil, for annual United Nations climate negotiations.",
      "\u201cI think it's important that we're honest with the world and we declare failure,\u201d said Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany. He said warming's harms are happening faster and more severely than scientists predicted.",
      "But diplomats aren't giving up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re actually in the direction that we established in Paris at a speed that none of us could have predicted,\u201d said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd that agreement, which requires countries to come up with plans to fight warming.",
      "But the speed of humanity's climate-fighting effort is slower than the acceleration of climate's harms, she said, adding that means that \"the gap between the progress that we see on the ground and where we ought to be, that gap is still there and widening.\u201d",
      "U.N. Environment Programme Executive Director Inger Andersen said that the world is \u201cobviously falling behind.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe're sort of sawing the branch on which we are sitting,\u201d she said.",
      "The planet's annual temperature jumped about 0.46 degrees Celsius (0.83 degrees Fahrenheit) since 2015, one of the biggest 10-year temperature hikes on record, according to data from the European climate service Copernicus. This year will be either the second or third hottest on record, Copernicus calculated. Each year since 2015 has been hotter than the year of the Paris climate deal.",
      "Deadly heat waves have struck not just traditional hot spots like India and the Middle East, but even in more temperate places such as the Pacific Northwest in North America and Russia's Siberia.",
      "Earth has been hit repeatedly with more costly, dangerous and extreme weather. The decade since 2015 has seen the most Category 5 Atlantic hurricanes and the most billion-dollar weather disasters in the United States, according to records kept by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. America has been hit by 193 disasters that cost at least $1 billion in the past 10 years for a total bill of $1.5 trillion.",
      "Wildfires have consumed parts of Hawaii, California, Europe and Australia. Floods have devastated parts of Pakistan,China and the American South. And many of those, but not all, have had the fingerprints of human-caused climate change, scientists have calculated.",
      "Since 2015, more than 7 trillion tons of ice in the world's glaciers and ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica have disappeared, ice scientists calculate. That's the equivalent of more than 19 million Empire State Buildings.",
      "Sea level rise is accelerating. In the past decade, the world's seas have gone up 40 millimeters (1.6 inches). It may not sound like much, but it's enough water to fill 30 lakes the size of Lake Erie, according to Steve Nerem, a University of Colorado professor who researches sea level rise.",
      "Even the Amazon, where the climate negotiations will convene, has gone from a planet-saving region that sucks heat-trapping gases out of the air to a region that, because of deforestation, at times is spewing them.",

Last year, 74% of the growth in electricity generated worldwide was from wind, solar and other green choices, according to two July U.N. reports. In 2015, a half-million electric vehicles were sold globally, and last year it was 17 million, the report said.",
      "\u201cThere's no stopping it,\u201d said former U.S. Special Climate Envoy Todd Stern, who helped negotiate the Paris Agreement. \u201cYou cannot hold back the tides.\u201d",
      "In 2015, U.N. projections figured that Earth was on path for almost 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since the mid-1800s. Now, the world is on track to warm 2.8 degrees (5 degrees Fahrenheit), maybe a little less if countries do as they promise.",
      "But that's nowhere near the goal of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), a level that scientific reports say is more or less the danger line and which became the Paris Agreement's overarching goal.",
      "\u201cTen years ago we had a more orderly pathway for staying away from 1.5 degrees C entirely,\" Rockstrom said. \"Now we are 10 years later. We have failed.\u201d",
      "A report examining dozens of indicators of progress \u2014 such as solar and wind power installations \u2014 in transitioning from a fossil fuel economy found that none were on pace for keeping warming at or below the 1.5 degree goal.",
      "The report by the Bezos Earth Fund, Climate Analytics, the Climate High-Level Champions, ClimateWorks Foundation and World Resources Institute found that 35 of them are at least going in the right direction, although far too slowly.",
      "\u201cTechnologies, once hypothetical, are now becoming a reality. And the good news is that reality has outpaced many of the projections a decade ago,\" said report author Kelly Levin, science and data chief at the Bezos Earth Fund. \"But it\u2019s not nearly fast enough for what\u2019s needed.\u201d",
      "Methane levels in the atmosphere increased 5.2% from 2015 to 2024, while carbon dioxide levels jumped 5.8% in the same time, according to NOAA data.",
      "Several developing countries, including the United States and the rest of the developed world, have reduced their carbon dioxide emissions by about 7% since 2015, but other countries have seen their emissions soar, with China's going up 15.5% and India's soaring 26.7%, according to data from the Global Carbon Project.",
      "Oxfam International looked at global emissions by income level and found that the richest 0.1% of people increased their carbon emissions by 3% since 2015. Meanwhile, the poorest 10% of people reduced their emissions by 30%.",
      "\u201cThe Paris Agreement itself has underperformed,\u201d said climate negotiations historian Joanna Depledge of the University of Cambridge in England. \u201cUnfortunately, it is one of those half-full, half-empty situations where you can\u2019t say it\u2019s failed. But then nor can you say it\u2019s dramatically succeeded.\u201d",

      "A power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, is impacting global auto production",
      "A battle for control of a little-known chipmaker has threatened global auto production by choking off the semiconductor supply chain, though there are signs the crisis is inching toward a resolution.",
      "The power struggle over Nexperia, a Chinese-owned Dutch semiconductor maker, highlights how technology supply chain vulnerabilities are squeezing auto makers, most notably forcing Honda to halt production at a Mexican factory making its popular HR-V crossover for North American markets. It also exposes how Europe is caught in the middle of the wider geopolitical showdown between Washington and Beijing.",
      "Here's a look at the dispute:",
      "The turmoil erupted into public view in mid-October, when the Dutch government announced it had invoked a rarely used World War II-era law to take effective control of Nexperia weeks earlier.",
      "The Dutch ministry of economic affairs said it took action because of national security concerns. Officials said they intervened because of \u201cserious governance shortcomings\u201d at Nexperia, asserting control to prevent the loss of crucial tech know-how that could threaten Europe's economic security.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s Chinese owner Wingtech Technology, a partially state-owned company, is at the heart of the dispute. Amid the boardroom battle, a Dutch court granted the ministry's request to oust Nexperia's Chinese CEO Zhang Xuezheng. American officials told the Dutch government he would have to be replaced to avoid trade restrictions, according to a court filing.",
      "Nexperia makes simple semiconductors such as switches and logic chips. The auto industry \u2014 one of Nexperia's biggest markets \u2014 uses its chips for numerous functions, such as adaptive LED headlight controllers, electric vehicle battery management systems and anti-lock brakes.",
      "Headquartered in the Dutch city of Nijmegen, Nexperia was spun off from Philips Semiconductors two decades ago. It was eventually purchased by China's Wingtech Technology in 2018 for $3.6 billion.",
      "Nexperia has wafer fabrication plants in Britain and Germany. It operates an assembly and testing center in China's southern manufacturing heartland of Guangdong \u2014 which accounts for around 70% of its end-product capacity \u2014 and similar centers in the Philippines and Malaysia.",
      "The dispute is part of the broader struggle between the U.S. and China over tech supremacy, which has left Europe caught in the middle.",
      "It stems from Washington\u2019s decision late last year to place Wingtech on its \u201centity list,\" which subjects companies to export controls because of national security risks. In late September, the U.S. expanded that list to Wingtech\u2019s subsidiaries, including Nexperia, pressuring allies to follow suit.",
      "After the Dutch government asserted control of Nexperia, Beijing responded soon after, blocking the export of Nexperia chips from its assembly plant in the Chinese city of Dongguan. It blamed the Netherlands for \u201cturmoil and chaos\u201d in the chip supply chain.",
      "There were signs of hope following last month's high-profile meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping, when the White House said Beijing would ease the export ban as part of a U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Despite Beijing also confirming exports would be allowed to resume, Nexperia\u2019s Chinese unit said headquarters suspended shipments of wafers used to make chips to its Chinese factory, potentially crimping its ability to deliver finished products.",
      "Nexperia\u2019s head office hit back in a statement Wednesday, saying the Chinese unit refused to pay for the wafers and accused it of \u201cignoring the lawful instructions\" from its global management team. The company said it can\u2019t guarantee the quality of any chips delivered from its China plant since Oct. 13.",
      "Modern automobiles rely on so-called discrete chips made by companies like Nexperia, which, unlike more advanced microprocessors, perform a single function. Leaders at big carmakers spelled out their worries in the latest round of earnings calls, saying that finding a replacement for Nexperia at scale in the short term will be difficult.",

      "Don't lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure",
      "WASHINGTON -- Don\u2019t lose sleep over headlines linking melatonin to heart failure.",
      "That\u2019s the message after some scary-sounding reports about a preliminary study involving the sleep-related supplement. It raised questions about the safety of long term use of melatonin for insomnia.",
      "Doctors have long known that too little or interrupted sleep raises the risk of heart disease. But heart experts say this kind of so-called observational study can't prove that melatonin use plays any role \u2014 instead of the insomnia patients were trying to treat.",
      "\u201cWe should not raise the alarm and tell patients to stop taking all their melatonin,\u201d said Dr. Pratik Sandesara, an interventional cardiologist at Emory Healthcare who wasn\u2019t involved with the research.",
      "Our bodies naturally produce melatonin, a hormone that regulates our sleep cycles. Levels normally increase as it gets darker in the evening, triggering drowsiness.",
      "People may take lab-produced melatonin to help them fall asleep or to adjust for jet lag or time changes.",
      "The new study used international electronic health records, tracking adults diagnosed with insomnia who had a melatonin prescription that suggested they used the supplement for at least a year.",
      "Over five years, 4.6% of the chronic melatonin users developed heart failure compared to 2.7% of insomnia patients whose charts showed no melatonin use, the researchers found. The study is being presented at an American Heart Association meeting but hasn\u2019t undergone peer review.",
      "But only certain countries require a melatonin prescription. It\u2019s over-the-counter in the U.S., meaning Americans in the study might have used the supplements without it being recorded, said Northwestern University cardiology chief Dr. Clyde Yancy, who wasn't involved in the study. The study also did not show dosages.",
      "Also, U.S. supplements don\u2019t require government approval, meaning brands can vary in their ingredients. The researchers, from SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, characterized the findings as a call for more research.",

      "James Watson, the scientist who co-discovered the structure of DNA, died on Nov. 6, 2025, at the age of 97",
      "On a foggy Saturday morning in 1953, a tall, skinny 24-year-old man fiddled with shapes he had cut out of cardboard. They represented fragments of a DNA molecule, and young James Watson was trying to figure how they fit together in a way that let DNA do its job as the stuff of genes.",
      "Suddenly, he realized that they joined together to form the \u201crungs\u201d of a long, twisted ladder, a shape better known nowadays as a double helix.",
      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "But it was more than that. Discovering the structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, was a breakthrough that would help open the way to a revolution in medicine, biology and other fields as diverse as crime-fighting, genealogy and ethics.",
      "Watson died Thursday, according to his former research lab. The Chicago-born scientist was 97 years old. His career was marked by significant achievements, including his role in mapping the human genome. However, his legacy is complicated by controversial remarks on race, which led to his condemnation and loss of honorary titles.",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Bruce Stillman, president of the Cold Spring Harbor lab, on Friday.",
      "Watson shared the Nobel Prize with collaborator Francis Crick and scientist Maurice Wilkins. They were aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in his book \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked.",
      "Both of his Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004. Franklin died in 1958.",
      "Their discovery instantly suggested how hereditary information is stored and how a cell duplicates its DNA before dividing so that each resulting cell inherits a copy. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper.",
      "\u201cFrancis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\u201d Watson once said. He also wrote: \u201cThere was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\u201d",
      "Among non-scientists, the double helix has become an instantly recognized symbol of science. And for researchers, it helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees.",
      "That in turn has raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering a person\u2019s genome in a way that is transmitted to one\u2019s offspring.",
      "Watson\u2019s initial motivation for supporting the gene project was personal: His son Rufus had been hospitalized with a possible diagnosis of schizophrenia, and Watson figured that knowing the complete makeup of DNA would be crucial for understanding that disease, maybe in time to help his son.",
      "Watson never made another lab finding as big as the double helix. But in the decades that followed, he wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, picked out bright young scientists and helped them. And he used his prestige and contacts to influence science policy.",

      "\u201cA goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid,\u201d he wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery.",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \u201cYou have to avoid dumb people. ... Never do anything that bores you. ... If you can\u2019t stand to be with your real peers (including scientific competitors) get out of science. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\u201d",
      "It was in the fall of 1951 that the tall, skinny Watson \u2014 already the holder of a Ph.D. at 23 \u2014 arrived at Britain\u2019s Cambridge University, where he met Crick. As a Watson biographer later said, \u201cIt was intellectual love at first sight.\u201d",
      "Crick himself wrote that the partnership thrived in part because the two men shared \u201ca certain youthful arrogance, a ruthlessness, and an impatience with sloppy thinking.\u201d",
      "Together they sought to tackle the structure of DNA, aided by X-ray research by colleague Rosalind Franklin and her graduate student Raymond Gosling. Watson was later criticized for a disparaging portrayal of Franklin in \u201cThe Double Helix,\u201d and today she is considered a prominent example of a female scientist whose contributions were overlooked. (She died in 1958.)",
      "Watson and Crick built Tinker Toy-like models to work out the molecule\u2019s structure. One Saturday morning in 1953, after fiddling with bits of cardboard he had carefully cut to represent fragments of the DNA molecule, Watson suddenly realized how these pieces could form the \u201crungs\u201d of a double helix ladder.",

      "His first reaction: \u201cIt\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d",
      "Figuring out the double helix \u201cgoes down as one of the three most important discoveries in the history of biology,\u201d alongside Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution through natural selection and Gregor Mendel\u2019s fundamental laws of genetics, said Cold Spring Harbor lab's president, Bruce Stillman.",
      "Following the discovery, Watson spent two years at the California Institute of Technology, then joined the faculty at Harvard in 1955. Before leaving Harvard in 1976, he essentially created the university\u2019s program for molecular biology, scientist Mark Ptashne recalled in a 1999 interview.",
      "Watson became director of the Cold Spring Harbor lab in 1968, its president in 1994 and its chancellor 10 years later. He made the lab on Long Island an educational center for scientists and non-scientists, focused research on cancer, instilled a sense of excitement and raised huge amounts of money.",
      "He transformed the lab into a \u201cvibrant, incredibly important center,\u201d Ptashne said. It was \u201cone of the miracles of Jim: a more disheveled, less smooth, less typically ingratiating person you could hardly imagine.\u201d",
      "From 1988 to 1992, Watson directed the federal effort to identify the detailed makeup of human DNA. He created the project\u2019s huge investment in ethics research by simply announcing it at a news conference. He later said it was \u201cprobably the wisest thing I\u2019ve done over the past decade.\u201d",
      "Watson was on hand at the White House in 2000 for the announcement that the federal project had completed an important goal: a \u201cworking draft\u201d of the human genome, basically a road map to an estimated 90 percent of human genes.",
      "Researchers presented Watson with the detailed description of his own genome in 2007. It was one of the first genomes of an individual to be deciphered.",
      "Watson knew that genetic research could produce findings that make some people uncomfortable. In 2007, he wrote that when scientists identify genetic variants that predispose people to crime or significantly affect intelligence, the findings should be publicized rather than squelched out of political correctness.",
      "James Dewey Watson was born in Chicago on April 6, 1928, into \u201ca family that believed in books, birds and the Democratic Party,\u201d as he put it. From his birdwatcher father he inherited an interest in ornithology and a distaste for explanations that didn\u2019t rely on reason or science.",
      "Watson was a precocious child who loved to read, studying books like \u201cThe World Telegraph Almanac of Facts.\u201d He entered the University of Chicago on a scholarship at 15, graduated at 19 and earned his doctorate in zoology at Indiana University three years later.",
      "He got interested in genetics at age 17 when he read a book that said genes were the essence of life.",
      "\u201cI thought, \u2018Well, if the gene is the essence of life, I want to know more about it,\u2019\u201d he later recalled. \u201cAnd that was fateful because, otherwise, I would have spent my life studying birds and no one would have heard of me.\u201d",
      "At the time, it wasn\u2019t clear that genes were made of DNA, at least for any life form other than bacteria. But Watson went to Europe to study the biochemistry of nucleic acids like DNA. At a conference in Italy, Watson saw an X-ray image that indicated DNA could form crystals.",
      "\u201cSuddenly I was excited about chemistry,\u201d Watson wrote in \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d If genes could crystallize, \u201cthey must have a regular structure that could be solved in a straightforward fashion.\u201d",
      "\u201cA potential key to the secret of life was impossible to push out of my mind,\u201d he recalled.",
      "In the decades after his discovery, Watson\u2019s fame persisted. Apple Computer used his picture in an ad campaign. At conferences, graduate students who weren\u2019t even born when he worked at Cambridge nudged each other and whispered, \u201cThere\u2019s Watson. There\u2019s Watson.\u201d They got him to autograph napkins or copies of \u201cThe Double Helix.\u201d",
      "A reporter asked him 2018 if any building at the Cold Spring Harbor lab was named after him. No, Watson replied, \u201cI don\u2019t need a building named after me. I have the double helix.\u201d",
      "His 2007 remarks on race were not the first time Watson struck a nerve with his comments. In a speech in 2000, he suggested that sex drive is related to skin color. And earlier he told a newspaper that if a gene governing sexuality were found and could be detected in the womb, a woman who didn\u2019t want to have a gay child should be allowed to have an abortion.",
      "More than a half-century after winning the Nobel, Watson put the gold medal up for auction in 2014. The winning bid, $4.7 million, set a record for a Nobel. The medal was eventually returned to Watson.",
      "Both of Watson\u2019s Nobel co-winners, Crick and Wilkins, died in 2004.",

In her review, Jocelyn Noveck writes, \u201cThe chief weakness of \u2018Freakier Friday\u2019 \u2014 an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

She worries about a whole community of West Virginia coal miners \u2014 including a growing number in their 30s and 40s \u2014 who come to her for help while getting sicker and sicker from what used to be considered an old-timer\u2019s disease: black lung.",
      "\u201cI love these guys,\u201d she said, wiping tears. \u201cI tell them \u2026 \u2018Every single one of y\u2019all that sits down in that chair is why I feel like I was put on this earth.\u2019\u201d",
      "As director of the New River Health Association Black Lung Clinic, Emery\u2019s seen guys as young as 45 getting double lung transplants as disease rates soar among miners forced to dig through more rock filled with deadly silica to reach the remaining coal \u2014 far worse than the dust their grandfathers inhaled. A rule approved last year by the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration would cut the federal limit for allowable respirable crystalline silica dust exposure by half to help protect miners of all types nationwide from the current driving force of black lung and other illnesses.",
      "But, now, it\u2019s in jeopardy amid other Trump administration cutbacks and proposals targeting workers\u2019 health and safety guardrails: Stuck in a politically charged environment that promotes industry, with lawmakers arguing to change it and the federal agency that wrote the rule not pushing to enforce it. Some angry retired miners with black lung are fighting back, demanding that President Donald Trump honor promises he made to the people who voted him in.",
      "The opposition comes months after Trump signed executive orders to allow coal-fired plants to pollute more and to streamline the permitting process and open up new areas for mineral production, including oil and natural gas drilling and mining of \u201cbeautiful, clean coal.\u201d He was celebrated at the White House by smiling miners in hard hats, including some with West Virginia stickers, as he promised to put more people to work underground.",
      "\u201cOne thing I learned about the coal miners: That\u2019s what they want to do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, and they\u2019d be unhappy. They want to mine coal.\u201d",
      "But since his inauguration in January, a volley of firings, department eliminations and proposed regulation rollbacks have targeted hard-won health and safety protections fought for over decades to safeguard coal miners and other working-class folks.",
      "The silica rule was delayed in April after industry groups suing the government filed an emergency request in court to block it from taking effect, citing costs and difficulties implementing it. Around the same time, the Trump administration told nearly all employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health that their jobs were being cut. That included those running a congressionally mandated surveillance program that certifies black lung cases.",
      "Loud public uproar and bipartisan criticism followed, and a fraction of the agency\u2019s positions were reinstated. That came only after a West Virginia coal miner diagnosed with black lung sued. A federal judge in that case issued a preliminary injunction ordering the government to bring back respiratory health division workers at NIOSH.",
      "But some jobs, including those focused on mine safety and research, have not been restored. And even employees who have been recalled say a lack of funding and loss of expertise in specialized positions, from chemists to engineers, have made it impossible for them to operate at the same level as before.",
      "In addition, the Labor Department has proposed altering some mining regulations to weaken the authority of district mine health and safety managers that could impact ventilation, roof prevention and training programs.",
      "The result of all these changes is that many blue-collar workers and first responders nationwide \u2014 from commercial fishermen and miners to firefighters and construction workers \u2014 will have fewer people working to help keep them safe and healthy while doing some of the country\u2019s most dangerous jobs, many of them deep in Trump country.",
      "In fact, the two reddest states in America \u2014 Wyoming and West Virginia \u2014 had the highest overall worker death rates in 2023, according to the latest government figures. Together they experienced more than a dozen fatalities in the mining, quarrying and oil and gas sector that year.",
      "As a United Steelworkers union leader representing about 700 trona miners in Wyoming, Marshal Cummings worries the little-known white powdery rock he digs \u2014 used in everything from glass and detergents to paper \u2014 could be making workers sick. He helped push for the silica rule to cover miners like him, offering them the same free health screenings as coal miners, and was forced to wait for researchers from NIOSH to investigate air quality at his site after a request he filed was initially killed by the layoffs.",
      "\u201cWe got promised that we were going to make America great again, make America healthy again,\u201d Cummings said at the time.",
      "\u201cYou should be making these cuts with the scalpel,\u201d he added. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be using a chainsaw and chunking out all these things because you\u2019re impacting workers.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the country, Emery sits in her office off a busy highway nestled amid West Virginia\u2019s breathtaking mountains and whitewater rivers that attract tourists from across the world. Data collected from her clinic along with more than two dozen others nationwide, spell out what she sees in real time every day: Of the 11,500 coal miners from central Appalachia with X-rays analyzed by NIOSH-certified readers from mid-2020 through mid-2025, 55% had some form of black lung with the highest annual rate \u2014 62% \u2014 recorded among miners seen in the past year, according to researcher Kirsten Almberg at the University of Illinois Chicago. That compares to 41% elsewhere in the U.S. over the same five-year period.",
      "Experts say that\u2019s because much of the easy-to-reach coal has already been extracted in West Virginia and neighboring Virginia and Kentucky, forcing miners to use massive equipment to eat through walls of quartz-filled sandstone to reach the remaining thin coal seams. This creates excess dust laced with shards of silica, which also cause lung cancer and kidney disease. It\u2019s 20 times more toxic than coal dust, the major culprit of the past that often sickened older workers. The silica crystals embed in miners\u2019 lungs, causing chronic inflammation and eventually irreversible scarring that peppers X-rays with chalky spots. It leaves proud, once-strong men skinny and weak. They choke on their food and gasp after just a few steps, cradling shiny cylinders that provide a lifeline of oxygen through tubes snaking into their nostrils.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019ve ever about drowned \u2014 or anybody\u2019s about drowned \u2014 they know what I\u2019m talking about because I go through that every morning,\u201d said Mark F. Powell, a fourth-generation miner from southern West Virginia who\u2019s upset with Trump\u2019s policies. \u201cBy the end of the day, I\u2019m so tired. Sometimes I don\u2019t even eat supper. I\u2019ll come home and sometimes I\u2019m not even able to take a shower. I\u2019m not ashamed to tell it. I\u2019ll lay on the floor and go to sleep.\u201d",
      "He said he wore his protective respirator throughout his nearly 30-year career, but was still diagnosed with a progressive form of complicated black lung and silicosis when he was 45. NIOSH certified his X-ray, allowing him to move to a job on the surface with no pay cut. Now, just four years later, he said he doesn\u2019t have the wind to mow his lawn.",
      "He said he worries about younger miners. Some, no longer protected by unions, were afraid to speak to The Associated Press or question bosses who may be skirting health and safety regulations.",
      "From 1970 to 2016, more than 75,000 miners\u2019 deaths were connected to black lung, according to NIOSH. Disease rates dropped after Congress put the agency\u2019s Coal Workers\u2019 Health Surveillance Program in place, but have surged since the late 1990s. NIOSH and unions have highlighted the need for the silica rule for decades, which cuts permissible silica dust levels inside mines from 100 to 50 micrograms per cubic meter of air averaged over an eight-hour shift \u2014 the same levels already enforced by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in other industries such as construction. In 2018, NIOSH published a report showing around one in five coal miners with at least 25 years\u2019 experience in central Appalachia had black lung. Those findings were based largely off of working miners who may not have been sick when X-rayed. Researchers say the newer numbers collected from black lung clinics like Emery\u2019s show a bleaker picture because they capture miners who are disabled or retired, many of whom were never screened by NIOSH.",
      "In July, seven House Republicans, led by Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, who chairs the House Education and Workforce committee, wrote a letter to the Mine Safety and Health Administration opposing parts of the silica rule, saying it ignored commonsense controls such as job rotation and personal protective equipment. The letter did not mention black lung or other diseases caused by silica dust, but said the rule was an example of Biden administration red tape and \u201cimposed hundreds of millions of dollars in costs\u201d on the mining industry.",
      "Walberg did not respond to questions from AP, but a committee spokesperson said in a statement that while the Republicans support ensuring miner safety, the current silica rule does not provide mine operators enough flexibility to apply the standards in an economically feasible way.",
      "The White House and the Labor Department insisted the administration can maintain miners\u2019 health and safety while rolling back regulations.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump cares about our miners more than any other president in modern history \u2013 which is why he has implemented his energy dominance agenda to protect their jobs and revive the mining industry,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers.",
      "But sick miners say the cost, for them, is their lives. Even after removing all exposure to silica and coal dust, symptoms continue to worsen, typically resulting in only two options: A risky, expensive lung transplant or death.",
      "\u201cI feel like in our part of the country \u2026 we\u2019re kinda forgotten about,\u201d said John Robinson, a former miner from Nickelsville, Virginia, who uses a walking stick and oxygen after being diagnosed with the disease 12 years ago at age 47. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right.\u201d",
      "Emery said her youngest patient with the most complicated form of black lung, called progressive massive fibrosis, was just 31 when he was diagnosed after only 10 years underground. And he\u2019s not alone: Rates in the region have jumped in recent years \u2014 hitting an all-time high for long-tenured miners in the mid-2000s, according to NIOSH data.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing at the black lung clinics is just really alarming,\u201d she said. \u201cSo truly, if the rule got put in place today, cutting the silica exposure level in half, you already have sick miners. It\u2019s going to take a solid 15 to 20 years for us to start to see this taper off.\u201d",
      "The history of disease and sacrifice is everywhere in these mountains. Just a few miles from Emery\u2019s office, silica created one of the worst occupational disasters in U.S. history when more than 750 miners \u2014 most of them Black \u2014 died from breathing the toxic dust while drilling the Hawks Nest tunnel in the early 1930s to divert water to power a metal plant. A small cemetery with rows of sunken, unmarked graves memorializes the tragedy in an area where rumbling coal trains and steep mining tipples remain the backdrop in tired rural towns blighted by unemployment and decaying houses.",

      "Joe Megna was just a teenager when his dad left for the No. 9 mine in Farmington on the day he was set to retire in November 1968.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018This is your last shift, don\u2019t go to work, we\u2019ll go trout fishing,\u2019\u201d Megna said, recalling his dad\u2019s dutiful response to the company. \u201cHe said: \u2018I owe them that much.\u2019\u201d",
      "Megna said his father then told him he loved him \u2014 for the first time \u2014 and drove off.",
      "\u201cThis was the last time we talked,\u201d he said.",
      "Early the next morning, the ground shook so hard, it was felt miles away. Roaring plumes of smoke billowed more than 100 feet into the sky from a raging fire. Megna\u2019s dad was among 78 miners who did not escape the explosion. His body remains entombed there along with 18 other men who were sealed inside.",
      "It was the first mining disaster broadcast on national television, shocking the public and enraging workers. A few months later, roughly 40,000 West Virginia coal miners walked off the job in an unauthorized wildcat strike, demanding better black lung protections and benefits when the state was a Democratic stronghold. Congress responded by passing the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969, which required government oversight and enforcement at coal mines and established breathable dust standards \u2014 the same ones the 2024 silica rule would cut in half \u2014 and compensation for miners disabled by black lung.",
      "The federal black lung surveillance program was created as part of that act, which also helped lay the framework for broader workplace safety legislation a year later that formed OSHA and NIOSH as agencies. While OSHA is charged with enforcing worker health and safety standards under the Department of Labor, including citing employers for violations, NIOSH is the quiet research and development arm. It focuses on making recommendations to avoid work-related illness and injury and is overseen by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "NIOSH investigates and studies firefighter deaths, including cancers. It certifies N95 masks and reviews and verifies illnesses involving 9/11 first responders who could be eligible for benefits under the federal World Trade Center Health Program. Scientists in its Spokane, Washington, laboratory \u2014 which remains gutted \u2014 work to keep wildland firefighters, oil and gas workers and commercial fishermen safe. Some were also helping to develop real-time monitors to alert miners of silica dust overexposure.",
      "The chaotic layoffs in April and May were made in the name of redundancy when Elon Musk was at the helm of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, but no other agency does what NIOSH does. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., admitted during a congressional budget hearing in May that \u201cwe made a couple of mistakes\u201d while saying he restored 328 jobs at NIOSH, mostly in Cincinnati and Morgantown, West Virginia.",
      "\u201cUnder Secretary Kennedy\u2019s leadership, the nation\u2019s critical public health functions remain intact and effective,\u201d a Health and Human Services Department spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to protecting essential services like those that support coal miners through NIOSH.\u201d",
      "Unions estimate around 500 employees remain on administrative leave while their future is hashed out in court after lawsuits were filed to have the jobs reinstated. Others took buyouts or have accepted positions elsewhere. The Trump administration has attacked federal employee unions, including those representing the agency, attempting to strip collective bargaining rights. That too has prompted lawsuits.",
      "NIOSH was slated to become part of the newly planned Administration for a Healthy America, and Kennedy proposed its budget for fiscal year 2026 be slashed to $73 million \u2014 an 80% decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, in September, the Trump administration provided $625 million in funding to expand and improve coal-powered plants.",
      "Prior to the government shutdown, the House and Senate appropriations committees recommended the agency\u2019s funding either be slightly reduced or maintained near pre-Trump levels. Experts have argued NIOSH is a bargain, costing about $2.20 per working American annually. In 2023, the nonprofit National Safety Council found workplace injuries alone amount to about $177 billion each year.",
      "\u201cWe like to say that NIOSH is the little agency that no one\u2019s heard of that\u2019s probably helped save your life,\u201d said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, an industrial hygienist at the agency\u2019s Cincinnati offices, who spoke as vice president of the AFGE Local 3840 union. \u201cEvery single workplace safety and health regulation is written in blood.\u201d",
      "The fight has not died for some aging former West Virginia coal miners with black lung who meet regularly in a building adjacent to Emery\u2019s clinic in Oak Hill. Last month, dozens of them drove hours along with counterparts from elsewhere in Appalachia to protest on the steps of the shuttered Labor Department, some pushing walkers and stopping to catch their breath every few steps. They held up photographs of dead friends and loved ones with signs reading \u201cCoal Miners Lives Matter.\u201d",
      "On the opposite side of the building, an enormous banner with Trump\u2019s face read: \u201cAmerican Workers First.\u201d",
      "Former miner and coal truck driver Randy Lawrence said both Trump and Kennedy should do an eight-hour shift underground to see why NIOSH and the silica rule are essential. He said he hopes to send a loud message to the president he voted for, but no longer supports.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re doing everything they can to hurt the working man,\u201d he said, lugging his oxygen tank. \u201cThey ain\u2019t worried about the miners or people in West Virginia or coal miners anywhere. All they\u2019re worried about is the almighty dollar in D.C. They don\u2019t care about the little people that put them there.\u201d",
      "Outgoing United Mine Workers of America union president Cecil Roberts went a step further, accusing those delaying the silica rule of holding a pillow over miners\u2019 faces, suffocating workers. The UMWA has tried to intervene in the silica rule lawsuit to help push for its enforcement, but government lawyers have opposed it.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s stop the killing in Appalachia!\u201d he yelled into the crowd. \u201cThis country owes coal miners so much. \u2026 We allowed those fat-ass people up on Wall Street to be millionaires and billionaires. It\u2019s our turn!\u201d",
      "The silica rule lawsuit is backed by a number of industry groups that represent different types of mining nationwide.",
      "\u201cWe are absolutely supportive of the new lower levels,\u201d said Ashley Burke, a spokeswoman at the National Mining Association, which is part of the lawsuit. She said the problem is instead with how the new rule is regulated.",
      "Industry wants it to match more closely with OSHA\u2019s methods of compliance, including allowing personal protective equipment to be used more to help meet the standards. But the mining rule calls for company ventilation systems and dust suppression devices to be used as part of the primary means of control.",
      "Miners say respirators clog up frequently, making it hard to breathe, and they often slip or don\u2019t seal properly due to beards, sweat or coal dust. They can also make it difficult for them to hear, see or talk in the noisy environment underground.",
      "Retired miners who attended the rally say they also are pushing to make sure the Mine Safety and Health Administration isn\u2019t weakened. Wayne Palmer was recently confirmed to lead the agency, which has seen a dwindling number of inspectors. Palmer previously worked as an executive for an industrial minerals trade association that filed a legal brief opposing the silica rule. Protest organizers say they asked to meet with Palmer, but never got a reply. The Labor Department did not respond to specific questions about the silica rule or whether Palmer planned to address the group.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s like having a fox in a chicken house,\u201d said Gary Hairston, 71, president of the National Black Lung Association, who came out of the mines in southern West Virginia sick at 48 years old. He said coal companies cannot be trusted to police themselves, adding he used to put tape over his air monitor to make sure he didn\u2019t get bad samples because he feared being fired. He said the company also alerted miners when inspectors arrived to make sure all the safety violations were hidden. \u201cYou ain\u2019t got nobody to go to.\u201d",
      "The Mine Safety and Health Administration houses inspectors who would be responsible for enforcing the silica rule, which the agency agreed to pause in April, citing restructuring at NIOSH and technical issues. This administration did not push back against the industry lawsuit in federal appeals court and was granted another delay in October, due to the government shutdown. The Labor Department has also proposed changes that would limit district managers\u2019 authority to force mines to comply with ventilation, roofing and training regulations to carry out Trump\u2019s directive to eliminate bureaucracy.",
      "But at Emery\u2019s black lung clinic in southern West Virginia, far from the lawsuits and the policy changes, all she can think about is one gasping miner arriving after another. Many are still working with limited lung capacity just to keep their health insurance, and they come to her with questions, hoping she can help delay the inevitable. She sees the young ones struggling to throw a football in the yard or make it to school sporting events.",
      "\u201cThese families, you know, they\u2019re my families,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s miners whose kids go to school with my kids.\u201d",
      "The worst ones have the number to her cellphone, which is never turned off. Sometimes they call in a panic, desperate for help.",

      "Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines and left even more people missing as it moved on to slam Vietnam",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Typhoon Kalmaegi has killed at least 114 people in the Philippines with even more missing and then hit Vietnam Friday. A second typhoon, Fong-Wong, is forecast to hit the Philippines around Sunday and strengthen to a major storm by that time.",
      "Some facts about typhoons:",
      "They\u2019re all the same \u2014 officially, tropical cyclones. But they get different names in different parts of the world. Hurricane is used in the Atlantic, Caribbean Sea, central and northeast Pacific. They are typhoons in the northwest Pacific. In the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, they are called cyclones.",
      "Tropical cyclone is used in the southwest India Ocean; in the southwestern Pacific and southeastern India Ocean, they are severe tropical cyclones.",
      "A storm gets a name and is considered a tropical storm at 39 mph (63 kph). It becomes a hurricane, typhoon, tropical cyclone, or cyclone at 74 mph (119 kph). There are five strength categories, depending on wind speed. The highest category is 5 and that\u2019s above 155 mph (249 kph). Australia has a different system for categorizing storm strength.",
      "Kalmaegi is on the stronger side of typhoons, experts said. Its maximum winds in the Philippines reached 132 mph (213 kph), including sustained winds on the ground of 93 mph (150 kph).",
      "The highest tropical cyclone winds recorded were in 2015's Hurricane Patricia in the eastern Pacific, while Typhoon Tip in 1979 had the lowest barometric pressure, which is a key measurement that meteorologists use.",
      "If they are north of the equator they rotate counterclockwise. If they are south, they rotate clockwise.",
      "The Atlantic and central Pacific hurricane seasons are June 1 through Nov. 30. Eastern Pacific is May 15 to Nov. 30; northwestern Pacific season is nearly all year, with the most from May to November. The cyclone season in the south Pacific and Australia runs from November to April. The Bay of Bengal has two seasons, April to June and September to November.",
      "Vietnam tends to get landfalling typhoons around this time of year.",
      "The northwestern Pacific where Typhoon Kalmaegi hit is the busiest place on Earth because of the year-round warm water, weak upper-level crosswinds and frequent thunderstorm activity that can provide the seeds for storms to form, said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany.",

      "By this time of year, the Northwest Pacific averages 23 named storms, 14 of which become typhoons, according to Colorado State University's storm database. A normal year there involves 27 named storms. Kalmaegi and Fung-Wong are the 26th and 27th named storms, with Kalmaegi the 15th typhoon. While there are slightly more storms than normal, Corbosiero said this has been generally a weaker season. The measurement that meteorologists use, which combines storm strength, frequency and duration, shows this season is only 62% of average so far. Kalmaegi is the fourth-strongest typhoon this season.",
      "By comparison the Atlantic averages 14 named storms a year and this year there have been 13, with the last one, Hurricane Melissa, causing major destruction in Jamaica and Cuba.",
      "Because the Northwest Pacific has warm enough water to fuel storms practically year-round, the key often is storminess in the atmosphere to start something going, Corbosiero said. In this case \u2014 and many others \u2014 it's an atmospheric disturbance called the Madden-Julian Oscillation, often called the MJO. This is a natural system in the tropics that starts around the Indian Ocean and moves eastward, increasing rainfall and storminess ahead of it and suppressing thunderstorm activity behind it. It can circle the globe in 30 to 60 days.",
      "A strong MJO can trigger tropical cyclone activity. It did that this summer in the Northwest Pacific but then sort of shut down as the oscillation moved east, Corbosiero said. But a strong one just moved through, helping with these storms' formation, she said.",
      "That MJO is now around the international dateline about a week-and-a-half to two weeks away from the Atlantic, where it could help spawn late season tropical storms, she said.",
      "The lists are maintained by the World Meteorological Organization; the names are ones that are familiar in each region. Names are taken off the list and replaced to avoid confusion if a hurricane causes a lot of damage or deaths. For example, Katrina was retired after it devastated New Orleans in 2005. The Philippines has its own naming system, so Typhoon Kalmaegi is also being called Tino.",

      "The last major atlas of ancient Roman road networks was published 25 years ago. Since then, advances in technology and other newly accessible sources have greatly expanded researchers\u2019 ability to locate ancient roadways.",
      "Over five years, a team of archaeologists combed through historical records, ancient journals, locations of milestones and other archival data.

      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones",
      "Poland and Romania are deploying a new weapons system to defend against Russian drones, following a spate of incursions into NATO airspace in recent months that exposed the alliance\u2019s vulnerabilities and put Europe on edge.",
      "The American Merops system, which is small enough to fit in the back of a midsized pickup truck, can identify drones and close in on them, using artificial intelligence to navigate when satellite and electronic communications are jammed.",
      "As well as being deployed in Poland and Romania, Merops will also be used by Denmark, NATO military officials told The Associated Press, part of a move to boost defenses on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank.",
      "The aim is to make the border with Russia so well-armed that Moscow's forces will be deterred from ever contemplating crossing, from Norway in the north to Turkey in the south, the officials said.",
      "The need for such technology became acute after around 20 Russian drones flew into Polish airspace in early September. Multimillion-dollar jets were scrambled to respond to drones which cost tens of thousands of dollars.",
      "Romania later faced a drone incursion, while drones temporarily closed airports in Copenhagen, Munich, Berlin and Brussels. There were also sightings near military bases in Belgium and Denmark.",
      "While the origin of the drones could not always be traced to Russia or linked to its war in Ukraine, the urgent need to bolster defenses is clear. A protracted drone battle \u2014 or full-scale war as in Ukraine \u2014 would drain Western coffers and limited stocks of missiles.",
      "\u201cWhat this system does is give us very accurate detection,\u201d said Col. Mark McLellan, assistant chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command. \u201cIt\u2019s able to target the drones and take them down and at a low cost as well \u2026 It\u2019s a lot cheaper than flying an F-35 into the air to take them down with a missile.\u201d",
      "Drones fly low and slow, making them hard to pinpoint on radar systems calibrated for spotting high-speed missiles. They can also be mistaken for birds or planes. The Merops system, NATO officials said, helps plug those gaps.",
      "Merops \u201cbasically flies drones against drones,\u201d said McLellan, either by firing directly at the hostile drone or information from the system can be passed to ground or air forces so that they can shoot it down.",
      "Merops gives commanders \u201ca certain amount of time to be able to assess the threat and decide \u2014 to shoot or not shoot,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Thomas Lowin, deputy chief of staff operations at NATO Allied Land Command.",
      "It can be used to protect both critical infrastructure, such as airports, and armed forces maneuvering in a combat zone, he added.",
      "NATO is now deploying the first systems along the borders of Poland and Romania, while Denmark has also decided to acquire the Merops technology, Lowin said.",
      "Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt has invested in Merops, but both he and the company are keeping a low public profile, declining requests for interviews. Defense officials from Poland and Romania also refused to comment publicly.",
      "The Russian incursions have concentrated minds in Europe, highlighting the need for new defenses against a rapidly developing form of warfare. The Merops system is one of many that European militaries would need to tip the scales of a drone war in NATO\u2019s favor.",

      "U.S. military leaders in Europe are also advocating for the creation of an Eastern Flank Deterrence Line, a layered zone of defenses along NATO\u2019s border.",
      "The commanding general for the U.S. Army in Europe and Africa \u2014 and head of NATO\u2019s Allied Land Command \u2014 Gen. Chris Donahue said in July that he wants to create a network of sensors and a command-and-control system that will work with almost any hardware available \u2014 allowing systems to be swapped in and out as they are updated or become obsolete.",
      "Russia has conscription and a large military, which means it has more forces immediately deployable than NATO along its borders. The alliance needs to build defenses which offset that manpower advantage by using its technological capabilities, Donahue said.",
      "Merops is the first phase of building those defenses, said Lowin, a process which is forecast to take two to five years.",
      "The drone incursions and the instability on NATO\u2019s eastern flank stem from Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine, now approaching the end of its fourth year. The conflict has become a crucible for drone development, transforming the battlefield into a testing zone for new technology which now has applications elsewhere in Europe.",
      "The Merops system has been chosen because it has been used successfully in Ukraine. If something doesn\u2019t work there, it\u2019s \u201cprobably not worthwhile acquiring,\u201d Lowin said.",

That's thanks to technological advances and the proliferation of generative AI tools, including video generation tools from OpenAI and Google.",
      "These tools give millions of users the ability to easily spit out content, including for nefarious purposes that range from depicting celebrities Taylor Swift and Katy Perry to disrupting elections and humiliating teens and women.",
      "In response, Denmark is seeking to protect ordinary Danes, as well as performers and artists who might have their appearance or voice imitated and shared without their permission. A bill that's expected to pass early next year would change copyright law by imposing a ban on the sharing of deepfakes to protect citizens\u2019 personal characteristics \u2014 such as their appearance or voice \u2014 from being imitated and shared online without their consent.",
      "If enacted, Danish citizens would get the copyright over their own likeness. In theory, they then would be able to demand that online platforms take down content shared without their permission. The law would still allow for parodies and satire, though it\u2019s unclear how that will be determined.",
      "Experts and officials say the Danish legislation would be among the most extensive steps yet taken by a government to combat misinformation through deepfakes.",
      "Henry Ajder, founder of consulting firm Latent Space Advisory and a leading expert in generative AI, said that he applauds the Danish government for recognizing that the law needs to change.",
      "\u201cBecause right now, when people say \u2018what can I do to protect myself from being deepfaked?\u2019 the answer I have to give most of the time is: \u2018There isn\u2019t a huge amount you can do,\u2019\" he said, \u201dwithout me basically saying, \u2018scrub yourself from the internet entirely.\u2019 Which isn\u2019t really possible.\"",
      "He added: \"We can\u2019t just pretend that this is business as usual for how we think about those key parts of our identity and our dignity.\"",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump signed bipartisan legislation in May that makes it illegal to knowingly publish or threaten to publish intimate images without a person\u2019s consent, including deepfakes. Last year, South Korea rolled out measures to curb deepfake porn, including harsher punishment and stepped up regulations for social media platforms.",
      "Danish Culture Minister Jakob Engel-Schmidt said that the bill has broad support from lawmakers in Copenhagen, because such digital manipulations can stir doubts about reality and spread misinformation.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to deepfake a politician without her or him being able to have that product taken down, that will undermine our democracy,\u201d he told reporters during an AI and copyright conference in September.",
      "The law would apply only in Denmark, and is unlikely to involve fines or imprisonment for social media users. But big tech platforms that fail to remove deepfakes could face severe fines, Engel-Schmidt said.",
      "Ajder said Google-owned YouTube, for example, has a \u201cvery, very good system for getting the balance between copyright protection and freedom of creativity.\"",

    "story": [
      "The lawsuits allege gross negligence and reckless disregard for safety.",
      "The families of multiple campers and two counselors at Camp Mystic who died in the devastating flash flood in Texas in July are suing the camp, alleging gross negligence and reckless disregard for safety led to a \"self-created disaster\" that claimed the lives of 28 people total.",
      "The Fourth of July flood\u00a0wiped out the Christian all-girls sleepaway camp located along the Guadalupe River, which rapidly rose overnight while campers were sleeping. Twenty-five campers, two counselors and the camp's director died after flood waters inundated the camp, trapping many in their cabins.",
      "One of three lawsuits filed Monday includes the families of five campers -- Anna Margaret Bellows, 8; Lila Bonner, 9; Molly DeWitt, 9; Lainey Landry, 9; and Blakely McCrory, 8 -- and the two counselors who died -- Chloe Childress, 18, and Katherine Ferruzzo, 19 -- as plaintiffs.",
      "\"Today, campers Margaret, Lila, Molly, Lainey, and Blakely should be third graders, and counselors Chloe and Katherine should be freshmen at the University of Texas. They all are gone,\" the petition stated. \"And while their families struggle with their loss, the Camp's actions since the tragedy have only deepened the pain.\"",
      "Among the actions, the lawsuit cites the recent announcement that Camp Mystic will partially reopen one of its sister sites next summer and continues to evaluate plans to rebuild the Guadalupe River location.",
      "\"And through it all, the Camp refuses to accept any responsibility for its actions and failures to act, defiantly blaming this tragedy on 'an act of God' that no responsible steps could have avoided,\" the lawsuit alleged.",
      "The lawsuit claims that the camp officials \"focused on profits over safety,\" made \"catastrophic decisions concerning the cabin locations\" and had unsafe policies regarding floods, including an alleged \"never evacuate\" order.",
      "The families are seeking more than $1 million in damages, according to the petition.",
      "\"Our clients have filed this lawsuit to seek accountability and truth,\" one of the families' attorneys, Paul Yetter, said in a statement. \"Camp Mystic failed at its primary job to keep its campers and counselors safe, and young girls died as a result.\u00a0This action is about transparency, responsibility and ensuring no other family experiences what these parents will now suffer the rest of their lives.\"",
      "The second lawsuit against Camp Mystic was filed by the parents of 8-year-old camper Eloise \"LuLu\" Peck.",
      "The lawsuit alleged that the campers and counselors were killed \"after, predictably, the river rapidly rose, and floodwaters swept through what Camp Mystic knew was a vulnerable and low-lying area of the Camp.\"",

      "All three lawsuits are seeking at least $1 million in damages.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Camp Mystic said, \"We continue to pray for the grieving families and ask for God\u2019s healing and comfort.\"",
      "Jeff Ray, legal counsel for Camp Mystic, said in a statement, \"We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area.\"",
      "\"We disagree with several accusations and misinformation in the legal filings regarding the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, who lost his life as well. We will thoroughly respond to these accusations in due course,\" Ray added.",
      "At least 138 people were killed in flash flooding across the Hill Country region, including 117 in Kerr County, officials said.",
      "Officials in hard-hit Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, said that more than 12 inches of rain fell in under 6 hours, and that the Guadalupe River rose more than 20 feet per hour during the storm.",
      "Regulations regarding the development of summer camps in an area known as \"Flash Flood Alley\" and flash-flood warning systems came under scrutiny following the disaster.",

      "In September, Camp Mystic announced plans to reopen one site of its summer camp next year. The summer program officials said that Camp Mystic Cypress Lake, a sister site that opened in 2020, will be open in summer 2026, while Camp Mystic Guadalupe River will not be able to reopen by then due to the devastating damage sustained earlier this year.",
      "\"The heart of Camp Mystic has never stopped beating, because you are Mystic. We are not only rebuilding cabins and trails, but also a place where laughter, friendship and spiritual growth will continue to flourish,\" camp officials said at the time. \"As we work to finalize plans, we will do so in a way that is mindful of those we have lost. You are all part of the mission and the ministry of Camp Mystic. You mean the world to us, and we look forward to welcoming you back inside the green gates.\"",

      "A coalition of retired military nurses and others is pushing to award the Congressional Gold Medal to World War II nurses",
      "DANVILLE, Calif. -- At age 106, Alice Darrow can clearly recall her days as a nurse during World War II, part of a pioneering group that dodged bullets as they hauled packs full of medical supplies and treated the burns and gunshot wounds of troops.",
      "Some nurses were killed by enemy fire. Others spent years as prisoners of war. Most returned home to quiet lives, receiving little recognition.",
      "Darrow sat with patients, even after-hours. One of them had arrived at her hospital on California's Mare Island with a bullet lodged in his heart. He was not expected to survive surgery, yet he would change her life.",
      "\u201cTo them, you\u2019re everything because you\u2019re taking care of them,\u201d she said, sitting at her home in the San Francisco Bay Area town of Danville.",
      "Eighty years after the war ended, a coalition of retired military nurses and others is campaigning to award one of the nation\u2019s highest civilian honors, the Congressional Gold Medal, to all nurses who served in WWII. Other groups, such as the Women Airforce Service Pilots of WWII and the real-life Rosie the Riveters, have already received the honor.",
      "\u201cThe general public doesn\u2019t often recognize, I think, the contribution that the nurses have made in pretty much every war,\u201d said Patricia Upah, a retired colonel who served as an Army nurse in conflicts abroad, and whose late mother was also a Army nurse in the South Pacific in World War II.",
      "Only a handful, like Darrow, are still alive. The coalition knows of five World War II nurses who are still living \u2014 including Elsie Chin Yuen Seetoo, 107, who became the first Chinese American nurse to join the Army Nurse Corps. They fear time is running out to honor the trailblazers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s high time we honor the nurses who stepped up and did their part to defend our freedom,\u201d U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said in a statement.",
      "Baldwin and U.S. Rep. Elise Stefanik, a New York Republican, have sponsored legislation to award the medal, but it faces steep odds. It needs two-thirds of each chamber \u2014 67 cosponsors in the Senate and 290 in the House \u2014 and so far, the bills have eight and six cosponsors, respectively.",
      "Before the war, there were fewer than 600 nurses with the U.S. Army and 1,700 with the U.S. Navy. By the end of the war, those numbers had ballooned to 59,000 in the Army and 14,000 in the Navy.",
      "The Congressional bills cite harrowing examples of bravery. Some nurses served on Navy hospital ships treating patients as the vessels came under fire. Sixty nurses landed off the coast of North Africa on Nov. 8, 1942, to set up shop and care for invading troops.",
      "\u201cWithout weapons, they waded ashore amid enemy sniper fire and ultimately took shelter in an abandoned civilian hospital,\" the legislation states.",
      "The nurses saved lives. Fewer than 4% of U.S. soldiers in WWII who received medical care in the field or underwent evacuation died from wounds or disease, the legislation states.",
      "\u201cThey probably saw more infections. They probably saw more chemical casualties. Remember, they didn\u2019t have disposable products, so they had to sterilize everything,\u201d says Edward Yackel, a retired colonel and president of the Army Nurse Corps Association, of World War II nurses.",
      "\u201cWithout them,\u201d he says, \u201cwe would not have the knowledge base we need now to fight the wars of today.\u201d",
      "Some nurses endured harsh captivity. In 1942, nearly 80 military nurses were captured when the U.S. surrendered the Philippines to Japan. Held as prisoners of war, the women endured starvation rations and disease but continued to work until their liberation three years later.",

      "Conservation groups are suing over a program that authorizes killing brown and black bears as a way to help grow the size of a southwest Alaska caribou herd",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Conservation groups sued Monday over a state program in Alaska that authorizes killing brown bears and black bears as a way to increase the size of a once-significant caribou herd in the southwest part of the state. The groups allege the program lacks a scientific basis and is unconstitutional.",
      "The lawsuit filed in state court says the program adopted by the Alaska Board of Game in July doesn\u2019t require the Department of Fish and Game to monitor bear populations to ensure their numbers remain sustainable. It also says the program \u2014 carried out by department employees and allowing them to shoot from helicopters \u2014 sets no limits on how many bears can be killed in an area that's roughly the size of Indiana.",
      "Filed by Trustees for Alaska on behalf of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance and the Center for Biological Diversity, the lawsuit lists as defendants the state, the board, the Department of Fish and Game and the department's commissioner. A message seeking comment was sent to the Alaska Department of Law, which typically represents state agencies in litigation.",
      "Monday's lawsuit is the latest in an ongoing legal fight over what Fish and Game has cast as an effort to restore the Mulchatna caribou herd. The herd, named for its traditional calving ground, peaked in number at around 190,000 in the late 1990s and had provided an important source of food for subsistence hunters from dozens of communities. But the herd's numbers began falling, down to about 13,000 caribou by 2019, and hunting has not been allowed since 2021, according to the department.",
      "The department has said that factors such as disease, hunting, food availability and quality, and predation can affect caribou survival, and in this case, the board determined it could address predation. It said it's responding to requests to help rebuild the herd and restore the caribou as a food source for the region.",
      "In a fall newsletter, the department said bears and wolves \u201chave been identified as significant calf predators.\u201d It said an aerial survey last fall indicated the ratio of calves to cows in the herd's western subgroup was the highest recorded since 1999. It said this suggested a \u201cpositive response\u201d to its 2023 and 2024 predator control program targeting bears and wolves on calving grounds.",
      "According to the lawsuit, in May 2023 the agency killed \u201cevery single brown and black bear it found within the 1,200-square-mile (3,108-square-kilometer) focus area encompassing the western Mulchatna caribou herd calving grounds.\" Altogether, in 2023 and 2024, 180 bears, most brown bears, were killed, the lawsuit says.",
      "The Alaska Wildlife Alliance previously sued to end the program. In that case, a judge in March found fault with the process in which it was adopted and concluded the state lacked data on bear sustainability in the region before implementing the program.",
      "But the board and department pushed ahead, implementing emergency regulations under which 11 bears were killed before those were struck down by another judge.",

      "\u201cWe were trying to rebuild the caribou herd, but we\u2019re not going to jeopardize long-term sustainability of bears in so doing,\u201d the department\u2019s commissioner, Doug Vincent-Lang, said in a statement after the board's action.",
      "He said there was \u201cstrong evidence that neither disease nor nutrition are preventing this herd from recovering,\" and that predation \u201chas been isolated as the limiting factor preventing the herd from growing.\u201d",
      "Nicole Schmitt, executive director of the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, said the program \"threatens bears who move across vast stretches of public lands.\u201d",
      "Schmitt in a statement Monday said sections of the area in which bears can be killed are near Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Katmai National Park and Preserve and near wildlife refuges.",
      "Michelle Sinnott, staff attorney with Trustees for Alaska, called the program unconstitutional. She said it \"hands Fish and Game a blank check to destroy bears across an entire region with impunity. The Board of Game has once again shirked its constitutional obligations and ignored prior court decisions in its unscientific and relentless war on predator animals.\u201d",

I just can\u2019t get you ready for the next exercise because now, probably, the exercise has been changed entirely,\u201d Hashem said.",

      "The chaos at the February meeting in Coeur d'Alene drew widespread attention with videos posted online going viral showing the woman being pulled from the audience after heckling the speakers. The video showed Kootenai County Sheriff Bob Norris telling Teresa Borrenpohl to leave, and then stepping back and recording on his cellphone as multiple unidentified men approached and began grabbing her, dragging her out of the meeting. The men were security officers with LEAR Asset Management, but were not wearing any identification or uniforms, and witnesses said they repeatedly refused to identify themselves.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Tennessee death row inmate Harold Wayne Nichols on Monday declined to choose between the electric chair and lethal injection for his Dec. 11 execution, meaning the state will default to lethal injection.",
      "Nichols was sentenced to death in 1990 after he was convicted of raping and murdering Karen Pulley, a 21-year-old student at Chattanooga State University, two years earlier. He has two weeks to change his mind about choosing which method will be used, Tennessee Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter said in an email.",
      "He was scheduled to be executed in 2020, and had chosen the electric chair, but was then given a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tennessee inmates who were convicted of crimes before January 1999 are permitted to choose electrocution over the state's preferred method of lethal injection. Although several states still permit the use of the electric chair, it has only been used five times in the past decade, all in Tennessee.",
      "At the time that Nichols selected electrocution, Tennessee's lethal injection protocol used three different drugs in series. It was a process that inmates' attorneys claimed was riddled with problems. Their concerns were shown to have merit in 2022, when Gov. Bill Lee paused executions, including a second execution date for Nichols. An independent review of the state's lethal injection process found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed in Tennessee since 2018 had been properly tested.",

      "GREENBELT, Md. -- U.S. government attorneys say they have cleared all the hurdles needed to send Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Liberia and are asking a federal judge to dissolve an order blocking his deportation.",
      "Abrego Garcia's mistaken deportation to his home country of El Salvador earlier this year has helped galvanize opposition to President Donald Trump's immigration policies. His attorneys claim the administration is now manipulating the immigration system in order to punish him for successfully challenging that deportation.",
      "A motion from the government filed in U.S. District Court in Maryland late on Friday says officials have received assurances from Liberia that Abrego Garcia would not face persecution or torture there. Further, it says an immigration officer heard Abrego Garcia's claims that he feared deportation to the West African nation, but ruled against him.",
      "His attorneys argue in a separate Friday filing that Abrego Garcia has already designated Costa Rica as a country where he is willing to be deported. They claim the government now must send him there. The fact that officials continue to pursue deportation to other countries is evidence that the process is retaliatory and violates due process protections, they argue.",
      "Abrego Garcia has an American wife and child and has lived in Maryland for years, but he immigrated to the U.S. illegally from El Salvador as a teenager. In 2019, an immigration judge granted him protection from being deported back to his home country, finding he faced danger there. But in March, he was deported to El Salvador anyway in what a government attorney later said was an administrative error. Facing pressure from the courts, the administration brought him back to the U.S. in June but has since been pursuing his deportation to a third country.",
      "Much of Abrego Garcia's argument against his deportation to Liberia hinges on due process claims. The government tries to tear down those claims, arguing that his due process rights are not the same as a U.S. citizen's. Because he entered the country illegally, he should be treated the same as someone who just crossed the border, they argue.",

      "As part of his due process rights, his attorneys also say he is entitled to have an immigration judge review the immigration officer's determination that Abrego Garcia is unlikely to be persecuted or tortured in Liberia. They argue the officer should have considered the fact that Liberia could re-deport Abrego Garcia to El Salvador. And they say the Liberian government has only agreed to accept him on a temporary basis.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration made a $7.5 million payment to the government of Equatorial Guinea as it seeks to deport people to the West African country and draws closer to its heavily prosecuted leaders, according to the top Democratic senator on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said in a letter sent Monday to Secretary of State Marco Rubio and obtained by The Associated Press that \u201cthis highly unusual payment \u2014 to one of the most corrupt governments in the world \u2014 raises serious concerns over the responsible, transparent use of American taxpayer dollars.\"",
      "Shaheen said in her letter that the $7.5 million payment stood out because it would would \u201cfar exceed the amount of U.S. foreign assistance provided over the last 8 years combined\u201d to the country.",
      "The payment, made from a fund for migration and refugee assistance, would be the first government-to-government transfer from that account, which was set up by Congress to respond to humanitarian crises. She questioned whether the payment was a permissible use of the money.",

As Secretary Rubio has said, we remain unwavering in our commitment to end illegal and mass immigration and bolster America\u2019s border security.\u201d",
      "As the Trump administration looks to Africa for further deportations, the payment raised questions about how it is enmeshing its deportation agenda with other foreign policy goals, as well as the international leaders it is willing to trust.",
      "The Trump administration, in aiming to ramp up deportations, has sought to forge agreements with countries to take in migrants who are not their citizens.

      "NEW YORK -- A convicted drug dealer who had been granted clemency by President Donald Trump was sent back to federal prison on Monday for violating the terms of his release after being charged with several new crimes.",
      "Jonathan Braun was sentenced to 27 months behind bars.",
      "The Long Island man had been accused of swinging an IV pole at a hospital nurse and threatening to kill her, screaming at a member of his synagogue, groping his family\u2019s nanny and evading bridge tolls.",
      "Brooklyn federal Judge Kiyo Matsumoto said she hoped Braun's \u201cexpressions of remorse\u201d and promises to \u201clead a law abiding life\u201d were in good faith, noting that many of the people who he had harmed have since forgiven him.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t squander it,\u201d she said to Braun.",
      "Prosecutors had sought a five-year sentence, the maximum punishment allowed, arguing that a lengthy stint behind bars was \u201cnecessary to protect the public from further crimes.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe defendant\u2019s brazen and violent conduct caused fear and terror in his victims,\u201d prosecutors wrote in a court filing ahead of his sentencing. Braun, they said, has continued to show that he is a \u201cserious danger to the community.\"",

      "Since returning to jail, she said, Braun has been meeting with a psychiatrist, gotten sober and worked to rebuild his faith and community support, talking with a rabbi twice a week and expressing remorse to him for his actions. Braun's conduct, she said, was driven by addiction.",
      "\u201cThe past seven months in custody have given Mr. Braun significant time to reflect on the very serious harm his behavior caused, and to take steps to ensure that he can be successful on supervision moving forward,\u201d Wozencroft wrote to the judge ahead of the hearing.",

He served about a year behind bars before Trump commuted his sentence in the final days of his first term in January 2021. Braun was freed from prison, but the rest of his sentence remained intact, including requirements that he pay a fine and stay out of trouble.",
      "Braun had been a high-ranking member of an international group that smuggled more than 100,000 kilograms (220,460 pounds) of marijuana from Canada into the United States, federal prosecutors said at the time.",
      "In January, prosecutors said, Braun cursed at nurses and argued with an assistant nurse manager in the emergency department at a Long Island hospital, picking up an IV pole that was connected to his arm and swinging it in her direction as she approached and attempted to calm him down.",
      "Braun's wife was also screaming at hospital staff, prosecutors said. When the assistant nurse manager said that she would have to leave, Braun tore into the assistant nurse manager, walking toward her until he was stopped by hospital security, yelling profanities and repeatedly saying that he was going to kill her, prosecutors said.",
      "In February, prosecutors said, Braun entered the bedroom of his children\u2019 family\u2019s live-in nanny, wrapped an arm around her upper body and used the other to put her in a headlock before grabbing her breasts and making unwanted sexual advances. The nanny testified in court that Braun\u2019s actions made her so uncomfortable that she locked herself in a bathroom, called her husband and asked him to notify police.",
      "In March, prosecutors said, Braun grabbed and threatened a fellow worshipper who asked him to be quiet during a synagogue service. After stepping away for about 10 minutes, Braun allegedly got in the man's face, squeezed his right arm tightly and asked him: \u201cDo you know who I am?\u201d and \u201cDo you know what I could have done to do you?\u201d",
      "Braun's infractions didn't end there. Last summer, police said, he evaded bridge tolls at least 40 times while driving his luxury cars, accruing $160 in unpaid fees.",

      "CAPE TOWN, South Africa -- U.S. President Donald Trump says that the United States government will boycott the Group of 20 summit this month in South Africa over his claims that a white minority group in that country is being violently persecuted.",
      "Trump announced Friday on Truth Social that no U.S. government official will attend the Nov. 22-23 summit in Johannesburg \u201cas long as these Human Rights abuses continue.\u201d It was his latest criticism of the Black-led South African government, which has been a regular target for Trump since he returned to office.",
      "In February, Trump issued an executive order stopping U.S. financial assistance to South Africa, citing its treatment of the Afrikaner white minority. The administration has also prioritized Afrikaners for refugee status in the U.S. and says they will be given most of the 7,500 places available this fiscal year.",
      "The South African government \u2014 and some Afrikaners themselves \u2014 say Trump's claims of persecution are baseless.",
      "Afrikaners are South Africans who are descended mainly from Dutch but also French and German colonial settlers who first came to the country in the 17th century.",
      "Afrikaners were at the heart of the apartheid system of white minority rule from 1948-1994, leading to decades of hostility between them and South Africa's Black majority. But Afrikaners are not a homogenous group, and some fought against apartheid. There are an estimated 2.7 million Afrikaners in South Africa\u2019s population of 62 million.",
      "Afrikaners themselves are divided over Trump's claims. Some say they face discrimination, but a group of leading Afrikaner business figures and academics said in an open letter last month that \u201cthe narrative that casts Afrikaners as victims of racial persecution in post-apartheid South Africa\u201d is misleading.",
      "Afrikaners' Dutch-derived language is widely spoken in South Africa and is an official language, while Afrikaners are represented in every aspect of society. Afrikaners are some of South Africa's richest entrepreneurs, some of its most successful sports stars, and also serve in government and are largely committed to South Africa's multiracial democracy.",
      "Trump said on Truth Social that Afrikaners \u201care being killed and slaughtered, and their land and farms are being illegally confiscated.\u201d The president's comments are in reference to a relatively small number of attacks on Afrikaner farmers that he and others claim are racially motivated.",
      "Trump has also pointed to a highly contentious law introduced by the South African government that allows land to be appropriated from private owners without compensation. Some Afrikaners fear that law is aimed at removing them from their land in favor of South Africa's poor Black majority. Many South Africans, including opposition parties, have criticized the law, but it hasn't led to land confiscations.",
      "The South African government said in response to Trump's Truth Social post that his claims were \"not substantiated by fact.\" It has said that Trump's monthslong criticism of South Africa over Afrikaners is a result of misinformation because it misses the context that Black farmers and farmworkers are also killed in rural attacks, which make up a tiny percentage of the high violent crime rates.",

      "President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House, marking a significant shift in U.S.-Syria relations",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump hosted Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa at the White House on Monday, welcoming the once-pariah state into a U.S.-led global coalition to fight the Islamic State group.",
      "Al-Sharaa arrived at the White House around 11:30 a.m. for his Oval Office meeting, which was closed to the press. The Syrian president entered the building through West Executive Avenue, adjacent to the White House, rather than on the West Wing driveway normally used for foreign leaders' arrivals. He left the White House about two hours later and greeted a throng of supporters gathered outside before getting into his motorcade.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll do everything we can to make Syria successful because that\u2019s part of the Middle East,\u201d Trump told reporters later Monday. The U.S. president said of al-Sharaa that \u201cI have confidence that he\u2019ll be able to do the job.\" Trump said later on his social media site that he plans to meet and speak with the Syrian leader again.",
      "Al-Sharaa, in an interview on Fox News, said he and Trump talked about investment opportunities in Syria in the future, \"so that Syria is no longer looked at as a security threat. It is now looked at as a geopolitical ally. And it\u2019s a place where the United States can have great investments, especially extracting gas.\u201d",
      "Syria formally confirmed that it would join the global coalition against the Islamic State group during al-Sharaa's visit, becoming its 90th member, according to a senior U.S. administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity because there hadn\u2019t yet been a formal announcement. The U.S. will also allow Syria to resume operations at its embassy in Washington so the two countries can better coordinate on counterterrorism, security and economic issues, the official said.",
      "Syria\u2019s foreign ministry, in a statement, described the meeting as \u201cfriendly and constructive\u201d and said Trump \u201caffirmed the readiness of the United States to provide the support that the Syrian leadership needs to ensure the success of the reconstruction and development process.\u201d",
      "The ministry said U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio had then met with Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani and Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, who arrived in Washington on Monday, and that they agreed to proceed with implementing an agreement reached in March between Damascus and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces to integrate the SDF into the new Syrian army. Implementation of the deal has repeatedly stalled amid tensions between the two sides. It was unclear what concrete steps were agreed upon in Monday\u2019s meeting.",
      "The statement said the \u201cAmerican side also affirmed its support for reaching a security agreement with Israel,\u201d but it did not say how Syria had responded.",
      "Al-Sharaa's visit was the first to the White House by a Syrian head of state since the Middle Eastern country gained independence from France in 1946 and comes after the U.S. lifted sanctions imposed on Syria during the decades the country was ruled by the Assad family. Al-Sharaa led the rebel forces that toppled Syrian President Bashar Assad last December and was named the country\u2019s interim leader in January.",
      "Trump and al-Sharaa \u2014 who once had ties to al-Qaida and had a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head \u2014 first met in May in Saudi Arabia. At the time, the U.S. president described al-Sharaa as a \"young, attractive guy. Tough guy. Strong past, very strong past. Fighter.\" It was the first official encounter between the U.S. and Syria since 2000, when then-President Bill Clinton met with Hafez Assad, the father of Bashar Assad.",
      "Before al-Sharaa's arrival in the U.S., the United Nations Security Council voted to lift sanctions on the Syrian president and other government officials in a move that the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., Mike Waltz, said was a strong sign that Syria is in a new era since the fall of Assad.",

He wants a permanent repeal of sanctions that punished Syria for widespread allegations of human rights abuses by Assad\u2019s government and security forces. While the Caesar Act sanctions are currently waived by Trump, a permanent repeal would require Congress to act.",

The other was drafted by Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a hawkish Trump ally who wants to set conditions for a sanctions repeal that would be reviewed every six months.",
      "But advocates argue that any repeal with conditions would prevent companies from investing in Syria because they would fear potentially being sanctioned. Mouaz Moustafa, executive director of the Syrian Emergency Task Force, likened it to a \u201changing shadow that paralyzes any initiatives for our country.\u201d",

      "For his current role, he's making choices, too, mostly just to be himself. \"Well, I mean I pretty much am playing myself if I were a landman.\"",
      "In the Paramount+ show \"Landman,\" viewers get a peek behind the curtain of a world we really usually see. \"I mean, the movie 'Giant,' one of my favorites, I mean, that took place in the oil business of West Texas,\" he said. \"I always tell people that this is kind of like 'Giant,' with cursing!\"",
      "Fans have been waiting a long time for \"Landman\"'s second season. It debuts next Sunday.",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 2 of \"Landman\" click on the video player below:",
      "According to his co-star Ali Larter, Thornton doesn't like to rehearse. \"You have to be ready to go,\" she told us. \"Fresh. Like, whatever happens is going to happen.\"",
      "Thornton's hillbilly vibe isn't a put-on \u2013 he proudly calls himself a Tex-Arkansan, the product of a lot of rural places that even the railroads passed by.",
      "But he wouldn't trade growing up in a small town for anything: \"You know, I keep my upbringing in my back pocket all the time,\" he said. \"You never forget it.\"",
      "While he never worked on an oil rig, he did have his fair share of jobs where dangerous machinery decided if you came home at night or not. \"Machine shops and sawmills are both not exactly the safest places to work, especially when you're a dumb little skinny hippie kid with hair to your waist,\" he said. \"We always had a joke about sawmill workers, which was, do you know what this is? [He holds up three fingers.] It's a sawmill worker ordering five beers.\"",
      "He went from sawdust to Hollywood fairy dust in a pretty unconventional way. \"I only took drama 'cause I thought I gotta get a C in something, you know, because I was not good in school,\" he said.",
      "His idols were Robert Duvall, Bruce Dern, and Sam Elliott. But in Los Angeles, at a cocktail party where Thornton was working as a bus boy, famed screenwriter and director Billy Wilder told him acting wasn't for him.",
      "\"He said, 'Forget about it. You're too ugly to be a leading man,'\" Thornton recalled. \"And he said, 'You're too pretty to be a character actor.' I said, 'What do I do?' He said, 'Can you write?' I said, 'Yeah, I do write.' He goes, 'Write your own stories, create your own characters, don't stand in line with everybody else.'\"",
      "He did write his own story, and create his own character. \"Sling Blade\" (1996), which he wrote and directed, earned him an Academy Award for best adapted screenplay, and an Oscar nomination for best actor to boot.",
      "Asked if he thinks he'll go back to writing and directing, he replied, \"You know, I don't know that anybody wants to see what I have to say as a director or writer, 'cause all my stuff is based on Southern literature. And I don't think that those stories would really be relevant to anyone right now. So, I doubt I ever do it again.\"",
      "Letting go of things he loves isn't easy. We were stunned to find out he hasn't felt truly care-free since the short-lived TV show \"The Outsiders\" \u2013 more than 30 years ago. \u00a0\"I had no responsibility,\" he said. \"I was making $2,500 an episode. Never thought I'd see that kind of money. Then, my brother Jimmy died, and changed my life. He was my best friend.\"",
      "\"So, that's when you talk about carrying it around in your back pocket?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, yeah, yeah.\"",
      "They both grew up playing in bands. To this day, Billy Bob still idolizes his brother's musical talent. \"He played every instrument, except drums,\" Thornton said. \"He looked like he had a disorder when he tried to play drums.\"",
      "Thornton never gave up his love of music. His band, The Boxmasters, has recorded 19 albums, and this past Summer they opened for The Who. \"We're just there to waste 45 minutes while they're getting ready, ya' know?\" he said. \"So hopefully the fans will be with us.\"",
      "He doesn't act his age, and in hindsight we probably shouldn't have asked about it.",
      "\"Any thoughts on turning 70?\" I said.",
      "\"What did you say\" Thornton replied, raising an eyebrow. \"But uh, no, You know what, it's so funny you're scared of every milestone. But this one actually did affect me in a way that I had to, you know, have a few meetings with myself late at night.\"",
      "In the end, what Billy Bob Thornton has found is that he and so many of his older contemporaries, including his friend Sam Elliott (who is still acting with him at 81), are still defined by their good work.",
      "\"We've all seen each other get older,\" Thornton said. \"And when I see that wisdom and see the respect that people have for them, it just kind of makes everything melt away somehow. I mean, I'm in a successful band and I'm in a successful show. Every day when I wake up, I just say I'm blessed. That's really it.\"",

    "published": "Sun, 09 Nov 2025 09:53:12 -0500",
    "summary": "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Oscar-nominee Jessie Buckley's latest role, playing the wife of William Shakespeare in \"Hamnet,\" may change that.",
    "story": [
      "She's been called \"the acting world's best-kept secret.\" But Jessie Buckley's latest role, in the film \"Hamnet,\" may change that. As Rolling Stone put it, people \"will be talking about Jessie Buckley's performance for years.\"",
      "Buckley plays the wife of William Shakespeare (portrayed by fellow Irish actor Paul Mescal). Adapted from Maggie O'Farrell's novel, it's a fictionalized tale about the death of Shakespeare's son, Hamnet. It imagines the tragedy inspired him to write \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"I just knew I had to go somewhere mentally, emotionally,\" Buckley said of her work.",
      "I said, \"You have this fire inside you \u2013 that's what we see on film.\"",
      "\"I don't know, do you?\" she replied.",
      "\"I'd say so, in what I've seen, you see it!\"",
      "\"I have fire, but I tell you what 'Hamnet' gave me, which I also was looking for, was tenderness. And sometimes it's just as strong as fire.\"",
      "She said when she started shooting the more difficult scenes, like the death of her child, she told her husband she needed to go away for two weeks. So, Buckley came to Hampstead Heath, a vast green space in London, where she'd go swimming each morning. \"I just need to be in nature and start my day and wake up that way, and then go to the set and see what came out,\" she said.",
      "She says \"Hamnet\" director Chlo\u00e9 Zhao (an Oscar-winner for \"Nomadland\") reminded her cinema is not just escapism. \"Our jobs as actors and the storytellers are to touch the most heightened expressions that are too hard to hold on our own,\" Buckley said. \"I get to incubate the bits of us, myself, the shadow bits.\"",
      "\"What are the shadow bits of you that came out for this role?\" I asked.",
      "\"I'm not telling you!\" she laughed. \"You have to watch it and make up your own mind.\"",
      "\"The sacred flame of star quality\"",
      "Her breakthrough role was playing a single mom just out of prison in 2018's \"Wild Rose.\" Then, in 2022, Buckley got an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress in \"The Lost Daughter.\" Her other credits included \"I'm Thinking of Ending Things,\" \"Beast\" and \"Women Talking,\" and the TV series \"Fargo.\"",
      "She said, \"I never in a million years thought I'd make a film.\"",
      "Because? \"I didn't have a TV 'til I was 15,\" she said. \"And it was exotic, like, it was in Hollywood. It wasn't in Kerry.\"",
      "In rugged County Kerry, in Ireland's southeast, Buckley grew up in an artistic family, playing harp, clarinet and piano. She sang and did school productions. But it was the British talent show, \"I'd Do Anything,\" that put her on a bigger stage \u2013 and in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber. He praised her, saying, \"Jessie has the sacred flame of star quality.\"",
      "She lost that competition, but quickly landed theater roles. Her first Shakespeare performance was near the spot in London where Shakespeare's early plays were first performed, at the original Rose Playhouse, built in 1587.",
      "Shakespeare changed everything for her: \"I think before, I felt like music was the only way to contain what was kind of wanting to come out, and then Shakespeare's words and his worlds were so titanic that it just made me realize how powerful words could be,\" she said.",
      "Of acting opposite Mescal in \"Hamnet,\" Buckley said, \"I absolutely adore that man. And from our very first chemistry read \u2026\"",
      "\"Chemistry read is to make sure you have chemistry?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" she laughed. \"I mean, it would be really depressing if I didn't, wouldn't it? I'd be like the only woman in the world who failed to find chemistry with Paul Mescal!\"",
      "The 35-year-old actor says she also found chemistry with Christian Bale for her next film, in which she plays the bride of Frankenstein's monster. Directed by Maggie Gyllenhall, it's genre- and expectation-bending.\u00a0 \"It's punk, it is proper punk,\" Buckley said. \"I remember when I read it first, it was like being plugged into an electrical socket.\"",
      "I said, \"Maggie Gyllenhaal referred to you as kind of a wild animal.\"",
      "\"Hmm. Good,\" Buckley said.",
      "\"Do you think there's a truth to that?\"",
      "\"I have a lot of life in me!\"",
      "That life and vitality that we now see on film is the journey that brought Buckley to London as a teenager. At the time, she says, she was in a dark place. \"I had depression and I wasn't very well,\" she said. \"And I wanted a lot from life. I was really hungry for it. And I felt like there was no place for that. And I think that's when it imploded in on me, and when I got sick and lost myself, you know?\"",
      "\"How did your deal with it?\"",
      "\"I got help,\" she replied. \"I got therapy. Singing. I mean, I honestly think it's kind of saved me. Something wasn't alive then, let's just say, like it is now.\"",

      "People often discuss which Hollywood star might play them in a movie about their life. For legendary boxer Christy Martin, the actor turned out to be Sydney Sweeney. Sweeney transformed into \"Christy,\" which hits theaters on Nov. 7.",
      "Before Martin's story was told on the big screen, she sat down with \"48 Hours\" in 2020 to share her story.\u00a0An encore of \"Christy Martin \u2013 the Fight of her Life\"\u00a0airs Saturday, Nov. 8, at 9/8c on CBS and streams on Paramount+.",
      "Raised as a coal miner's daughter in a small town in West Virginia, to becoming a world championship boxer, Martin made headlines as a pioneer in women's boxing. But few knew of the personal battles she was facing outside the ring.",
      "In the episode, \"48 Hours\" details the story of Martin's struggles with identity, acceptance, drug addiction, and domestic violence at the hands of her former husband and trainer, Jim Martin. \"The same story that you guys got, Sydney puts out there for the people to see and to gain inspiration from,\" Martin recently told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Sweeney spent months preparing for the role, including intense boxing training to recreate Martin's actual fights. In addition to physical preparations, Sweeney told \"48 Hours\" about the research she did to play Christy. \"I mean, I had a lot to be able to pull from and go off of. She had her book, there was the '48 Hours' special \u2026 There were interviews and fight footage. So there was a lot I could prepare with before I met Christy, and then I had Christy in my corner, so I was able to ask her questions and have her by my side and be able to watch her.\"",
      "Martin requested the writers not to \"Hollywoodize\" her life as they scripted her story. Martin said writer Mirrah Foulkes responded, \"There's enough crazy s*** that's happened in your life, we don't have to.\"",
      "As her survival story continues to reach more people, Martin hopes it can help inspire others. \"We're showing a pathway to get out of a domestic violence situation. We're showing how important it is for parents, relatives, friends to be accepting of someone who's a little different ... But I'm the ultimate underdog \u2026 If you can believe it, you can achieve it. Dream big. My Dad used to tell me to dream big, and I think I did.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "\"If you're going to do science, why not discover something important?\" That, James Watson (April 6, 1928-Nov. 6, 2025) told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" in 2003, was his motivation when, at age 23, he arrived at Cambridge University eager to take on the mysteries of DNA.",
      "A zoologist who'd just earned his Ph.D. in Chicago, Watson teamed up with the brilliant physicist Francis Crick, who was 12 years his senior. As Crick theorized, Watson built models, burning through idea after idea. \"You're obsessed,\" Watson explained. \"It's like being obsessed with a girl or something. You know, she's there, and you can't get her out of your mind.\"",
      "The team had competition, from researchers at King's College in London, and from Linus Pauling in America. When Maurice Wilkins at King's College showed him an X-ray of a DNA molecule, taken by colleague Rosalind Franklin, Watson saw the direction he had to go: a double helix.",
      "On Feb. 28, 1953, Watson and Crick walked into a pub off the Cambridge campus and announced that they'd discovered the secret to life. Their theory about the double-helix structure of DNA appeared in the British science journal Nature that April. In 1962, Watson, Crick and Wilkins shared the Nobel Prize for divining the structure of DNA \u2014 key to understanding how genetic material works. Their discovery opened the door to genetic engineering, gene therapy, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples, tracing family trees via DNA, and monoclonal antibodies.",
      "Beyond years spent at the California Institute of Technology and Harvard University (where he helped create their program for molecular biology), Watson later helped lead the human genome project, which accelerated genetic research. But while the birth of Dolly the sheep in 1996 suggested that the concept of cloning wasn't mere science fiction, Watson himself wasn't comfortable with the possibilities. \"You can just imagine 200 Meg Ryans in New York City. You know, it would be a mess,\" he said.",
      "In 2007 he was suspended from his job as chancellor of the prestigious Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York after he was widely condemned for making racist remarks. He retired shortly after. His inflammatory tendencies were evident years before. In his bestselling 1968 book about the DNA discovery, \"The Double Helix,\" Watson wrote, \"A goodly number of scientists are not only narrow-minded and dull, but also just stupid.\"",
      "For success in science, he wrote: \"You have to avoid dumb people. ... To make a huge success, a scientist has to be prepared to get into deep trouble.\""

      "Music released between Aug. 31, 2024, and Aug. 30, 2025, was eligible for the 2026 Grammy nominations \u2014 meaning some notable recent winners, including Beyonc\u00e9 and Taylor Swift, were not eligible for nominations.",
      "The nominations include some historical firsts. For Lamar, \"GNX\" is his fifth consecutive studio album to be nominated for album of the year, something no other artist has ever done. It's the first time Lady Gaga has been nominated for song, record and album of the year simultaneously. Bad Bunny also became the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for song, record and album of the year in the same year, according to Variety.",
      "This year's awards include two new categories: best traditional country album and best album cover. The existing best country album category was renamed to best contemporary country album.",
      "The traditional country album category is \"a response to kind of more traditional sounding artists who may have felt a little overshadowed on the country charts,\" Christian Hoard, executive music editor for \"Rolling Stone,\" told CBS News.",

      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

      "Excerpt from an advocacy speech given in 2015 by Carrie Salter-Richardson",
      "My father was diagnosed at the age of 36 with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease. He had already lost his mother and two of his brothers. He and his younger brother were diagnosed about the same time, and for seven years, I watched my dad and my uncle slowly wither away. On August 22, 1996, my father turned 43. A friend drove me to the nursing home to take him balloons and wish him happy birthday. I struggled with my faith as a young teenager but on that day, I prayed to God for my father's death. I knew when I left there, it would be the last time I would see him alive, if that's what you want to call it. My dad died the next day.",
      "We didn't really speak about Alzheimer's again until 2009 when I got a call from a long-lost relative letting me know that my oldest cousin had been diagnosed and was already in a nursing home. He died two months later at the age of 37. After his death, we began to do some research and discovered DIAN or the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network. They helped us determine that our family carries the PSEN1 gene, and we enrolled in an observational study at Washington University in St. Louis.",
      "As part of the study, we were offered genetic testing to determine if we carried the same gene mutation. My brother Bryan was the first to have the genetic test done. Bryan and I are 18 months apart. We've always been best friends. He was always the best at everything. He excelled at sports and performing arts. He was popular and outgoing and the funniest person I know. When I got the phone call that he had tested positive for the gene, a piece of me died.",
      "On December 4, 2012, I drove to UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham) to hear my results. I remember sitting in a little room for what seemed like hours waiting for the doctor and genetic counselor. When the door finally opened, I knew my answer. It was written all over their faces. But to hear the words, \"It's not good news,\" took the wind out of me. I showed little emotion while the doctor was talking. I just nodded my head and thought about sitting in that nursing home with my dad. I thought about how I would tell my children. Would they too pray for my death? I knew there were many people waiting for my phone call and hoping for good news. I dreaded making those phone calls.",
      "For a few weeks, I let it consume me, felt sorry for myself, and spent a lot of time crying. But I knew there were three people who depended on me, so I decided to make a lifetime of heartache into a quest for hope. I joined a clinical trial through DIAN. I became a volunteer for the Walk to End Alzheimer's, which led me to become a congressional ambassador for the Alzheimer's Association. I've traveled to Washington, DC, to meet with representatives and senators, advocating for more federal funding for Alzheimer's. I've been to the Montgomery statehouse. I'm now the chair of the walk. I don't ever want my children to see me give up. I don't want them to feel hopeless.",
      "It is my hope that my story and the stories of others just like me will start a conversation and end the stigma that comes along with this disease. Just maybe I can bring a new face to Alzheimer's so people know that it can happen to anybody, not just the elderly. I don't know where my story will end. But I do know that I will never give up hope for a world without Alzheimer's.",
      "* * * * *",
      "In the spring of 2021, I spoke with Carrie and planned a trip to Montgomery, Alabama, to photograph her and her brother Bryan.",
      "Carrie told me, \"I was 15 when my dad died, but when he was diagnosed, I was only seven. I didn't understand. Nobody ever really tried to educate us about it. My dad was the last one to die of the kids that got it. After that, we didn't even think about it anymore. We just kind of went on with our lives as far as Alzheimer's was concerned.",
      "\"Growing up with my dad's illness \u2014 him and my youngest uncle are like Bryan and I, the same distance apart in age \u2014 they went through it together. Because we didn't understand the symptoms of the disease, we were really embarrassed by our dad. We didn't want our friends to be around him. We laughed at everything he did and said. It was silly. It's hard to look back and think the last years I had with my dad were me just being embarrassed by him. He played baseball in college. He played minor league baseball for the Phillies. He did a lot of great stuff, but all that we remember now is how his life ended in a nursing home. He weighed 70 pounds on a feeding tube in a nursing home.\"",
      "I asked Carrie how that experience informed her decision to become a vocal advocate and she replied, \"I didn't know how the reactions would be, putting it all out there. Trying to break that stigma. It really helped me heal from the devastation of the news. I think that it showed my kids that I'm not going to just lie down and cry and do nothing. I'm going to try to educate people. Of course, I'm not an expert on the disease at all, but I think the best thing I ever did was to sit down and talk with my kids, because it inspired my daughter Hannah to want to do something about it.",
      "\"My oldest daughter is a student at WashU. She's a sophomore. She is working as an undergrad in an Alzheimer's research lab right now. It's really awesome. She's actually my best friend. She's at school now, so it's hard.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does she give back to you with messages of encouragement or hope? What does she say back to you now that she's an adult?\"",
      "\"She just tells me that she's proud of me, and she'll tell me if I'm slipping up on stuff. She's kind of like a mama bear, but she's a nine-hour drive away. We FaceTime a lot. She calls me every day just to make sure I'm good.\"",
      "I asked Carrie, \"Do you talk to your brother (Bryan) about how you're feeling and how he's feeling?\"",
      "\"We just make jokes about it to each other, because I feel like we're the only ones that can joke about it. He's very witty. He comes up with some really funny stuff. We don't sit there and have deep discussions about it, because he doesn't think that he is symptomatic, and everybody else knows that he is, and I'm not going to tell him otherwise. We just kind of interact the same way we always have, which is by goofing off, joking around.\"",
      "\"Does Bryan have kids too?\"",
      "\"No. He's gay. He never had kids. I'm the only one that had children, which makes me feel very guilty. I do carry a lot of guilt for that, because now they all have a 50 percent chance of developing it as well.",
      "\"My mom would have you think I'm about halfway in my grave. She's a hard one to deal with. I give her a hard time, but Bryan does need the help, and she does help me with a lot of stuff too. If I get stressed, she'll do my healthcare and all the things that really frustrate me. For some reason, I get stressed out so easily. She'll do it. She'll fill it out for me. She's helpful, but then she's also overbearing. Maybe that's how all moms are. I don't know.",
      "\"I know the differences that are happening with me, and my kids definitely know. They mention it. I do get flustered a lot easier than I used to. I used to be able to manage a lot more things on my plate than I can manage now. Just little things. I try to write everything down in a planner, but then I forget to look at my planner. I do have bouts of crying spells, which is weird for me, because I've not done that before. I won't even know why I'm crying. I'm just crying.\"",
      "* * * * *",
      "A few weeks later, I was able to photograph Bryan and Carrie together in the backyard of their mother Mary's house in Montgomery. A few years ago, Bryan was struggling to live on his own and had to move back home from Atlanta. Mary is now Bryan's primary care partner. She helps Bryan with life's daily tasks and helped secure him a job at a local nursery where he can still enjoy work but in a safe and caring environment. Carrie had told me ahead of time that, despite only being eighteen months older than her, Bryan's Alzheimer's is much more advanced, and he has trouble communicating.",
      "I asked Bryan and Carrie what they would tell someone who was newly diagnosed.",
      "Bryan looked at Carrie and blurted, \"You go first!\" Carrie laughed and responded, \"When you're first diagnosed, at that moment you think it's the end of the world and your whole life is crashing down.

You know what I mean? If someone is trying to use a check I have to ask for help. I struggle every day at work. But I still like it. I'm not very good at the computer. I can't type really fast.

      "Hannah Richardson was a sophomore in college when we met on the Washington University campus in St. Louis. I had previously interviewed and photographed her uncle Bryan (forty-one) and her mother Carrie (thirty-nine).",
      "I asked Hannah about her family and her journey as a young Alzheimer's advocate and now college student. Because Hannah was so young when her mom Carrie was first diagnosed, she had to face the stigma and stereotypes of people living with Alzheimer's very early.",
      "She told me, \"I've had multiple people in my life tell me that my mom is lying. I've had people, friends and classmates tell me that since my mom is so young, there's no way she could have Alzheimer's. To my face people have told me that, and it's so hard to deal with that. When that first happened, I was fourteen and my mom was already doing some advocacy work.",
      "\"I was just shocked that someone would even think that or say that to me. That pushed",
      "me to follow my mom and try to be more active in the advocacy realm and to educate people my age, I started volunteering with my mom, and I eventually started my own chapter of the Youth Movement Against Alzheimer's at my high school. It was really empowering and it kind of pushed me to want to do more advocacy- and education-type work.",
      "\"It was such a surprise to see how little people actually knew about it, even into college.\" I asked Hannah to tell me about her mother and how she copes, and she told me, \"There have been moments where I feel so devastated and defeated by it that it literally breaks me down.",
      "\"My therapist said, 'It's like grief, like you've lost someone, but you haven't lost them yet, but you know it's coming.' To me, I feel that's even harder, because you're waiting, and also my mom has been asymptomatic.",
      "\"I don't think she's asymptomatic now. She still does. But in the last few years, I've started to see those little signs, and those little, subtle changes slowly happen. It was reality hitting me in the face.\"",
      "I asked, \"What are the little signs that you've been noticing, because your mother and your uncle Bryan present very differently?\"",
      "Hannah said, \"They definitely do. My mom was asymptomatic until probably about two years ago. She still tells people she's asymptomatic, because no doctor's told her she's neurologically symptomatic. She's not forgetting things. She's not having the same things my uncle is experiencing, but I still think she is, because behaviorally she's not the same person she was. When I was growing up, my mom loved to be very social. She was always around her friends. She played tennis. She had all these different friend groups that she spent time with. She cared a lot about her friends, and now she has no friends. She does not see anybody.",
      "\"Going to the store stresses her out. Me FaceTiming her on the phone gives her so much stress, and she gets overwhelmed by it. Any type of social interaction, if it's more than just someone talking to her in the kitchen, it's overwhelming to her, and she gets agitated and frustrated and just lashes out.",
      "\"Three or four years ago, that was not the case. If you try to bring that up to her, she's in full denial of it. It's really hard, because she's definitely interacting with other people very differently than she used to.",
      "\"When I go home and when I talk to her on the phone and I see these things, it's definitely really hard, because it's like my mom isn't who my mom used to be, and she doesn't even realize it or acknowledge it. I think that makes it even harder, because if you try to bring it up to her, she denies it and thinks that I'm just pulling it out of thin air, but I'm not, and other people see it too. It makes it a lot harder to acknowledge and deal with it. I think her way of coping is not acknowledging it and not grieving it or being upset about it and just not even trying to think about it happening.",
      "\"That's been hard, because I think that was part of why I didn't face reality for so long, because she just tried to help others and didn't act like it affected her. But it does. And it affects her and my siblings. I think it made it a harder journey in that sense, and I wish that she would acknowledge it more. I don't know how to change that, but it definitely makes it harder. I get sad about it and I get anxious about it. I worry for my future because I know that I have a 50 percent chance of having Alzheimer's. I don't want to lose her and lose my siblings. I don't want to die!",
      "\"I get anxious and sad, and I've never heard her talk about that. I've had to kind of cope with those emotions and go through that in my own way, because she wasn't there. I didn't see how she did it, and I didn't see how she was doing as something to relate to.\"",
      "I asked Hannah, \"How did your family's history with Alzheimer's influence your decision to study medicine?\"",
      "\"I saw how in the beginning my mom didn't just shut down when she got her diagnosis but",
      "tried to be active in the community and try to educate others. That was really inspiring to me, because she didn't just sit down and take it. I want to do that as well, because my mom's always been someone I've looked up to my entire life, and I just admire her strength.",
      "\"When I was in high school, I started going with my mom to her yearly visits at WashU and",
      "seeing what the doctors do. I told them I was really interested in science, and they'd let me go in during some of her scans. They'd tell me about the brain and stuff. It was really cool, and I really enjoyed it. These people are doing work that actually impacts people's lives, and that's something that I really want to do. I got really inspired and thought 'I want to go to WashU. I want to go into research. I want to do what these doctors are doing and help people.' I just focused on that a lot. It's also a way to cope with what my family is going through. I can do this, and it will help, and that will be something I can be doing that's proactive to help my family and other families and everyone in the Alzheimer's and dementia community.",
      "\"I think my wish is like everybody else's \u2014 I want there to be a cure or treatment, because it terrifies me to think that I could have this. It's the scariest thing I can think of, and I don't want it. All I can hope is that there's something that someone somewhere can figure out to stop this and stop people from dying from it. Stop people from having to go through it, and watching their loved ones go through it. Because I sure as hell don't want to watch my mom go through it, or my uncle, and I don't want to watch me go through it or my siblings. Knowing there's nothing right now, you just feel so hopeless and helpless. I think that's part of the reason why I want to go into research, because I don't want to feel helpless and hopeless. That is what scares me most in the entire world.\"",

      "The veterans who fought and defeated fascism during World War II, and those who supported the war effort on the home front, have been called \"The Greatest Generation.\" But David Nasaw, professor of history at the City University of New York, says that description may be misleading. His new book, titled \"The Wounded Generation\" (Penguin Press), examines the invisible psychic wounds experienced by service members that went undiagnosed or ill-treated, as they returned to a nation that had also changed following years of war.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Lesley Stahl's interview with David Nasaw on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 9!",
      "\"The Wounded Generation\" by David Nasaw",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Introduction",
      "In its duration, geographical reach, and ferocity, World War II was unprecedented, and the effects on those who fought it and their loved ones at home, immeasurable. The veterans who returned home were not the ones who had left for war. \"They are very different now,\" wrote the GI cartoonist Bill Mauldin in Up Front, published in June 1945. \"Don't let anybody tell you they aren't. ... Some say the American soldier is the same clean-cut young man who left his home. \u2026 They are wrong.\"",
      "Most returning veterans found it difficult, if not impossible, to get a full night's sleep. Many were troubled by recurring nightmares and flashbacks. They were irritable, angry, plagued by uncontrollable rages, feelings of social isolation, and fears of places and events that evoked memories of the war, their proximity to death, and the dead left behind. Large numbers sought relief by drinking to excess, as they had during the war and while awaiting repatriation. Those who sought professional help were told that they suffered from nothing more than battle fatigue that time would cure. It did not. The true cause of their distress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), would go undiagnosed and untreated for decades to come.",
      "Nearly 16.4 million Americans, 12 percent of the total population, 32 percent of males between eighteen and forty-five, served in the armed forces of the United States in World War II. They left behind four million spouses, two million children, and tens of millions of parents, siblings, lovers, friends, and neighbors. The book that follows is an account of the aftereffects that lived on in the bodies, hearts, and minds of those who fought, those who awaited their return, and the nation that had won the war but had now to readjust to peace.",
      "The war itself lasted nearly four years. The men and women who fought it on two oceans, in the air, and on the landmasses of Africa, Alaska, Asia, Europe, and the islands of the Pacific served an average of thirty-three months, three-quarters of them overseas for sixteen months on average, three times as long as their counterparts in World War I. Never before or since have so many been called away to war \u2014 and for so long.",
      "The brutality and carnage of a global war were brought home in graphic reports and visual images in the daily press, the weeklies, Hollywood films, and newsreels. The human costs were made manifest with the arrival stateside of troopships bearing cargoes of servicemen of no further use to the military. In 1943 alone, more than one million were sent home, half of them with disability discharges. The overall numbers were alarming, but more so the percentage of those disabled and discharged \u2014 40 percent for the army \u2014 with \"neuropsychiatric defects.\"",
      "Why had so many hale and hearty young men broken down? In 1948, three years after the cessation of hostilities, Dr. William Menninger, chief consultant in neuropsychiatry to the army surgeon general, explained that the higher incidence of psychological breakdowns in World War II as compared with World War I was due in large part to the fact that the second world war was \"a 'tougher' one as nearly three times as long; it was fought on a rapidly moving and shifting basis instead of on fixed lines; it required many amphibious landings; it was fought in every extreme of climate; the lethal devices were far more devastating and nerve-racking than ever before; and more men were kept away from home for longer periods.\"",
      "There was a great deal of truth in Menninger's analysis, but his explanation brought neither solace nor relief to those who returned home with PTSD symptoms that could not be treated because they were not understood \u2014 by the veterans, their families, and the doctors and psychiatrists from whom they sought help.",
      "The nation to which the veterans returned was not the one they had left behind. There were shortages of every conceivable consumer item: white shirts and men's suits; meat and maple syrup; beef, bread, and barley; cars, used and new; and, most critically, affordable housing. What was most troubling was the lingering, inescapable fear that a return to economic depression was just around the corner, that the layoff of millions of war workers and the discharge of millions more servicemen would lead to massive unemployment.",

    "summary": "Washington University Medicine in St. Louis is conducting important research into treating early-onset Alzheimer's before symptoms arise.",
    "story": [
      "\"I just know that my brain's not right,\" said Carrie Richardson, 44. \"And so, I hate it. I just want it to be normal.\"",
      "At 41, Carrie developed early-onset Alzheimer's disease. The condition is caused by rare genetic mutations that essentially guarantee a person will develop the disease. Her mother, Mary Salter, of Montgomery, Alabama, knows the toll of the disease all too well. \"I've lost seven family members from the ages of 37 to 44,\" she said \u2026 including her son, Bryan, who died last year.",
      "Mary, Carrie, and Carrie's daughter Hannah have been coming to the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis to participate in some of the world's first clinical trials in Alzheimer's prevention. \"It's the least I can do to help,\" said Hannah. \"I feel like I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do it.\"",
      "Dr. Randy Bateman, who leads international clinical trials at WashU Medicine, said, \"Now we have a chance to change the course of the disease in a way we've never been able to do before.\"",
      "One reason for Bateman's optimism: For the first time, there's finally success treating mild Alzheimer's with medication that removes amyloid plaques \u2013 the protein deposits that build up on the outside of nerve cells in the brain, interfering with memory and thinking. These drugs have been shown to slow cognitive decline.",
      "\"People who had the plaques removed are 30 percent better than the people who didn't have the plaques removed,\" Bateman said. \"It doesn't stop the dementia. Dementia still continues, but at a slower rate.\"",
      "The point of the trials, Bateman said, is to study what happens when treatment is started even before Alzheimer's symptoms are evident: \"If you look at the people who are treated in these trials, the people who are at the earlier stages, the earlier stage you go, the better off they do. Some of them actually have been stable. And so, what this suggests is that timing is critically important.\"",
      "Within a particular family with early-onset Alzheimer's, symptoms usually start at about the same age, so researchers can figure out when to start treatment to try to prevent the disease. \"In these people, we have near-100-percent certainty they will get Alzheimer's disease dementia,\" Bateman said. \"And we know about when they're going to get it.\"",
      "Though these rare mutations account for less than one percent of Alzheimer's patients, the lessons learned about when to start treatment may apply to everyone.",
      "\"A death sentence\"",
      "Jake Heinrichs is a Broadway theater electrician from Brooklyn who carries one of the early-onset genes. The disease claimed his grandmother, uncle, father and brother, all within the same age range. \"Symptoms in the 40s and, and dying in 50s,\" he said.",
      "For Heinrichs growing up, the word Alzheimer's was \"a death sentence.\"",
      "He started getting treatment in Bateman's study in 2013. Though he's definitely getting an antibody called lecanemab now, for the first seven years, he did not know if he was receiving an antibody or placebo. \"I was at an age where I should have been showing signs,\" Heinrichs said, \"and I am now at an age that I should probably not even be alive.\"",
      "His wife is Broadway director Rachel Chavkin. She says over the past three years, he will occasionally repeat a question, but otherwise has shown no cognitive decline since she fell in love with him twenty years ago. \"Jake is now 51, which is the age that his father was when he died,\" she said.",
      "The Trump administration's budget cuts have stopped or delayed millions of dollars in Alzheimer's research. The situation has already had an impact on Bateman's trials. \"It's a precarious time,\" he said. \"Research is not like building a building or painting a wall where you can start and then stop for a few years and then go back and resume what you were doing. It's much more like feeding a baby \u2026 if you stop doing that for a few weeks, it's irrecoverable.\"",
      "\"Let's double-down on this disease\"",
      "With federal research money threatened, philanthropist Bill Gates says the effect of decreasing investment delays any breakthrough. \"The data these young researchers have to consider different ideas is so much better than even five years ago,\" he said. \"So, this is the time where you think, wow, let's double-down on this disease.\"",
      "That's exactly what Gates is doing. The billionaire Microsoft co-founder is using his wealth and influence to bring together industry and government to tackle Alzheimer's. He's already personally invested more than $300 million. \"I'm going to stay very involved in this,\" he said.",
      "At a time of such possibility, uncertainty about funding is threatening momentum. \"It's quite up in the air,\" Gates said. \"If you talk to researchers, they're dealing with the uncertainty of, should they hire young people, or buy new equipment? And so, hopefully in the next several months, this gets resolved and, you know, that we can go full speed ahead.\"",
      "Gates has spent a considerable amount of his fortune to improve public health. And for him, it so happens Alzheimer's is personal. Bill Gates Sr., an attorney and philanthropist who died five years ago at the age of 94, also had Alzheimer's. \"He was lucky enough to have 24-hour care,\" said Gates. \"But there was no medicine, no, nothing that could bring his cognition back.\"",
      "Gates is supporting research to improve early diagnosis, treatment, and patient enrollment in trials. And \u2013 surprise \u2013 he sees a huge role for artificial intelligence. \"AI is going to impact everything we do,\" he said. \"The biology of the brain is so complex that AI's ability to take large amounts of data and find meaning in that data means that this research is going to go a lot faster.\"",
      "The early-onset clinical trials are expected to continue for at least another five years involving hundreds of people at 40 sites around the world. If successful, it could usher in routine screening for Alzheimer's with a simple blood test, just as we do now for high cholesterol and diabetes.",
      "Could people be tested now? Bateman said, \"Right now in medicine, we don't test people without symptoms, because the treatments aren't yet proven to work in people without symptoms.\"",
      "Finding effective treatments is a hot area of research, and may include giving cocktails of medications that target not only amyloid but other possible culprits, such as brain inflammation and a damaging nerve cell protein called tau.",
      "Bateman said, \"If this trial holds up and we can continue to demonstrate benefit year-after-year that these people are protected, then I actually think that will predict what's gonna happen in the near future in ongoing prevention trials: That they will be positive, they will work, they will give people years of dementia-free life.\"",
      "So, Jake Heinrichs undergoes regular MRIs, physicals, memory testing, spinal taps, and PET scans to monitor his brain function, and see if he can prevent an almost-certain genetic destiny.",
      "Four-year-old Sam Heinrichs is living proof of what can come from a belief in science \u2013 and a leap of faith.",
      "I asked Jake, \"What made you finally say, you know what, even though there's a 50-percent chance he might get the gene, we're going to go ahead and try to have a baby?\"",
      "\"Because I've been part of this study, and it seems to be effective,\" Jake replied. \"It gave me hope that the scourge of Alzheimer's is something that we're not going to fear in the future. Anything could happen. But right now, I have hope.\"",

      "It's still unclear when the shutdown might end, though the Senate is working to finalize a funding package. House members were told late Sunday to expect votes on government funding this week, pending final passage of the funding measure in the Senate.",
      "Once a funding bill passes and the government reopens, federal workers are\u00a0entitled to back pay\u00a0under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law covers both furloughed employees and those required to work without pay, requiring agencies to issue retroactive payments as soon as possible rather than waiting for scheduled pay dates.",
      "As the shutdown stretches on, the financial toll on federal workers has deepened, with some turning to\u00a0bank loans to cover bills. About 1.4 million employees\u00a0missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",
      "The Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military personnel, said it has seen a surge in interest for its no-interest loans since the shutdown began.",
      "\"More than 350,000 members enrolled for assistance \u2014 18 times the enrollment in the 2018-19 shutdown,\" said Heather Long, the credit union's chief economist, in an email. \"It's one of many signs of how painful and uncertain this shutdown has been for many hard-working families.\"",
      "When will workers be paid?",
      "Under the 2019 law, workers who miss paychecks during a lapse in federal funding must be paid retroactively as soon as the shutdown ends. It directs agencies to issue back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "That's what happened after the 2018\u201319 shutdown, said Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.",
      "\"In prior shutdowns, back pay has been paid at the earliest date possible after appropriations have been passed, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" she told CBS News. \"At this time, we have every indication that this would move forward.\"",
      "At least 670,000 federal employees are currently furloughed, while roughly 730,000 are working without pay throughout the shutdown, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. If the shutdown lasts through December 1, the group estimates about 4.5 million paychecks \u2014 totaling $21 billion \u2014 would be delayed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-50-year-mortgage-loan-bill-pulte-cost/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:41:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable? The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan.",
      "Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "The proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 14:40:40 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",
      "A White House official said that \"the economists making that assertion are baselessly speculating\" about a possible inflationary impact, noting that there aren't many details yet about the plan.",

    "story": [
      "The Federal Aviation Administration on Saturday ordered MD-11 and MD-11F aircrafts to be grounded as authorities investigate the deadly UPS plane crash in Kentucky.",
      "The emergency airworthiness directive came after UPS and FedEx said they are voluntarily grounding their fleets of McDonnell Douglas MD-11 cargo planes \"out of an abundance of caution\" following a deadly crash at the UPS global aviation hub in Louisville.",
      "The FAA's order was issued \"because the agency has determined the unsafe condition is likely to exist or develop in other products of the same type design,\" the document obtained by CBS News read.",
      "\"We are assessing any potential safety issues and will ensure appropriate corrective actions are taken,\" the agency said in a statement.",
      "The crash on Tuesday at UPS Worldport killed 14 people, including the three pilots on the MD-11 that was headed for Honolulu. National Transportation Safety Board official Todd Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane\u00a0was a\u00a01991 McDonnell Douglas 2 that had been \"altered\" into a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 Freighter.",
      "MD-11 aircrafts make up about 9% of of the UPS airline fleet and 4% of the FedEx fleet, the companies said.",
      "\"We made this decision proactively at the recommendation of the aircraft manufacturer,\" a UPS statement said late Friday. \"Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our employees and the communities we serve.\"",
      "FedEx said in an email that it will be grounding the aircrafts while it conducts \"a thorough safety review based on the recommendation of the manufacturer.\"",
      "The planes were built by McDonnell Douglas, but the company merged with Boeing in 1997, making Boeing the manufacturer of record for the aircraft. Boeing told CBS News in a statement that it made the recommendation to ground the aircraft \"out of an abundance of caution.\"",
      "Boeing's Safety Review Board assessed all available information about the crash and determined that further engineering analysis was needed, a company spokesperson told CBS News via email. The manufacturer recommended pausing fleet operations while that analysis was conducted. Inman said Thursday that the crashed plane was currently being \"handled\" by Boeing.",
      "Boeing announced in 1998 that it would be phasing out its MD-11 jetliner production, with final deliveries due in 2000. There are about 70 MD-11 planes in operation today. The planes are only used to ferry cargo. FedEx and UPS each have about two dozen MD-11s, and a third airline, Western Global, has 16. Twelve of those planes were already put in storage, according to the aviation analytics firm Cirium. CBS News reached out to Western Global for comment on the grounding.",
      "Flight records suggest the UPS MD-11 that crashed underwent maintenance while it was on the ground in San Antonio, Texas, for more than a month until mid-October. It is not clear what work was done.",
      "The UPS cargo plane was nearly airborne Tuesday when a bell sounded in the cockpit, Inman said during a briefing Friday. For the next 25 seconds, the bell rang and the pilots tried to control the aircraft as it barely lifted off the runway, its left wing ablaze and missing an engine, and then plowed into the ground in a spectacular fireball. The plane was carrying about 255,000 pounds of jet fuel, as well as up to 20,000 packages.",
      "The cockpit voice recorder captured the bell, which sounded about 37 seconds after the crew called for takeoff thrust, Inman said. There are different types of alarms with varying meanings, he said, and investigators haven't determined why the bell rang, though they know the left wing was burning and the engine on that side had detached.",
      "Inman said it would be months before a transcript of the cockpit recording is made public as part of that investigation process.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former federal crash investigator, said the bell likely was signaling the engine fire.",
      "\"It occurred at a point in the takeoff where they were likely past their decision speed to abort the takeoff,\" Guzzetti told The Associated Press after Inman's news conference. \"They were likely past their critical decision speed to remain on the runway and stop safely. \u2026 They'll need to thoroughly investigate the options the crew may or may not have had.\"",
      "Dramatic video captured the aircraft crashing into businesses and erupting in a fireball. Footage from phones, cars and security cameras has given investigators evidence of what happened from many different angles. Witnesses recalled chaos on the ground.",
      "\"It was explosion after explosion after explosion, so you just didn't know when it was going to stop,\" Georgie Dow, the chief financial officer of an auto parts business that was struck by the plane, told CBS News. \"It was so hot ... You took a step back because it was like heat in your face. There was no going to help.\"",
      "The UPS package handling facility in Louisville is the company's largest. The hub employs more than 20,000 people in the region, handles 300 flights daily and sorts more than 400,000 packages an hour.",
      "UPS Worldport operations resumed Wednesday night with its Next Day Air, or night sort, operation, spokesperson Jim Mayer said.",

      "The group's hiring expectations \"reflect the softening and slowing labor market,\" NRF chief economist Mark Mathews said in a Thursday press briefing.",
      "\"But nevertheless, we are confident that retailers will be prepared to meet consumers with the prices, with the goods, and the convenient savings and value they're looking for this holiday season,\" he added.",
      "Despite\u00a0diminished consumer sentiment, holiday spending is projected to hold up as shoppers continue to prioritize the season's celebrations over other purchases, he said.",
      "\"People save for it, they plan for it, they prioritize it and we think that's going to happen again this year,\" Mathews noted.",
      "To be sure, consumers are expressing concern about rising prices, with inflation ticking higher in recent months due partly to wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Retailers are handing some of those tariff costs to shoppers, with a Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis analysis finding that companies\u00a0passed\u00a0about one-third of the new import duties onto consumers from May through July.",
      "\"All signals are consumers continue to be concerned about inflation and rising prices,\" NRF senior economist Jack Kleinhenz said during the press briefing. \"Despite these concerns, I believe consumers are still willing to spend, even though their sentiment is at very low levels.\"",
      "While retailers are planning fewer seasonal hires this year, some have added additional staff in the past few years, which could help compensate, NRF economists added.",
      "\"You might see less hiring, but we are seeing less firing in the retail industry,\" Matthews said. \"Those two are running neck and neck.\"",
      "For example, Target said it's asking current retail employees if they want to pick up additional shifts during the holidays before adding new seasonal hires.",

    "published": "Fri, 07 Nov 2025 15:00:23 -0500",
    "summary": "Estimates of the economic hit from the U.S. government shutdown put the losses at up to $16 billion every week the impasse continues.",
    "story": [
      "With bipartisan congressional talks to end the U.S. government shutdown bogging down on Friday, the hit to the national economy is growing, experts said.",
      "\"Even if there is a reopening of the government in the next couple of weeks, you're going to see a visible and permanent loss of economic activity as a result of the government shutdown,\" Greg Daco, chief economist at consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS News.",
      "Estimates of the economic impact range from $7 billion to $16 billion per week, with the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, a U.S. government agency, forecasting a weekly loss of $15 billion. A recent CBS News\u00a0poll\u00a0found that 54% of Americans said they are \"very concerned\" about how the shutdown is affecting the economy.",
      "Here's where the shutdown, now on Day 38, is hitting the economy hardest.",
      "Federal workers",
      "Hundreds of thousands of government employees are going without pay during the shutdown, forcing many to take out loans or seek out temporary jobs to make ends meet.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank,\u00a0estimates that at least 670,000 federal workers are furloughed and roughly 730,000 are working without pay.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan federal agency that provides analysis to lawmakers, said in a\u00a0letter\u00a0last month that the reduction in hours worked by furloughed federal employees alone could end up costing the economy $14 billion by year-end if the shutdown stretches to Thanksgiving.",
      "Although government workers are expected to receive back pay\u00a0once the stalemate ends, some employees are likely to start to pull back on spending, which could ripple through the economy, said Mark Zandi,\u00a0chief economist at financial research firm Moody's Analytics.",
      "Consumers",
      "The interruption in food-stamp benefits during the shutdown for the more than 40 million Americans enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is also temporarily sapping consumer spending, Zandi said.",
      "Spending could soon rebound after a federal judge\u00a0ordered\u00a0the Trump administration to provide full federal benefits to states by Friday. Still, the suspension of food stamps comes as many low- and middle-income Americans face other financial strains, including a spike in Affordable Care Act health insurance rates.",
      "\"There's all kinds of funding that's not getting paid out, and that will impact the ability and willingness of these households to spend,\" Zandi said.",
      "Small businesses",
      "One key sector of the economy feeling the pinch is small businesses, many of which rely on government loans and business from federal agencies to stay afloat.",
      "For example, the shutdown is preventing the Small Business Administration from distributing $170 million in federally guaranteed loans per day to hundreds of smaller employers, an agency spokesperson told CBS News. As of Wednesday, that amounted to a total loss of $4.5 billion in capital for more than 8,300 small businesses, according to SBA.",
      "Federal contractors",
      "The government employs millions of contract workers in custodial, information technology and other roles. However, that activity has stopped during the shutdown, depriving many private businesses of revenue.",
      "Grace Zwemmer, an associate economist at Oxford Economics, said the investment advisory firm estimates that roughly $800 million in federal awards are at risk of disruption each week the shutdown drags on. Around 5.2 million federal contractor workers stand to be impacted, according to unofficial estimates, she added.",
      "\"A prolonged shutdown could significantly impact these individuals by impacting the cash flow for the contractors, potentially leading to furloughs, pay cuts or layoffs, with the risks greater for small business contractors,\" Zwemmer said.",
      "An Oxford Economics report this week noted that recent jobless claims data point to a rise in private-sector layoffs in states most exposed to the shutdown.",
      "Travel companies",
      "The travel industry is feeling the impact after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to cut thousands of flights across the U.S. starting Friday.",
      "As of Wednesday, the industry had already lost roughly $5 billion in travel spending, according to Erik Hansen, head of government relations at the U.S. Travel Association.",
      "\"The timing couldn't be worse-just weeks before the busiest travel period of the year,\" he said.",
      "Economic growth",
      "Overall, the government shutdown is expected to take a toll on U.S. gross domestic product, the total output of goods and services.",
      "The CBO estimates that the drag on economic activity from the government closure will reduce annualized GDP growth in the final three months of the year by 1 to 2 percentage points, depending on how long the shutdown lasts.",
      "While economists expect most of the decline in growth to be recovered when the government reopens and as spending and commercial activity ramp back up, the CBO forecasts a permanent economic loss of $7 billion to $14 billion. Still, that is a tiny fraction of the $30 trillion economy.",

      "Facing a shortage of air traffic controllers, data shows flight delays are on the rise as the government shutdown drags on. It's a trend that is expected to continue as federal officials plan to cut travel by 10% at 40 airports starting Friday.",
      "Nearly a quarter of flights arrived late into 16 of America's busiest airports in the week after air traffic controllers missed their first paycheck on Oct. 28, according to a CBS News analysis of data from aviation company Cirium. That's compared with 18% of flights arriving late in September.",

      "More air traffic controllers have not been coming to work during the shutdown, with some opting to take on second jobs to make up for lost pay.

That doesn't include staffing delays at control towers not based at airports, which also manage air traffic.",
      "Before the decision to cut air travel by 10%, Duffy had warned delays and cancellations would get worse if the shutdown continued, and cautioned the FAA would consider closing some airspace.",

    "summary": "Travel pros are urging people to brace for flight disruptions as the FAA throttles back air traffic starting on Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Airlines and travel experts are warning that a move by federal authorities to throttle back the number of flights at 40 major airports starting on Friday could disrupt people's travel plans across the U.S.",
      "\"Even if you're flying out of an airport that doesn't have reductions, there will be a domino effect across the entire system,\" said aviation expert Julian Kheel, CEO of travel booking site Points Path, adding that passengers should prepare for \"significant flight disruptions.\"",
      "One airline chief executive urged customers to buy a second ticket from another airline in case one flight is scrapped \u2014 a workaround that some travelers could see as beyond their means.",
      "\"If you are headed to a wedding, funeral or something you must be somewhere for in the next few days \u2014 given the risk of flights [canceling] I would suggest passengers buy a backup ticket on another carrier that departs after the first ticket,\" Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said in an Instagram post on Thursday.",
      "\"Carriers like Frontier will be putting you on the next available flight but that may not be until after your event due to the scale of this disruption,\" he added.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on Wednesday announced that air traffic in 40 \"high-volume\" airports would be reduced by 10% in the coming days to cope with shortages of air traffic controllers, who are working without pay amid the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "The flight restrictions are expected to be phased in starting Friday, with airlines reaching the full 10% mark by next week, two sources familiar with discussions between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and the airlines told CBS News.",
      "Some airports on the FAA's list for capacity cuts are already experiencing problems. Passengers flying out of Boston's\u00a0Logan Airport\u00a0on Thursday were starting to see flight delays and cancellations due to the shutdown, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Airlines promise extra help \u2014 and refunds",
      "As the air capacity cuts loomed, major airlines vowed on Thursday to alert customers on flight issues, help people rebook their travel, and provide refunds or credit if their trips are disrupted.",
      "\"As schedule changes are made, we'll proactively reach out to customers who are impacted,\" American Airlines said in a statement to CBS News.",
      "The carrier also said that customers whose flights are canceled for any reason or who choose not to travel can change their flight or request a refund without penalty. American encouraged customers to stay up-to-date on their flight's status using its mobile app.",
      "The airline said that, from Nov. 7 to Nov. 10, it will trim its flight schedules by 4% at the 40 airports affected by the FAA capacity restrictions, the equivalent of about 220 flights canceled each day. That represents a small fraction of the 6,000 daily flights on those days, American noted.",
      "Southwest Airlines said it will notify customers if their flight is canceled and automatically rebook them on new flights. Customers who do not wish to be rebooked are eligible for refunds, provided they cancel a new itinerary arranged by Southwest at least 10 minutes before the new flight's departure, the airline told CBS News.",
      "Delta Air Lines also said it would allow customers to cancel flights without penalty between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9.",
      "Check before you head to the airport",
      "Tiffany Funk, co-founder of travel rewards site point.me, said travelers should be extra vigilant in monitoring communications from their airline before heading to the airport. \"Pay attention to updates from airlines. If you're not getting emails, call them.\"",
      "John Rose, chief risk and security officer at Altour, a travel management company, recommended that travelers use an airline's app to track inbound flights to anticipate any delays.",
      "\"The main thing to watch is that the flight is still going, that it's on time. That's a trick that's easy to do on the airline's app. See where your plane is coming from and if it has any problems,\" he told CBS News.",
      "Rose added that it's important to look beyond the airports where cuts are implemented for travel disruptions, given that shortages of air traffic controllers in airport towers could affect airspace outside of such regions.",
      "\"Recognize that even with the 10% cutback, other flights could be impacted beyond that, because we don't know where people are going to be calling in sick and having staffing shortages,\" he said.",
      "But don't check luggage",
      "Although travelers should avoid checking luggage, if possible, to minimize another potential hitch, Rose recommends packing essentials like medication and a change of clothes.",
      "\"Plan to be stuck somewhere for an extra day,\" he said.",
      "He noted that international flights might be less prone to disruptions, given that airlines typically operate fewer flights a day to foreign destinations.",
      "\"Historically, the last flights to cancel are international because they tend to only fly there once or twice a day, and if they put you on the next flight, it's in a day or two,\" he said.",
      "When to book a backup fare",
      "Travelers who are especially eager to avoid flight problems can get a backup ticket, Funk said.",
      "\"If you have critical travel you cannot miss, then another ticket on a different carrier is always a good play,\" she said. \"Every carrier will solve for these things differently, so get a ticket on another airline even if there's a connection.\"",
      "Unused tickets can be canceled within 24 hours of purchase, she noted, so it's a relatively risk-free move.",
      "\"If I had a trip scheduled in the next week that I didn't have to take, I would consider rescheduling it,\" said Kheel of Points Path. \"If you do have to take a trip, you can book multiple flights on different airlines to try and protect yourself.\"",
      "Despite the headaches for passengers, air travel remains safe during the closure of federal agencies, now on Day 37 and the longest\u00a0government shutdown in U.S. history, Rose added.",
      "\"People's safety is not being compromised. The FAA is not going to put travelers in a higher-risk situation because of this,\" he said.",

    "summary": "The vote comes after a top shareholder, Norway's sovereign wealth fund, said it would vote against the pay package.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a\u00a0new pay package\u00a0for CEO Elon Musk that is potentially worth up to $1 trillion over a decade, despite some prominent investors criticizing the size of the compensation plan.",
      "The plan, one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history, would be delivered to Musk \u2014 the richest person in the world, with a net worth of $437 billion \u2014 if Tesla hits certain performance goals under his leadership. Meeting such targets would make him the world's first trillionaire.",
      "Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package, while investment advisory firms Glass Lewis and ISS also recommended shareholders vote against it.",
      "The vote comes at a delicate time for Tesla, with the electric car maker's sales tumbling earlier this year after Musk spearheaded the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. His role overseeing the layoffs of thousands of government workers antagonized some consumers, with Yale University researchers saying Muks's actions\u00a0reduced Tesla's sales by as many as 1.2 million vehicles over the past three years.",
      "Musk stepped back from DOGE in May, promising to refocus on Tesla.",
      "One prominent Wall Street analyst, Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities, said the generous pay package is necessary to ensure Musk remains committed to Tesla.",
      "\"Tesla's board members have asked shareholders to approve a long-term incentive package for Musk to retain and motivate the CEO to remain in his current leadership role with a new share package where he will only be paid if he attains 'extraordinary financial returns,'\" Ives said in a Nov. 5 research note.",
      "The package requires Tesla to hit certain milestones, such as reaching a market cap of $8.5 trillion, or about six times its current valuation of $1.4 trillion, shipping 20 million vehicles and delivering 1 million of Tesla's humanoid \"Optimus\" robots.",
      "Despite Musk's controversial leadership, the company's sales and stock price have soared over the years. Since it went public in June 2010, the company's stock has returned almost 35,000%, compared with a roughly 550% gain in the S&P 500 over the same time period.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 15:54:19 -0500",
    "summary": "Trade experts expect some U.S. tariffs to remain elevated even if the Supreme Court strikes down President Trump's IEEPA levies.",
    "story": [
      "High tariffs on America's trading partners are likely to remain in place even if the Supreme Court rules that President Trump improperly invoked federal emergency powers to impose the levies, according to trade experts.",
      "In a hearing on Wednesday, several of the high court justices appeared skeptical of Mr. Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to implement sweeping tariffs on nearly every country. Trump administration officials say the policies are needed to reduce the nation's trade deficit and spur\u00a0domestic manufacturing.",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of the global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice at law firm Sidley Austin, said Mr. Trump is unlikely to abandon tariffs, noting that the president has other legal tools at his disposal to maintain sharply higher duties on imports.",
      "\"Our view is that even if the Supreme Court were to strike down the IEEPA tariffs going forward, the result won't be any different,\" Murphy said. \"The U.S. will be living in a higher tariff rate environment going forward \u2014 it just might be under different tariff authorities.\"",
      "Other statutes the Trump administration could lean on to impose broad tariffs instead of IEEPA include Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the president to impose duties on trade partners to protect national security. Mr. Trump could also draw on Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, under which the Department of Commerce would need to investigate whether foreign trade partners engage in any unfair trade practices.",
      "Still, a Supreme Court ruling against Mr. Trump would represent a blow to his economic agenda. Murphy noted that the process for implementing Section 232 and 301 tariffs, which Mr. Trump applied to imports such as steel and aluminum during his first term as president, is more limiting and cumbersome than the broad authority granted under IEEPA.",
      "\"Section 232 and 301 are the most obvious directions for the administration to turn, but they'd likely take months to conclude, rather than weeks,\" added Patrick Childress, an international trade attorney at Holland & Knight.",
      "Potential tariff refunds",
      "An adverse ruling for Mr. Trump could require the U.S. government to offer billions of dollars in refunds to businesses. Through August, importers had paid a total of nearly $89 billion in IEEPA tariffs, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.",
      "Said Rick Woldenberg, CEO of toy company Learning Resources, a plaintiff in the IEEPA case before the Supreme Court, \"I definitely want my money back,\" adding that the \"government has chosen to hit us with a massive tax.\"",
      "The U.S. has an average\u00a0tariff rate of 18%, the highest tax on foreign goods since 1934, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Although a ruling against Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA could lead to a refund for businesses, it could also sow more uncertainty, Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS News.",
      "\"It would be unlikely to significantly alter where we see tariffs ending up in our forecast, and the economic implications,\" she said. \"It is only going to lead to heightened uncertainty regarding trade policy, so it might have a lagged impact on hiring and business investment, similar to what we saw earlier this year.\"",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment on whether Mr. Trump would turn to other laws as an avenue for imposing tariffs if the Supreme Court rules against him on using IEEPA.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Wednesday told Fox Business that he's optimistic that the court will rule in Mr. Trump's favor.",
      "\"I'm confident that the President's emergency powers\u2026we did have emergencies, the President has dealt with them. He's continuing to deal with them,\" he said.",
      "Experts expect a ruling in the case early next year.",

    "summary": "The FAA will reduce U.S. air traffic by 10% at 40 U.S. locations starting on Friday due to the government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Federal officials announced that the U.S. will reduce air traffic by 10% across 40 \"high-volume\" markets starting on Friday, citing staffing shortages related to the ongoing\u00a0government shutdown.",
      "\"We have decided that a 10% reduction in scheduled capacity would be appropriate to continue to take the pressure off of our controllers,\" Federal Aviation Administration Administrator Bryan Bedford said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Bedford and U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the new measures are necessary to keep air travel safe, as pressures on air traffic controllers mount during the longest government shutdown in history.",
      "Bedford said he would specify which 40 markets around the country will be affected on Thursday, adding that the restrictions will affect commercial airspace and other activities, including space launches.",
      "A source late Wednesday night provided CBS News with a proposed list of the 40 markets that included major hubs such as Boston Logan International, New York LaGuardia, Los Angeles International and Dallas/Fort Worth International. The provided list was not final and could change.",
      "More air traffic controllers are exhibiting fatigue as they work without pay during the congressional stalemate, now in its 36th day, Bedford added. Thursday will mark one month since controllers were last paid.",
      "Airlines, aviation unions and the wider travel industry have urged Congress to end the shutdown.",
      "More than 10,000 flights within, into or out of the U.S. experienced delays last weekend, while roughly 11,000 trips have been delayed this week, according to tracking service FlightAware.",
      "The U.S. struggled to recruit sufficient numbers of air traffic controllers even before the shutdown began, with Duffy saying that the country needs an additional 2,000 controllers.",
      "Bedford and Duffy said they would consult later Wednesday with airline industry executives to discuss how to safely implement the reduction in flights.",
      "\"The early indicators are telling us we can take action today to prevent things from deteriorating,\" Bedford said.",
      "The cuts will likely be phased in beginning Friday, according to two sources familiar with the contents of a call held later Wednesday between the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Transportation and airline representatives.",
      "The airlines have yet to receive an official order from the FAA laying out the requirements of the capacity reduction, but are operating under the understanding they will need to reduce their schedules by at least 4% on Friday, at least 5% on Saturday and hit the 10% mark for next week in those 40 markets, the sources said. Since the FAA order has not been issued, this could still change.",
      "The two sources said the switch to a phased-in approach may come about out of concern that the request to slash complex airline schedules in 48 hours was going to be fraught with the potential of major disruptions for flyers.",
      "CBS News has reached out to DOT for comment on the details of the capacity reduction. When reached by CBS News, the FAA deferred to DOT.",
      "Several airline sources described to CBS News confusion over how the reduction will be applied, by what mechanism, and if it is going to be tied to actual staffing levels.",
      "The decision caught airlines by surprise, and they are now scrambling to make plans, the airline sources said.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, American Airlines said that it would operate \"as planned\" on Thursday, but that it was \"awaiting additional information from the FAA to determine which flights will be impacted\" on Friday, but that it expected \"the vast majority of our customers' travel will be unaffected.\"",
      "United Airlines said in a statement that it will update its schedule once the flight reductions begin so the carrier can notify customers of any changes \"several days\" in advance.",

    "published": "Thu, 06 Nov 2025 08:13:22 -0500",
    "summary": "A trend that started in the technology sector is spreading to other industries, with businesses cutting workers even as their profits expand.",
    "story": [
      "As U.S. corporate profits rise and the stock market hits new highs, investors are reaping the rewards. Yet beneath the surge, companies have cut nearly 1 million jobs this year \u2014 the most since 2020, when the pandemic slammed the economy.",
      "The disconnect between soaring company earnings and mounting layoffs amounts to what Chen Zhao, chief global strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, calls a \"jobless boom.\" Typically, layoffs accelerate when companies are struggling with declining profitability and need to pare costs.",
      "\"We've never seen anything like that\"",
      "\"This is something that is completely different from a historical playbook,\" Zhao told CBS News. \"It's kind of odd to see Amazon laying off 30,000 people even though the profit is doing really, really well.\"",
      "At the heart of the issue, Zhao said, is the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence, which is boosting business productivity across multiple industries and the economy at large, while also suppressing demand for workers. Although that trend has initially taken root in the technology sector, it is spreading to other industries as businesses adopt AI as a way to boost productivity and lower costs, he noted.",
      "\"You have a labor demand that basically has come down to probably 0% in terms of growth, maybe even a mild contraction, even though the economy is doing fine \u2014 profits are doing great,\" he said. \"We've never seen anything like that.\"",
      "For much of 2025, the job market was described by economists as\u00a0\"no hire, no fire,\"\u00a0meaning an environment where workers could count on job security even as hiring around the U.S. cooled. But conditions have changed, and the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate in both September and October, citing increasing risks to employment growth and with Fed Chair Jerome Powell noting that policymakers are closely watching layoff announcements by big employers.",
      "The Department of Labor's monthly employment report has been on hold since the government shutdown began on Oct. 1, which delayed September's labor market data and is likely to also postpone October's report. Still, economists are turning to other employment measures to assess the health of the labor market, such as data from payroll processor ADP.",
      "By those metrics, job growth looks muted. ADP, which only tracks private-sector hiring, said Wednesday that private employers added 42,000 workers in October, a modest rebound after two months of subpar hiring.",
      "\"Employment is stagnating in the fall, according to data available during the shutdown,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in an email. \"While private employment grew in October, overall employment was likely about flat in the month after accounting for federal layoffs, which aren't measured by ADP.\"",
      "Why unemployment isn't spiking",
      "The nation's unemployment rate has remained relatively low despite the shifting tides of slower hiring and more layoffs, experts have noted. The jobless rate stood at 4.3% in August, according to the most recent data available.",
      "Unemployment has remained in check because the nation's labor pool is shrinking due to the retiring baby boom generation and lower immigration stemming from the Trump administration's tighter policies, Zhao said.",
      "\"You basically have a labor demand that is going nowhere, and labor supply going nowhere, too,\" he said. \"So that creates a very odd equilibrium.\"",
      "Not everyone thinks AI is driving the recent bout of layoffs. Instead, the job cuts are more likely due to businesses recalibrating their needs after the pandemic, when many employers expanded and may have overhired, said Art Papas, the CEO of Bullhorn, a software company that works with recruitment and temporary agencies.",
      "Companies feel more emboldened to cut workers now because it's easier to find new talent than during the pandemic, when the labor market was tighter, he said. Papas also believes businesses that point to AI as a reason for layoffs are using it more as a buzzword.",
      "\"These companies announce layoffs and their stock goes up \u2014 it's a perverse incentive to announce layoffs,\" he noted.",
      "But the change in the labor market is very real, with companies cutting back on hiring for entry-level jobs, Papas said.",
      "\"People point to AI, and say, 'That's because AI is replacing entry-level jobs,'\" he said. \"I say, 'No, that's a sign companies aren't hiring, because companies do most of the hiring at the entry level'.\"",

      "The Food and Drug Administration said it was taking action after receiving reports of injuries in connection with the products, including what it said were symptoms of botulism.",
      "Botox is a diluted, purified form of botulinum, one of the most toxic substances in the world. The ingredient works by temporarily blocking nerve signals and causing muscles to relax. While most famously approved for cosmetic use, Botox is also approved in the U.S. for a number of medical conditions including muscle spasms, eye disorders and migraines.",
      "The FDA warning letters mostly went to cosmetics websites. In each case, the FDA said the companies were offering unofficial or mislabeled versions of Botox-like drugs that haven't been approved by the agency. In addition to the original drug, introduced by Allergan in 1989, the FDA has approved several competing versions.",
      "FDA-approved Botox drugs carry the agency's most serious warning, a boxed label alerting doctors and patients that the medications can cause serious or life-threatening side effects.",
      "In rare cases, the toxin can spread beyond the injection site to other parts of the body, paralyzing or weakening muscles needed for breathing and swallowing. Signs of botulism include difficulty swallowing or breathing, slurred speech and muscle weakness. Those symptoms can occur several hours after an injection.",

Thousands of union members weighed in, with an overwhelming majority \u2014 92% \u2014 voting in favor of the strike, according to the labor group.",
      "The union said if Starbucks doesn't deliver a contract in the next week, the strike would begin the same day as Starbucks' Red Cup Day, an annual event intended to drum up business for the coffee giant's holiday menu.",

      "Contract negotiations between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but have bogged down. The union is asking for increased hours for workers and higher take-home pay, among other demands.",
      "According to Anderson, the union has proposed an immediate pay increase of 65%, and 77% total over three years. The union spokesperson disputed that claim, saying the union had presented several separate wage proposals during negotiations, which Starbucks then combined as if they were a single request.",
      "The union has also asked for added pay if they work a shift within three hours of opening or closing, during a promotional event, or over the weekend, Anderson said.",
      "Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0recently told CBS News that he's open to talking with union members, but said that their demands \"to date have been unreasonable.\"",
      "\"We already give them the best job in retail. We have the lowest turnover in the industry \u2014 it's below 50%,\" he said. \"We also have the best benefits in the industry, and we actually have the best wages in the industry.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate took a major\u00a0step toward ending the government shutdown late Monday by passing a funding bill that unlocks a broader agreement on long-term spending and the promise of a future vote on extending health care tax credits.",
      "The vote was 60-40, with eight Democrats providing the votes needed. One Republican voted against it.",
      "The eight Democrats had been engaged in bipartisan talks over ending the stalemate for several weeks, and reached the agreement without the support of the party's leaders in the upper chamber. The House could vote on the bill as early as Wednesday, and if it passes, it will go to President Trump's desk.",
      "The agreement they struck does nothing to address the expiring health care tax credits \u2014 which had been their party's key demand \u2014 besides the promise of a future vote on the issue. The deal left many Democrats furious with the eight senators who voted to advance it and with the party's leaders for allowing the defections.",
      "Here's what is in the agreement:",
      "Government funding extension until Jan. 30",
      "The final deal will include a 31-page continuing resolution that extends current levels of government funding through January 2026 to give lawmakers more time to finalize full-year spending bills.",
      "The House passed a continuing resolution to extend funding until Nov. 21 in September, but until Sunday the Senate was unable to advance it. With that deadline less than two weeks away, Senate negotiators determined that they would need another extension to continue work on appropriations.",
      "Some senators had floated a December deadline in a new continuing resolution, but House Speaker Mike Johnson dismissed that possibility, since it would pressure lawmakers to approve new spending before the holidays.",
      "A future vote on health care tax credits",
      "As part of the deal, Senate Republicans agreed to hold a vote on the health care tax credits under the Affordable Care Act, which help millions of Americans purchase health insurance on state exchanges. The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and patients are facing eye-popping increases for their insurance premiums.",
      "Under the deal, a vote would be held by the end of the second week of December, and the Democrats would have final say on what is in the bill.",
      "But a Senate vote on the issue is likely to fail, since most GOP senators are opposed to the Affordable Care Act overall and the tax credits in particular.",
      "That fact explains why so many Democrats are angry over the agreement, since it does not include an extension of the credits and only promises a future vote. That offer has also been on the table for weeks.",
      "\"There's no way to defend this,\" Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut said in a video on X. \"And you are right to be angry about it. I'm angry about it.\"",
      "Last Friday, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the credits. Republicans swiftly rejected Schumer's pitch, and spent Saturday railing against the ACA in speeches on the Senate floor.",
      "A \"minibus\" of 3 appropriations bills",
      "The deal includes three yearlong funding bills that lawmakers have been working on for months. The three bills include funding for military construction and the Department of Veterans Affairs; the Department of Agriculture and FDA; and operations for the legislative branch.",
      "The bills have been dubbed a \"minibus\" \u2014 a smaller version of massive \"omnibus\" government funding legislation that lawmakers often adopt before the end of the year. Republicans in both chambers have emphasized their desire to return to passing individual spending bills through regular order, instead of through a large end-of-year package.",
      "The minibus includes funding for the relevant agencies and programs through September 2026. Because of that, the agencies would still be funded even if lawmakers fail to reach a funding deal in other areas by the end of January.",
      "Notably, it would restore full funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which faced funding shortfalls due to the shutdown.",
      "A reversal of shutdown layoffs and restrictions on future cuts",
      "The new continuing resolution includes language that reverses the layoffs that the Trump administration implemented during the government shutdown, and prevents any cuts until the end of January.",
      "The resolution states that \"any reduction in force proposed, noticed, initiated, executed, implemented, or otherwise taken by an Executive Agency between October 1, 2025, and the date of enactment, shall have no force or effect.\" A reduction in force, or RIF, is the government's term for layoffs.",
      "The resolution also says that \"no federal funds may be used to initiate, carry out, implement, or otherwise notice a reduction in force to reduce the number of employees within any department, agency, or office of the Federal Government\" until Jan. 30.",
      "The Trump administration began laying off thousands of federal employees during the early stages of the shutdown, an effort that was blocked by a federal judge.",
      "The continuing resolution says that \"Any employee who received notice of being subject to such a reduction in force shall have that notice rescinded and be returned to employment status as of September 30, 2025, without interruption\" and that those employees \"shall receive all pay to which they otherwise would have been entitled.\"",
      "Back pay for federal workers",
      "The continuing resolution explicitly provides money to provide back pay for federal employees, both those who have been furloughed and those who have continued to work.",
      "The legislation ensures that the workers who have missed paychecks since Oct. 1 will be made whole. Earlier in the shutdown, the White House had told agencies that a 2019 law ensuring back pay for workers might not apply to those on furlough.",
      "The relevant portion of federal law states that employees should be provided back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends,\" and the continuing resolution specifies that funds can be used to make the payments.",

    "summary": "Some Border Patrol agents could soon leave the Chicago area, after taking a leading role in the Trump administration's controversial immigration operations in the nation's third-largest city, officials told CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has made plans for U.S. Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino and some of his agents to soon leave the Chicago area, three U.S. officials told CBS News Monday, after taking a leading role in a months-long crackdown that has been marked by controversial arrests and clashes with protesters.",
      "Bovino and many of the green-uniformed Border Patrol agents under his command could depart Chicago as early as later this week, the officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal plans.",
      "The plans could change, the officials cautioned, adding that some Customs and Border Protection personnel are expected to stay in Chicago.",
      "The Trump administration deployed more than 200 Border Patrol agents to Chicago, internal government documents show, directing them to play a major role in a highly visible and contentious crackdown in the Windy City known as Operation Midway Blitz.",
      "While the administration has argued the operation was designed to curtail crime and illegal immigration, Border Patrol's actions and presence in Chicago and its suburbs have been strongly decried by local leaders as heavy-handed and unjustified.",
      "Some of the Border Patrol teams dispatched to Chicago could be diverted to Charlotte, North Carolina for an operation that is expected to start there this month, the U.S. officials said. Immigration and Custom Enforcement, which has a field office in Chicago, is expected to continue carrying out immigration arrests in the region.",
      "Asked for comment, the Department of Homeland Security told CBS News, \"Every day DHS enforces the laws of this country, including in Chicago. We do not comment or telegraph future operations.\"",
      "Bovino, who once led a Border Patrol sector along the California-Mexico border, has become one of the most well-known figures enforcing President Trump's clampdown on illegal immigration. Earlier this year, he led sweeping Border Patrol operations in the Los Angeles region that generated significant backlash, including arrests at Home Depot parking lots and car washes. Bovino personally participated in some of those sweeps.",
      "In Chicago and surrounding communities, Bovino has followed a similar playbook, joining Border Patrol agents in arrest operations that have often sparked tense confrontations with local residents. He's also joined federal agents when they've repelled protesters using tear gas, pepper balls, pepper spray and other tactics that have come under scrutiny. Agents have also been captured on video pointing guns at civilians.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Sara Ellis castigated the use of force employed by federal agents during the Chicago crackdown, questioning the justifications cited by Bovino during courtroom testimony. Ellis extended restrictions she first imposed last month that severely limit when federal officers can use tear gas and other crowd control tactics and weapons, and ordered Bovino and his agents to generally display identifiers and wear body-worn cameras.",
      "Trump administration officials have argued the use of force by federal agents has been justified due to violent acts by some protesters. On Monday, federal officials said they arrested a Mexican man in the U.S. illegally who allegedly shot at Border Patrol agents over the weekend.",
      "In an interview with CBS News last month, Bovino called the use of force by his agency \"exemplary,\" arguing his agents have followed internal protocols. He also said Border Patrol would accomplish its mission in Chicago \"when all the illegal aliens utilize the CBP home app and or we arrest 'em all,\" referring to an app that lets people in the U.S. illegally notify the government that they will self-deport.",
      "Further pressed on the \"marker of success\" in Chicago, Bovino said operations are aimed at both arrests and deterrence.",
      "\"That's part of any policing strategy \u2013 deterrence,\" Bovino said. \"Whether it's to deter a shoplifter in a department store or to deter illegal aliens from both coming across the border and remaining here.\"",

    "summary": "Gary Shapley became a hero of the political right after he blew the whistle on efforts to undermine the Hunter Biden tax probe.",
    "story": [
      "The IRS special agent-turned-whistleblower who has been tapped to lead criminal investigations at the tax agency told CBS News in an exclusive television interview he will let evidence, not politics, guide the agency's decisions on tax probes.",
      "\"Each and every time, I'm going to ensure the right thing's done and that the policies and procedures are followed,\" said Gary Shapley, who previously blew the whistle on what he says were efforts by the Department of Justice during the Biden administration to undermine the tax probe into the president's son Hunter. \"That's my credo.\"",
      "It's a position that could put him on a collision course with a White House that has pushed for investigations of the finances of left-wing groups. In September, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he is \"recommending that those funding Antifa be thoroughly investigated.\" Asked who should face investigation, Trump has singled out billionaire philanthropist George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, both prominent Democratic donors.",
      "Last month, Senate Democrats warned Shapley against using the IRS \"as a weapon to target political enemies.\"",
      "Shapley sat down with CBS News in his personal capacity, along with IRS special agent Joseph Ziegler, a rank-and-file IRS agent who first opened the Hunter Biden investigation. The two have co-authored a new book that will be released on Tuesday, detailing their whistleblowing efforts.",
      "Asked what assurances he could provide to anyone concerned about becoming a target of the IRS for political reasons, Shapley said the agency would not recommend \"something we don't believe the evidence is there to support.\"",
      "\"I put my neck on the line to protect what was right,\" Shapley said, referring to his protected whistleblower disclosures in the Hunter Biden case. \"I hope I don't have to, but I will do it again if I have to.\"",
      "In a statement responding to Mr. Trump's comments, a spokesperson for Soros' philanthropic foundation said all of its activities are \"peaceful and lawful.\"",
      "\"These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech,\" the statement read.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler spent much of their careers investigating tax crimes with virtually no public profile or involvement in the political battles in Washington. That changed after Ziegler began an investigation that led them to Hunter Biden, the president's son. They say they first made protected disclosures to their superiors at the IRS and through appropriate channels in the Justice Department in late 2022.",
      "They then came forward publicly in 2023, alleging the Justice Department \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The two agents alleged they were then removed from the Hunter Biden case and sidelined at the agency.",
      "\"We were retaliated against,\" said Ziegler. \"We were minimized. No one wanted to take us seriously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, their disclosures jump-started the case against Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to the tax crimes the agents had investigated after a Delaware judge rejected a broad immunity deal. President Biden ultimately pardoned his son for those crimes before leaving office.",
      "\"We came forward, under incredible scrutiny, provided the evidence, and ultimately, we changed the course,\" Shapley said, acknowledging he felt vindicated by Hunter Biden's guilty plea.",
      "Their story was touted by the political right as evidence of bias at the Justice Department and the IRS. In March, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent enlisted Shapley and Ziegler as senior advisers looking at ways to reform the tax agency. Neither Ziegler nor Shapley would discuss the specifics of their work, but acknowledged it involves adding new protections for whistleblowers.",
      "\"We are going to continue to support whistleblowers,\" said Zeigler. \"I'm looking to change what had happened that impacted our lives so much.\"",
      "Shapley spoke to CBS News as questions swirl around whether the Trump administration will insert politics into tax investigations. In April, Shapley was briefly installed as acting IRS commissioner, as officials with the Department of Government Efficiency sought to tighten their grip on the agency. Later this year he's set to take over the IRS's law enforcement arm, overseeing about 2,200 agents around the world.",
      "A career civil servant with two decades of experience, he said his decision to blow the whistle on the Biden administration did not secure him the new post, but it demonstrated his integrity and knack for standing up for what is right \u2014 two traits that qualified him for the job.",
      "\"It doesn't matter who's in office,\" he said. \"Every single day I approach my job the same way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.",
      "\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"",
      "The reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.",
      "The resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.",
      "The shutdown deal",
      "The Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.",
      "But the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.",
      "\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "The Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.",
      "The eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused to budge \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure.",
      "\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"",
      "\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.",
      "\"And we're going to live to fight another day \u2014 and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"",
      "Critics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.",
      "\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.",
      "\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.",
      "For his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.",
      "\"I must vote no \u2014 this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Late last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.",
      "The New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

      "The Pennsylvania senator was one of eight members of the Democratic caucus who voted late Sunday to move forward on a bill that would fund the government until at least late January.

      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will decide whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
      "The legal battle before the court involves Mississippi's procedures for counting late-arriving absentee ballots, but comes as the justices are considering whether to revive a Republican congressman's lawsuit challenging a similar law in Illinois.",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in that case, brought by Rep. Michael Bost, in October, though the question before it is a procedural one.",
      "The court fight involving Mississippi's law, though, involves the meaning of \"Election Day\" and could have ramifications for the slew of states that allow for the counting of mail-in ballots that are received after the day of the election just ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "President Trump has often criticized mail-in voting, claiming that it invites voter fraud. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March that targets the rules for late-arriving ballots by directing the attorney general to take \"all necessary action\" to enforce the federal laws setting a uniform election day against states that allow for the counting of ballots received days later. The directive, however, has been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Still, Republicans in some states have sought to tighten the rules around mail-in voting, and in three states, lawmakers voted to eliminate the grace period for receiving mail-in ballots this year.",
      "At issue in the case is whether U.S. laws setting the day of the federal election trump state laws that allow late-arriving mail-in ballots to be counted. Congress has established that in election years, the Tuesday following the first Monday in November is the uniform day for selecting candidates for the House, Senate and president. But in recent years, several states have enacted legislation allowing some ballots to be received and counted after Election Day.",
      "In Mississippi, state law allows for absentee ballots postmarked by the day of the election to be counted so long as they're received up to five days after. Mississippi's measure was initially enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic and then made permanent.",
      "Sixteen states in all will accept and count a mail-in ballot if it arrives after election day but is postmarked on or before it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In January 2024, the Republican National Committee, Mississippi Republican Party, a voter and county election commissioner filed a lawsuit against state election officials over its rules for mail-in ballots and claimed they were preempted by federal statutes dictating the day for federal elections. The plaintiffs argued the state's procedures violate their constitutional rights under the First and 14th Amendments. The Libertarian Party of Mississippi is also involved in the dispute.",
      "A U.S. district court in Gulfport, Mississippi, ruled for the state officials, finding that the state's law doesn't conflict with the federal laws setting election day. The court found that in the absence of federal laws regulating mail-in ballot rules, \"states retain the authority and the constitutional charge to establish their lawful time, place, and manner boundaries.\"",
      "Judge Louis Guirola wrote in his decision that under Mississippi's law, no \"final selection\" is made after Election Day.",
      "\"All that occurs after election day is the delivery and counting of ballots cast on or before election day,\" the judge said.",
      "The GOP groups appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, and a panel of three judges ruled for the Republicans.",
      "\"Federal law requires voters to take timely steps to vote by Election Day. And federal law does not permit the State of Mississippi to extend the period for voting by one day, five days, or 100 days,\" Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the unanimous court. \"The State's contrary law is preempted.\"",
      "In his decision for the unanimous panel, Oldham said Election Day \"is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.\" The election is still ongoing while officials are still receiving ballots, he said.",
      "\"Although a single voter has made his final selection upon marking his ballot, the entire polity must do so for the overall election to conclude,\" Oldham wrote. \"So the election concludes when the final ballots are received and the electorate, not the individual selector, has chosen.\"",
      "After the full 5th Circuit declined to rehear the case, Mississippi officials appealed to the Supreme Court, warning that if allowed the stand, the lower court's decision will have \"destabilizing nationwide ramifications.\"",
      "They argued in a filing that voters make their choice of a federal candidate when they mark and submit their ballots by election day, so the election has then occurred, even if their ballots aren't received until several days later.",
      "Counting votes isn't part of the election, Mississippi officials said, which is why that process can lawfully take place after election day.",
      "The state warned that the rule embraced by the 5th Circuit would require getting rid of mail-in ballot rules in many states, and said its decision would open the door to nationwide litigation against those laws, which would invite chaos ahead of the next federal elections.",
      "\"Less than 18 months remain before the next federal election \u2014 and state electoral processes start much sooner,\" Mississippi officials wrote. \"States need to know whether federal law permits post-election-day ballot-receipt laws \u2014 and thus whether they must change their laws to comply with federal law or whether they may change their laws on policy grounds. The stakes are high: ballots cast by \u2014 but received after \u2014 election day can swing close races and change the course of the country.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Republicans, meanwhile, said the 5th Circuit's decision was correct",
      "\"So long as election officials continue to accept ballots, the election isn't over; 'the proverbial ballot box' is not 'closed,'\" they wrote in a filing. The GOP groups said that allowing mail-in ballots to be received after election day extends the contest beyond the parameters set by Congress.",
      "\"Modern election deadlines are anything but 'uniform,'\" the Republicans wrote. \"Many States can't conclude their elections for weeks after election day because they're still receiving ballots from voters. Weeks after the 'day for the election' has come and gone, the elections in those States continue.\"",
      "GOP lawyers argued that adopting the state's position would allow states to engage in \"gamesmanship,\" try new deadlines and could lead to \"fraud, uncertainty and delay.\"",

Members will be given a 36-hour notice, Johnson said, a change to earlier guidance that said lawmakers would have 48 hours to return.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, told reporters he wants the House to vote \"as soon as possible\" on the deal that would fund the government until Jan. 30.",
      "But air travel delays and cancellations around the U.S. could upend the House vote. House Republicans can afford to lose only two votes if all members are present and voting. Any absences could muddle the math and prolong the shutdown fight.",
      "Two Republicans voted against the original version of the bill when it cleared the House on Sept. 19, though it also had the support of one Democrat.",
      "Johnson called the travel disruptions, which have been largely caused by staffing shortages, a \"very serious situation\" and urged members to begin heading back to Washington immediately.",
      "\"As of Sunday, nearly half of all domestic flights and U.S. flights were either canceled or delayed,\" Johnson said. \"I'm stating the obvious to all my colleagues \u2014 Republicans and Democrats in the House \u2014 you need to begin right now returning to the Hill. We have to do this as quickly as possible.\"",
      "More than 1,000\u00a0flights around the U.S. have already been canceled in the coming days, according to FlightAware.",
      "Sunday's vote in the Senate was stalled for hours as the upper chamber waited on Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas to arrive. Cornyn, who cast the decisive vote to hit the 60-vote threshold needed to advance the bill, was held up due to flight delays, a spokesperson confirmed to the Houston Chornicle.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has pardoned dozens of people who allegedly tried to overturn the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, including those who were named as so-called \"alternate state electors\" to certify the results. Ed Martin, a Justice Department attorney whose focus is pardons, posted what appeared to be the\u00a0pardons document on social media, which was later confirmed by the White House.",
      "In addition to these alleged false electors, others granted pardons include former Trump personal lawyer and one-time close Trump adviser Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump's chief of staff from March 2020 to January 2021. More than 70 people are named in the document as receiving pardons.",
      "Electors are part of the 538-member Electoral College that officially elects presidents. In 48 states, they vote for the candidate who won a state's popular vote; elector votes in Maine and Nebraska are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.",
      "The pardon document, dated Nov. 7, starts out by saying it \"ends a grave national injustice perpetrated upon the American people following the 2020 Presidential Election and continues the process of national reconciliation.\"",
      "In a statement Monday morning, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"These great Americans were persecuted and put through hell by the Biden Administration for challenging an election, which is the cornerstone of democracy.\"",
      "The document also says the pardon doesn't apply to Mr. Trump. That circumvents, at least for now, the issue of whether a president can pardon himself.",
      "The attempt to appoint alternate electors formed a core part of a federal indictment against Mr. Trump that was abandoned by the Justice Department earlier this year shortly before he returned to the White House.",
      "He was accused of participating in a scheme to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power after he lost the 2020 election. The federal indictment accused him and others of spreading \"lies that there had been outcome-determinative fraud in the election and that he had actually won,\" ultimately leading to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. Mr. Trump denied wrongdoing.",
      "Presidents can't pardon people charged with state crimes.",
      "Prosecutors in Nevada, Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona and Michigan have filed charges related to the alleged false electors efforts. A judge in Michigan dismissed those charges in September, and many of the other cases have been held up by procedural and appellate days.",
      "Giuliani became a close adviser to Mr. Trump during his first term and was accused of spreading conspiracy theories and other unfounded claims about Mr. Trump's election loss.",
      "Giuliani was disbarred in New York and Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn the election results in Pennsylvania and claims he made in a federal lawsuit that elections boards there were engaged in a scheme to rig the election against Mr. Trump. He later\u00a0declared bankruptcy after being found liable for $148 million for spreading falsehoods about Georgia election workers.",
      "He was also indicted in Arizona for allegedly spreading false claims that the the 2020 election there had been marred by fraud.",
      "A spokesperson for Giuliani, Ted Goodman, said in a statement, \"Mayor Giuliani never sought a pardon but is deeply grateful for President Trump's decision.\" He said Giuliani \"stands by his work following the 2020 presidential election\" and \"deserves to have his bar license immediately reinstated.\"",
      "Meadows was a prominent figure in Mr. Trump's attempts to stay in office after the November 2020 election.",
      "A year ago, the Supreme Court turned away Meadows' bid to move to federal court his prosecution in a Georgia case stemming from that alleged effort.",
      "Others named in the pardon letter include former law professor John Eastman; Sidney Powell and Jenna Ellis, attorneys who promoted the claims; Kenneth Chesebro, who prosecutors said proposed the alternate elector plan in a memo to Mr. Trump; and longtime Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn. Powell, Ellis and Chesebro pleaded guilty in the state criminal case brought in Fulton County, Georgia, over alleged efforts to reverse the outcome of the 2020 election.",

      "Hegseth said\u00a0in a post on X\u00a0that the U.S. carried out two strikes on Sunday in international waters in the eastern Pacific, targeting two boats that were \"carrying narcotics\" with three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board each.",
      "\"All 6 were killed. No U.S. forces were harmed,\" he said.",

      "The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in \"armed conflict\" with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn its landmark decision on same-sex marriage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not reconsider its landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, rejecting a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn the decision.",
      "Davis, who served as the Rowan County clerk, drew national attention when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to gay and straight couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that the 14th Amendment guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.",
      "Soon after the ruling, then-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear sent a letter to all Kentucky county clerks directing them to immediately license and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. But Davis had said that affixing her name to marriage licenses for gay couples would violate her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.",
      "Kentucky later enacted a law that removed clerks' names and signatures from its marriage licenses. But until then, Davis and her deputies denied marriage licenses to several same-sex couples, including David Moore and David Ermold.",
      "The pair sought a marriage license from the Rowan County Clerk's Office 10 days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. But Davis refused to issue one, instead telling them she was acting \"under God's authority\" and advising them to go to another county for a marriage license.",
      "Moore and Ermold sued several days later, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional right to marry. They continued to return to the Rowan County Clerk's Office and were repeatedly denied a marriage license by Davis and her deputies. Moore and Ermold eventually secured a marriage license from a Rowan County deputy clerk in September 2015, when Davis was jailed for five days for refusing to issue marriage licenses in defiance of a court order.",
      "Still, the couple pursued monetary damages as a result of Davis' actions, and a jury awarded them $50,000 apiece.",
      "Davis appealed the decision, arguing that because issuing Moore and Ermold a marriage license would have violated her constitutionally protected religious beliefs, she cannot be held liable. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed, and ruled that the First Amendment does not shield Davis from liability because she was acting in her capacity as a government official.",
      "\"In their 'private lives,' government officials are of course free to express their views and live according to their faith. But when an official wields state power against private citizens, her conscience must yield to the Constitution,\" Judge Helene White wrote for the court.",
      "The 6th Circuit warned that if it were to accept Davis' argument, county clerks who find interracial marriage sinful could refuse to issue licenses to interracial couples, or a zoning official opposed to Christianity could deny a permit for construction of a church.",
      "\"[W]hen an official's discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the Constitution must win out,\" White wrote. \"The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official's conscience so dictates.\"",
      "Davis appealed to the Supreme Court. In addition to asking the justices to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, her lawyers asked them to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Her petition raised concerns that the 10-year-old decision could be at risk, particularly given the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider a number of its decisions based on the principle of substantive due process, including the right to same-sex marriage and contraception.",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and it was unclear whether four of the justices agreed that Obergefell should be reconsidered, and five would vote to overturn it.",

They got money for ballrooms. They got money for everything but when it's to supporting the people, that's now when they are crying, well, we are broke and that's not what the law requires us to do.\"",
      "Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, a Republican, on Sunday called the directive \"shocking\" if it applies to states, like hers, that used their own money to prop up the program.",
      "\"It's one thing if the federal government is going to continue its level of appeal through the courts to say, no, this can't be done,\" Murkowski said. \"But when you are telling the states that have said this is a significant enough issue in our state, we're going to find resources, backfill or front load, whatever term you want, to help our people, those states should not be penalized.\"",
      "Democratic Gov. Maura Healey of Massachusetts said SNAP benefits were processed and placed on EBT cards before the U.S. Supreme Court order Friday night, in line with the previous guidance from the USDA. She said that if Trump attempts to claw back the money, \"we will see him in court.\"",
      "\"Massachusetts residents with funds on their cards should continue to spend it on food,\" she said in a statement Sunday. \"President Trump should be focusing on reopening the government that he controls instead of repeatedly fighting to take away food from American families.\"",

    "summary": "While GOP lawmakers and the Trump administration have downplayed the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, there are state efforts underway to ensure it's recorded for history.",
    "story": [
      "New York Assemblyman Chuck Lavine, a Democrat first elected to state office in 2005, has become one of a handful of unlikely leaders of state efforts to preserve the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "Sitting in front of a bookshelf in his home office in Glen Cove, New York, a historic community just south of the Long Island Sound, Lavine, 78, has a pile of work on his desk \u2014 a proposal to establish a deer management program in his county, and material on organizing a youth reading program and promoting a food drive. And while the Jan. 6 riot might have taken place outside his district, Lavine is working to ensure his constituents are fully informed of what happened that day.",
      "He has proposed legislation in New York to require all public school children to receive instruction about the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In the wake of President Trump's reelection and his claims that Jan. 6 rioters were \"hostages\" and the victims of political persecutions, Lavine's legislation seeks to reclaim the history of the Capitol siege.",
      "\"The idea is to require New York students to be instructed about what happened on Jan. 6 and its aftermath,\" Lavine told CBS News. \"We can't sweep history under the rug. If we don't teach our students about the truth of history, we are doing them a grave disservice. And we'd be doing a disservice to our nation as well.\"",
      "His legislation must be passed by December 2026 to become law. It's one of a series of state and local proposals across America to provide public education or acknowledge the Capitol riot, amid concerns that the history of Jan. 6 is being erased or rewritten.",
      "\"This is part of civic responsibility,\" Lavine said. \"People are entitled to their own political beliefs, but they are not entitled to change facts.\"",
      "\"Anyone of good faith who watched what happened on that day recognizes the threat to democracy represented by what occurred on that day,\" Lavine said. \"The old line is, 'Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat its mistake.'\"",
      "In Washington, House leaders have declined to implement a federal law passed in 2023 requiring the hanging of a plaque listing the names of all of the officers of the United States Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and protective entities who responded to the violence that occurred at the United States Capitol",
      "This past Jan. 6,\u00a0which marked four years since the attack, leaders in the House and Senate held no vigil or ceremony to pay tribute to the victims.",
      "Rafael Macias, a military veteran and father who won a seat in the Maine Legislature in 2024, introduced a Jan. 6-inspired bill as his first ever piece of legislation. It was promptly passed and signed into law by Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat.",
      "Macias' law requires Maine to formally \"remember and preserve the accounts of the witnesses to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\"",
      "He said he decided to run for office because he was \"getting very frustrated at home watching our democracy slip away.\"",
      "Speaking by phone between stops in Maine, Macias told CBS News he's concerned about the rewriting of the history of Jan. 6 and wanted to codify a formal recognition of the attack.",
      "\"There are people who still defend it, even calling it 'not a riot,' 'not an insurrection,'\" he said. \"Some people even blame Nancy Pelosi for it.\"",
      "\"We're seeing something even more troubling \u2014 when history itself becomes one of those spoils. Government websites quietly remove images and documents,\" Macias said in a a floor speech about his legislation. \"Stories of heroism, brutality, courage, and failure \u2014 erased or rewritten to match the language or politics of the moment.\"",
      "The Justice Department deleted its web pages and online catalogue of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, the largest prosecution in U.S. history, shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In Nevada, a group of state legislators passed a formal resolution to condemn Mr. Trump's pardons of the approximately 1,500 Capitol rioters who were convicted or facing charges. The legislation also formally condemns the Capitol attack itself.",
      "State Assemblymember Steve Yeager, one of the bill's sponsors, told CBS News, \"People were outraged not just about Jan. 6, but about the pardons.\"",
      "Yeager, a former public defender experienced in handling criminal cases, told CBS News, \"The narrative that this was somehow a 'peaceful protest' took hold here in Nevada, too. There has been a whitewashing of this event. It's important to bring light to this issue in a public way. It's important to dispel misinformation about Jan. 6.\"",
      "Yeager was able to get his resolution passed in a state that supported Trump in the 2024 election, but he said he was not able to secure any Republican support for the initiative, including from legislators who were former law enforcement officers: \"It was surprising to me, because politics aside, police were attacked.\"",
      "Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who responded to stop the rioting mob on Jan. 6, testified in support of Yeager's bill in Carson City, Nevada, earlier this year. Dunn told CBS News, \"I applaud these states and encourage more to take these efforts and combat Trump's efforts to completely erase what happened on Jan. 6.\" He added that he was grateful for the state efforts \"in light of the U.S. Congress failing to follow their own law and install the Jan. 6 plaque.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's pardons of the Capitol riot defendants included hundreds who admitted \u2014 or were convicted of \u2014 assaulting police officers, some with weapons and bear spray. In issuing his pardons, Mr. Trump said the Jan. 6 prosecutions were \"a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years.\"",
      "Yeager's resolution has no legal impact, but it represents an official statement of the position of the Nevada Legislature, indicating its disapproval of the pardons. A copy has been sent to the Nevada congressional delegation and to the White House by the Nevada legislative clerk.",

    "summary": "A Texas-based researcher produced a 26-page study for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue, which she alleges was \"pirated\" by other attorneys.",
    "story": [
      "A Texas-based researcher has filed several lawsuits against lawyers who represented defendants in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, alleging some of the attorneys \"pirated\" her research and used it in court \u2014 without paying for it.",
      "The lawsuits, filed by Lindsay Olson, allege the defense attorneys infringed on the copyright on her research studies when they made filings in court seeking a change of venue for Capitol riot defendants.",
      "Olson's research firm produced a 26-page study in April 2022 for a defense lawyer in a Jan. 6 Oathkeepers case to argue for a change of venue out of Washington, D.C. Among the many findings in Olson's survey, respondents in Washington, D.C. were likely to characterize Jan. 6 as an \"insurrection,\" \"racially motivated\" or \"planned in advance\" than prospective jurors in other regions of the country. The survey also argued the jury pool in Washington, D.C., was more likely to feel \"personally\" affected or less safe because of the Capitol siege by the mob of Trump supporters.",
      "Dozens of Jan. 6 defendants sought a change-of-venue, several using Olson's research study in their arguments.\u00a0 None of them succeeded in their arguments.\u00a0 But Olson's lawsuits allege some defense attorneys used her study in court, without paying her a fee for her service or the rights to use her material.",
      "James Bartolomei, a civil attorney representing Olson in her lawsuits, told CBS News, \"Each lawyer exploited the entire written report for the very same purpose that she created it, which was for use in support of a motion to transfer venue out of DC. The report has a fair market value of $30,000 per case.\"",
      "One of Olson's lawsuits alleged D.C.-based defense attorney Kira West \"pirated a copyrighted expert report and used that report in three separate criminal cases for the very purpose the report was originally created.\" A CBS News review found Olson's research was included in court motions filed by West in multiple cases, including her defense of Alex Harkrider, who was accused of carrying a tomahawk axe while amid the mob. He was found guilty in 2024 of felony charges of civil disorder, obstruction of an official proceeding, entering and remaining in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon, and disorderly and disruptive conduct in a restricted building or grounds with a deadly or dangerous weapon.",
      "Harkrider, along with roughly 1,500 other Jan. 6 defendants, was pardoned by President Trump on Inauguration Day 2025.",
      "West declined to comment to CBS News.",
      "Another lawsuit was filed against Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward, who represented Federico Klein in his Jan. 6 trial. Klein, a Marine veteran and former Trump appointee who worked in the State Department's office of Brazilian and Southern Cone Affairs from 2017 until his resignation on Jan. 19, 2021, was sentenced to five years and 10 months in prison for his role in the riot. He was also pardoned by Mr. Trump.",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "Olson has also filed a separate lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging federal public defenders also misappropriated her jury research while defending Jan. 6 defendants. She alleges federal defenders published her report, in its entirety, at least 11 separate times. The suit alleges Olson \"was unaware of the government's unauthorized use until she stumbled upon a copy of her report with a file stamp of multiple illegible case numbers stamped on top\" of\u00a0 other case numbers.\"",
      "Olson's lawsuit against the Trump administration argues, \"The Government, through the public defenders alleged above, directly benefitted financially from copyright infringement of the April 2022 Report by not paying Plaintiff a reasonable fair market value licensing fee for each use of the Report, which is $30,000 per use.\"",
      "The lawsuit said, \"In exchange for a $30,000 fee, Plaintiff licensed a copy of the Report to the Requesting Attorneys, authorizing them to use it in support of their motions to transfer venue based on alleged prejudicial bias in the District of Columbia's jury pool.\"",
      "Judges universally denied requests by Capitol riot defendants to transfer their cases to other federal districts in America, despite repeated claims that jurors would be biased in the District of Columbia, due to media coverage and personal connections to victims of the attack.",
      "In a statement to CBS News through her attorney, Olson said, \"if everyone stole authors' work all the time, there would eventually be none made at all.\u00a0 Everyone understands that would be wrong.\"",
      "Some judges derided the change-of-venue requests and arguments. A CBS News review of Jan. 6 case hearings found in April 2024, a federal judge denied such a request from a riot defendant and remarked that \"while there has certainly been significant media coverage of Jan. 6, much of it has consisted only of straightforward, unemotional factual accounts of events.\"\u00a0 In July 2023, federal judge Rudolph Contreras rejected another riot defendant's request and ruled, \"a fair trial is possible even where that impact is a result of particularly heinous crimes.\"",

    "summary": "James D. Watson, who helped discover the structure of DNA, has died at 97 years old.",
    "story": [
      "James D. Watson, whose co-discovery of the twisted-ladder structure of DNA in 1953 helped light the long fuse on a revolution in medicine, crimefighting, genealogy and ethics, has died, according to his former research lab. He was 97.",
      "The breakthrough \u2014 made when the brash, Chicago-born Watson was just 24 \u2014 turned him into a hallowed figure in the world of science for decades. But later in life, he faced condemnation and professional censure for offensive remarks.",
      "Watson shared a 1962 Nobel Prize with Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins for discovering that deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is a double helix, consisting of two strands that coil around each other to create what resembles a long, gently twisting ladder. In 2014, he became the first living prizewinner to auction off their medal, though the purchaser returned the award to him several months later.",
      "The breakthrough discovery suggested how hereditary information is stored and how cells duplicate their DNA when they divide. The duplication begins with the two strands of DNA pulling apart like a zipper. Even among non-scientists, the double helix would become an instantly recognized symbol of science, showing up in such places as the work of Salvador Dali and a British postage stamp.",
      "The findings, based on data from Wilkins, Rosalind Franklin and other colleagues at King's College London, were a \"pivotal moment in the life sciences,\" said the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in Long Island.",
      "Watson spent much of his career at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, becoming its director in 1968 and focusing the facility's research on DNA viruses that cause cancer. Watson, his wife and their two children lived on the laboratory's grounds for decades.",
      "\"Watson's extraordinary contributions to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory during his long tenure transformed a small, but important laboratory on the North Shore of Long Island into one of the world's leading research institutes,\" the institution said.",
      "Watson continued to make scientific discoveries. While at Cambridge in England, he carried out pioneering research on the structure of small viruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory said. He also helped demonstrate the existence of mRNA in his lab at Harvard University in partnership with researchers at Cambridge, and later discovered important bacterial proteins that control gene expression, the laboratory said. He also wrote influential textbooks and a best-selling memoir, mentored young scientists and guided the early years of the Human Genome Project.",
      "Watson gained unwelcome attention in 2007, when London's Sunday Times Magazine quoted him as saying he was \"inherently gloomy about the prospect of Africa\" because \"all our social policies are based on the fact that their intelligence is the same as ours \u2014 where all the testing says not really.\" He said that while he hopes everyone is equal, \"people who have to deal with black employees find this is not true.\"",
      "Watson\u00a0apologized\u00a0for the remarks after international uproar and was suspended from his job as chancellor of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and retired a week later.",
      "In a television documentary that aired in early 2019, Watson was asked if his views had changed. \"No, not at all,\" he said. In response, the Cold Spring Harbor lab\u00a0revoked several honorary titles\u00a0it had given Watson, saying his statements were \"reprehensible\" and \"unsupported by science.\"",
      "Watson's combination of scientific achievement and controversial remarks created a complicated legacy.",
      "He has shown \"a regrettable tendency toward inflammatory and offensive remarks, especially late in his career,\" Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, said in 2019. \"His outbursts, particularly when they reflected on race, were both profoundly misguided and deeply hurtful. I only wish that Jim's views on society and humanity could have matched his brilliant scientific insights.\"",
      "Watson's DNA discovery helped open the door to more recent developments such as tinkering with the genetic makeup of living things, treating disease by inserting genes into patients, identifying human remains and criminal suspects from DNA samples and tracing family trees. But it has also raised a host of ethical questions, such as whether we should be altering the body's blueprint for cosmetic reasons or in a way that is transmitted to a person's offspring.",
      "\"Francis Crick and I made the discovery of the century, that was pretty clear,\" Watson once said. He later wrote: \"There was no way we could have foreseen the explosive impact of the double helix on science and society.\"",

    "summary": "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" said the lead author of the study, which spotlights the impacts of planetary warming on aquatic ecosystems.",
    "story": [
      "When dolphins began washing up dead by the dozens on Lake Tefe in Brazil's Amazonas state, hydrologist Ayan Fleischmann was sent to find out why.",
      "What he and his colleagues discovered was startling: a brutal drought and extreme heat wave that began in September 2023 had transformed the lake into a steaming cauldron. The lake's waters reached 41 degrees Celsius, or 105.8 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hotter than most spa baths.",
      "Their findings, published Thursday in the journal Science, spotlight the impacts of planetary warming on tropical regions and aquatic ecosystems, and come as the United Nations' COP30 climate talks kick off in Brazil.",
      "\"You couldn't put your finger in the water,\" lead author Fleischmann, of western Brazil's Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development, told AFP.",
      "He recalled the \"psychological impact\" of seeing the carcasses of Amazon River dolphins and tucuxis, another freshwater dolphin species.",
      "It's an \"overlooked problem,\" he said, adding that tropical lakes, essential for the food security and livelihoods of local communities, have been far less studied than those in Europe and North America, and were assumed to be relatively stable.",
      "While this study focused on 2023, another record-breaking drought happened in the Amazon a year later. Such events are becoming more frequent, severe, and longer-lasting as a result of human-caused climate change.",
      "In all, the team visited 10 central Amazonian lakes, finding that five experienced exceptionally high daytime water temperatures exceeding 37 degrees Celsius, far higher than the 29-30 degrees Celsius considered normal.",
      "The most extreme reading came from Lake Tefe, which saw its surface area shrink by about 75%.",
      "According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, a hot tub is typically set between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit, or just under 40 degrees Celsius.",
      "Officials from the\u00a0World Wildlife Fund Brazil\u00a0said 153 dolphins were found dead the week of Sept. 23, 2023, including 130\u00a0pink dolphins\u00a0and 23\u00a0tucuxi dolphins. Both are listed as endangered on the IUCN Red List and the latter of which are considered \"the guardians of rivers and a symbol of good luck,\" according to RiverDolphins.org.",
      "\"The climate emergency is here\"",
      "What made it even more remarkable, said Fleischmann, was that the same temperature was found not just at the surface but throughout the two-meter-deep water column.",
      "Using computer modeling, the team identified four key drivers: strong solar heating, shallow waters, low wind speeds, and high turbidity \u2014 a measure of water haziness.",
      "These factors reinforce one another. Shallowness increases turbidity, which traps more heat, while low wind carries less heat away, leaving the water more exposed to clear skies and intense sunlight.",
      "Another stressor for aquatic life was the large swing between highs and lows, with the peak of 41C in Tefe followed by a nighttime low of 27C.",

    "story": [
      "Apple called out European officials in a heated letter shared with CBS News, arguing European Union regulations that forced the tech giant to allow smaller rivals into its App Store have made its platform less safe for consumers.",
      "Because of the changes, \"risks to users on our devices will inevitably increase,\" Apple Vice President Kyle Andeer says in a letter Thursday to the European Commission, the EU's executive body.",
      "Apple accuses the EU of having an \"enforcement agenda\" that seeks to \"undermine the security and privacy of iOS and iPadOS.\"",
      "It's the latest complaint from an American company about alleged overreach from the EU's powerful digital laws.",
      "The tensions have factored into U.S. trade negotiations. In August, President Trump\u00a0threatened higher tariffs on countries with tech rules he believes are discriminatory to U.S. companies. In an April op-ed, Mr. Trump's trade adviser Peter Navarro accused the EU of engaging in \"lawfare\" to \"target America's largest tech firms.\"",
      "In recent years, the EU passed two major laws governing online platforms. The Digital Services Act requires platforms to follow certain rules on illegal or harmful content and advertising to minors, and the Digital Markets Act is designed to promote online competition. Tech companies can face hefty fines for violating either law.",
      "Apple was fined 500 million euros in April for violating the EU's Digital Markets Act by allegedly restricting app developers from steering users toward alternatives to the App Store. Apple appealed the fine.",
      "Since then, the company has become more outspoken in claiming the EU rules have opened the door to financial scams, pornography, privacy issues, and other problems.",
      "In its new letter, Apple says the European Commission sent an inquiry in October that questioned whether the tech company had put in place measures to ensure a high level of safety for minors, under the Digital Services Act.",
      "Apple fired back that the EU's other major law \u2014 the Digital Markets Act \u2014 required it to allow developers to link out of their apps to websites and other apps \"with no meaningful guardrails.\"",
      "\"This exposes users to fraud and scams on those third-party platforms that we cannot control or even monitor\u2014even for apps distributed through the App Store,\" the letter says.",
      "It continues: \"Apple has repeatedly warned the Commission that its approach to enforcement of the DMA is reckless and even dangerous, and urged the Commission to address the new risks their approach to the DMA has created for consumers,\" referring to the acronym for the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The European Commission could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "American tech giants like Apple, Meta and Google have faced scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic, with regulators accusing them of stifling competition.",
      "Beyond the fines in Europe, U.S. officials sued Apple last year, alleging the company has violated federal antitrust laws by imposing \"shapeshifting rules and restrictions in its App Store guidelines.\" And Apple has been embroiled in a long-running dispute with Epic Games, the maker of popular video game Fortnite, over App Store fees and policies.",

      "Popular music artist Xania Monet's voice has been heard by millions, but some fans were shocked to discover she's a product of artificial intelligence.",
      "Monet may be an avatar, but there's very much a real person behind her: Telisha \"Nikki\" Jones.",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me\"",
      "\"Xania is an extension of me, so I look at her as a real person,\" Jones told \"CBS Mornings\" in an interview that aired Wednesday.",
      "Jones created the persona while teaching herself AI just four months ago. The 31-year-old Mississippi native admits she's not a singer, but says the \"lyrics are 100% me,\" and that they come from poems she wrote based on real life experiences.",
      "\"Whether it was stuff I went through, a close family member, or a close friend, I wrote about it.\" Jones said losing her dad at just 8 years old inspired her chart-topping song, \"How Was I Supposed to Know?\"",
      "Billboard says\u00a0Monet is the \"first known AI artist to earn enough radio airplay to debut on a Billboard radio chart,\" appearing on at least five Billboard charts since her first song release.",
      "\"I'm just taking what I love doing and mixing it with tech,\" explained Jones. She says she doesn't consider using AI as a shortcut, though acknowledges that it \"challenges the norm\" and that often sparks strong reactions.",
      "\"I just feel like AI \u2026 it's the new era that we're in. And I look at it as a tool, as an instrument, and utilize it,\" she added.",
      "Jones outlined her song making process, saying she scrolls through her list of poems to see which she wants to make a song about. She puts the lyrics into an AI music-generator app, then adds different prompts, like slow tempo R&B, female soulful vocals, light guitar and heavy drums \u2014 and then clicks create.",
      "AI artist lands multi-million dollar recording deal",
      "Jones' AI music success led to a multi-million dollar exclusive recording deal with Hallwood Media \u2013 and also some backlash from artists like Grammy-nominated Kehlani. Kehlani railed against the use of AI in creative spaces in a recent TikTok video, saying \"nobody will be able to justify AI to me\" and \"I don't respect it.\"",
      "But Jones says she doesn't let critics stop her from making art.",
      "\"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. Technology's evolving. Everybody has different ways of putting in work to get to where they're at. I don't feel that way about it. I still love Kehlani's music. I still listen to her every day,\" she said.",
      "Hallwood Media also defended the artist and said Monet represents a new age of music.",
      "\"What Nikki has done with Xania Monet really represents the future of music. It shows that taste and instinct have always mattered more than technical dexterity, and we're now seeing that play out in real time. AI is breaking down barriers around age, image, and access, giving creators who might not have had a traditional path into the industry the chance to bring their stories and ideas to life while connecting directly with listeners. That kind of innovation is exactly what drives us at Hallwood,\" Danny Jacobson, the head of A&R at Hallwood Media, said in a statement to \"CBS Mornings.\"",
      "Addressing a concern some have that AI could allow people to make music from racial or cultural backgrounds they may not be a part of, Jones responded, \"That's what I'm here to let them know, I'm Telisha. I'm a part of your culture; I'm a Black woman; I'm a creator; I'm an entrepreneur; I created Xania,\" she said.",

The credits are set to expire at the end of the year, and patients are facing eye-popping increases for their insurance premiums.",

      "\"Each and every time, I'm going to ensure the right thing's done and that the policies and procedures are followed,\" said Gary Shapley, who previously blew the whistle on what he says were efforts by the Department of Justice during the Biden administration to undermine the tax probe into the president's son Hunter. \"That's my credo.\"",
      "It's a position that could put him on a collision course with a White House that has pushed for investigations of the finances of left-wing groups. In September, President Trump wrote on Truth Social that he is \"recommending that those funding Antifa be thoroughly investigated.\" Asked who should face investigation, Trump has singled out billionaire philanthropist George Soros and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, both prominent Democratic donors.",
      "Last month, Senate Democrats warned Shapley against using the IRS \"as a weapon to target political enemies.\"",
      "Shapley sat down with CBS News in his personal capacity, along with IRS special agent Joseph Ziegler, a rank-and-file IRS agent who first opened the Hunter Biden investigation. The two have co-authored a new book that will be released on Tuesday, detailing their whistleblowing efforts.",
      "Asked what assurances he could provide to anyone concerned about becoming a target of the IRS for political reasons, Shapley said the agency would not recommend \"something we don't believe the evidence is there to support.\"",
      "\"I put my neck on the line to protect what was right,\" Shapley said, referring to his protected whistleblower disclosures in the Hunter Biden case. \"I hope I don't have to, but I will do it again if I have to.\"",
      "In a statement responding to Mr. Trump's comments, a spokesperson for Soros' philanthropic foundation said all of its activities are \"peaceful and lawful.\"",
      "\"These accusations are politically motivated attacks on civil society, meant to silence speech the administration disagrees with and undermine the First Amendment right to free speech,\" the statement read.",
      "Shapley and Ziegler spent much of their careers investigating tax crimes with virtually no public profile or involvement in the political battles in Washington. That changed after Ziegler began an investigation that led them to Hunter Biden, the president's son. They say they first made protected disclosures to their superiors at the IRS and through appropriate channels in the Justice Department in late 2022.",
      "They then came forward publicly in 2023, alleging the Justice Department \"slow-walked\" the yearslong tax probe into Hunter Biden, and that prosecutors told them not to pursue investigative leads related to his father, former President Joe Biden.",
      "The two agents alleged they were then removed from the Hunter Biden case and sidelined at the agency.",
      "\"We were retaliated against,\" said Ziegler. \"We were minimized. No one wanted to take us seriously.\"",
      "Meanwhile, their disclosures jump-started the case against Hunter Biden, who pleaded guilty to the tax crimes the agents had investigated after a Delaware judge rejected a broad immunity deal. President Biden ultimately pardoned his son for those crimes before leaving office.",
      "\"We came forward, under incredible scrutiny, provided the evidence, and ultimately, we changed the course,\" Shapley said, acknowledging he felt vindicated by Hunter Biden's guilty plea.",
      "Their story was touted by the political right as evidence of bias at the Justice Department and the IRS. In March, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent enlisted Shapley and Ziegler as senior advisers looking at ways to reform the tax agency. Neither Ziegler nor Shapley would discuss the specifics of their work, but acknowledged it involves adding new protections for whistleblowers.",
      "\"We are going to continue to support whistleblowers,\" said Zeigler. \"I'm looking to change what had happened that impacted our lives so much.\"",
      "Shapley spoke to CBS News as questions swirl around whether the Trump administration will insert politics into tax investigations. In April, Shapley was briefly installed as acting IRS commissioner, as officials with the Department of Government Efficiency sought to tighten their grip on the agency. Later this year he's set to take over the IRS's law enforcement arm, overseeing about 2,200 agents around the world.",
      "A career civil servant with two decades of experience, he said his decision to blow the whistle on the Biden administration did not secure him the new post, but it demonstrated his integrity and knack for standing up for what is right \u2014 two traits that qualified him for the job.",
      "\"It doesn't matter who's in office,\" he said. \"Every single day I approach my job the same way.\"",
      "In their October letter, a group of more than a dozen senators asked Shapley about changes he intended to make at the agency, and also delivered a stark warning.",
      "\"Any effort to weaponize the IRS against President Trump's perceived enemies is against the law, an abuse of power, and a threat to the integrity of our democratic institutions,\" the senators wrote, adding Shapley's team \"cannot be the President's political attack dog.\"",

      "Major League Baseball said its authorized gaming operators will cap bets on individual pitches at $200 and exclude them from parlays, a day after two Cleveland Guardians were indicted and accused of rigging pitches at the behest of gamblers.",
      "MLB said Monday the limits were agreed to by sportsbook operators representing more than 98% of the U.S. betting market. The league said in a statement that pitch-level bets on outcomes of pitch velocity and of balls and strikes \"present heightened integrity risks because they focus on one-off events that can be determined by a single player and can be inconsequential to the outcome of the game.\"",
      "\"The risk on these pitch-level markets will be significantly mitigated by this new action targeted at the incentive to engage in misconduct,\" the league said. \"The creation of a strict bet limit on this type of bet, and the ban on parlaying them, reduces the payout for these markets and the ability to circumvent the new limit.\"",

      "\"By limiting the ability to place large wagers on micro-prop bets, Major League Baseball is taking affirmative steps to protect the integrity of the game and reduce the incentives to participate in improper betting schemes,\" DeWine said in a statement. \"I urge other sports leagues to follow Major League Baseball's example with similar action.\"",
      "Prop bets have surged in popularity across the country in recent years. They allow bettors to wager on an individual player's performance, often at a granular level. From the number of rebounds grabbed, yards thrown or balls and strikes pitched, bettors have access to a number of stats to put their money on.",
      "Cleveland pitchers Emmanuel Clase and Luis Ortiz were indicted Sunday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn on charges they took bribes from sports bettors to throw certain types of pitches. They were charged with wire fraud conspiracy, honest services wire fraud conspiracy, conspiracy to influence sporting contests by bribery and money laundering conspiracy. The indictment says they helped two unnamed gamblers in the Dominican Republic win at least $460,000 on bets placed on the speed and outcome of certain pitches, including some that landed in the dirt.",
      "Ortiz's lawyer, Chris Georgalis, said in a statement that his client was innocent and \"has never, and would never, improperly influence a game \u2014 not for anyone and not for anything.\" A lawyer for Clase, Michael J. Ferrara, said his client \"has devoted his life to baseball and doing everything in his power to help his team win. Emmanuel is innocent of all charges and looks forward to clearing his name in court.\"",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 was unconstitutional, allowing states to legalize sports betting. Since then, 39 states, as well as Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico, have legalized some form of sports gambling. The industry's best customers are young men.\u00a0A Sienna College Research Institute poll\u00a0earlier this year showed that almost half of men between 18 and 49 have an active online sports betting account. In theory, you have to be age 21 to place bets.",
      "In a statement, the president of sportsbook FanDuel said, \"The legalized sports betting industry is built on a foundation of dialogue and collaboration with our league partners and the states in which we operate.\"",
      "\"This initiative illustrates our unwavering commitment to building a legal and regulated market that roots out abuses by those who seek to undermine fair competition and damage the integrity of the games we love,\" said Christian Genetski of FanDuel, whose company officially partners with MLB.",

Cabell granted Ortiz his release on the condition he surrender his passport, restrict his travel to the Northeast U.S. and post a $500,000 bond, $50,000 of it secured. Ortiz was ordered to avoid contact with anyone who could be viewed as a victim, witness or co-defendant.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The decision by eight Democratic senators to embrace a deal to end the government shutdown has infuriated many members of the party, with critics saying the lawmakers abandoned the 40-day fight without serious concessions on the health care tax credits that were central to Democrats' demands.",
      "\"Pathetic,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"There's no way to defend this,\" Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut argued. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said \"it would be a policy and political disaster for the Democrats to cave.\"",
      "The reaction is a reflection of the frustration among many Democrats, particularly progressives, who had urged their party to keep fighting after the strong Democratic performance in last week's elections. But the shutdown's ongoing toll was ultimately too steep for some of the party's more moderate members to stomach.",
      "The resulting deal has exposed fault lines within the party that could reverberate over the months ahead and frame the party's internal debate heading into the primaries for next year's midterm elections. And it has led some congressional Democrats and progressive groups to call for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to step down, despite his personal opposition to the agreement.",
      "The shutdown deal",
      "The Democrats who broke ranks and voted to move forward had been engaged in bipartisan talks to find an off-ramp for several weeks. Led by Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and Sen. Angus King of Maine, the deal they struck secured a vote next month on Affordable Care Act tax credits that Democrats have sought to extend.",
      "But the agreement doesn't guarantee an outcome of the vote, and most Republicans have made no secret of their opposition to extending the subsidies. Even if some version of an extension does pass the Senate, House Speaker Mike Johnson has not committed to bringing it up in the House.",
      "\"I understand the frustration and obviously I didn't agree with that decision,\" Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii told reporters Monday. \"But what we have to make sure of now is that the health care fight lives outside of the appropriations process and doesn't depend entirely on the government being shut down. So now we have a fight in front of us.\"",
      "The Senate Democrats who crossed the aisle have pointed to other provisions in the agreement to argue it was worthy of support. A new version of the funding bill would reverse all government layoffs that occurred during the shutdown and prevent them for a limited time going forward. The deal would also restore funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program at higher levels, and pave the way for a bipartisan appropriations process on other spending bills.",
      "The eight Democrats also argued there is value in putting Republicans on the record with a vote on the health insurance issue, which Democrats have thrust into the spotlight with the shutdown fight. The moderates viewed the deal \u2014 after Republicans leaders refused to budge \u2014 as the best possible offer they could secure.",
      "\"We stood up to President Trump for 40 days,\" Shaheen said on \"CBS Mornings\" on Monday.",
      "The New Hampshire Democrat defended the move to cross the aisle despite the lack of tangible progress on health care, saying \"we're going to be able to continue fighting on that issue because of the agreement that we struck with the Senate majority.\"",
      "\"But we're also going to end the suffering of millions of Americans,\" she said, pointing to the millions of people who have not received food assistance, and the federal employees and air traffic controllers who have not received paychecks.",
      "\"And we're going to live to fight another day \u2014 and that's what we need to keep people focused on,\" Shaheen said. \"It's not the Democrats who broke ranks who are the issue here.\"",
      "Critics are also directing ire at the party's leaders for allowing the defections. Almost immediately after the details of the deal came to light, Schumer faced calls for his replacement as the party's leader in the upper chamber.",
      "\"It's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is,\" Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California told CBS News.",
      "\"Tonight is another example of why we need new leadership. If [Schumer] were an effective leader, he would have united his caucus to vote 'No' tonight and hold the line on healthcare,\" wrote Rep. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, a Democrat who is running for Senate.",
      "For his part, Schumer outlined his own opposition to advancing the measure to fund the government Sunday, railing against Republicans for refusing to engage with Democrats on the health care issue during the shutdown while pledging to continue the fight.",
      "\"I must vote no \u2014 this health care crisis is so severe, so urgent, so devastating for families back home that I cannot in good faith support this CR that fails to address the health care crisis,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Late last week, Schumer said Democrats would reopen the government if Republicans agreed to a one-year extension of the health insurance tax credits. But Republicans swiftly rejected the offer.",
      "The New York Democrat faced a windstorm of criticism during the last funding fight in March, when he voted to advance a GOP-led continuing resolution. This time around, Schumer made a point of putting up a fight, engaging early with Republicans and the White House to negotiate a deal on health care while keeping his caucus largely unified against the GOP's funding plan for almost two months. Still, since the beginning it appeared unlikely that the leader would make it out of the funding fight completely unscathed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sean-diddy-combs-prison-chapel-drug-rehab-phone-call/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 19:11:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs was disciplined just days into his sentence at a federal prison, an internal prison document obtained by CBS News shows.",
    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is spending his early prison days working in the chapel and enrolled in an intensive drug treatment program, according to prison documents exclusively obtained by CBS News. He has also found himself facing disciplinary action for an unauthorized phone call, just days after being transferred to a federal prison in New Jersey, with the looming possibility of temporarily losing his phone and commissary privileges as a result.",
      "Combs was moved to the Fort Dix prison on Oct. 30 after being sentenced to more than four years on prostitution-related charges. The photo below, first obtained by CBS News, was taken for prison records upon his arrival.",
      "The documents offer a glimpse at how the hip-hop mogul is spending his prison days \u2014 in a hard-to-get-into treatment program and on a coveted work assignment, even as he is accused of flouting a prison rule.",
      "A prestigious work assignment",
      "Combs is working as a chaplain's assistant, which is considered one of the more desirable assignments at the Fort Dix prison. A former prison commissioner told CBS News the tasks vary, but typically inmates maintain the chaplain's religious library, clean their office and help with some record-keeping.",
      "Combs' publicist, Juda Engelmayer, told CBS News, \"He works in the chapel library, where he describes the environment as warm, respectful, and rewarding.\"",
      "What makes the assignment especially desirable is that it has prestige within the prison, the former commissioner said. It allows the inmate to work in a private office, often with air conditioning, and chaplains frequently bring in food for religious services which can be shared with the assistant.",
      "A corrections officer who worked in federal prisons for more than 20 years told CBS News the chapel is one of the only places where inmates can congregate freely.",
      "Chaplains can also allow their assistants to prepare a call-out list, which tells officers which inmates are allowed to leave their cell to go to programs or medical appointments. Assistants could add their connections or friends to the list.",
      "Combs, who said he was raised Catholic, has spoken publicly about not identifying with any specific denomination, although he has in recent years referenced God several times. In 2017, he wrote on social media, \"God puts us all thru things for reason,\" and he was seen reading the Bible in the courtroom during his trial.",
      "An unauthorized team call",
      "Within a few days of his arrival at the prison, Combs found himself in trouble: He made a three-person call on Nov. 3, in violation of prison rules. He told officials it was a conversation with his legal team about issuing a statement to The New York Times.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons prohibits inmates from adding multiple people to a call, and inmates can only speak to people on prison phones from previously approved call lists, under longstanding security rules.",
      "According to the documents, he called an unnamed woman, and about halfway through their call, Combs said he needed to talk with someone described as \"the digital person\" regarding blogs. The woman asked Combs if she should add that person to the call and he said \"yes.\" Combs first spoke briefly with the woman about arranging visitors for the weekend and suggested they bring cash\u00a0\u2014 \"200 singles.\" There is no indication as to how he intended to use the money. Prison regulations bar visitors from bringing in currency other than coins for the vending machines.",
      "After they finished speaking about visitation, the woman added an unknown male to the call \u2014 circumventing prison rules.",
      "Combs later explained that he was speaking with his attorney and she added the head of legal communications to work on a statement for his approval to be sent to The Times. He said they were not talking about blogs. It was not made clear why Combs was putting together a statement for the news organization.",
      "Multi-person calls are banned in prisons because of concerns that inmates could use them to coordinate criminal activity, such as drug smuggling, gang violence or witness intimidation. However, such calls can also be used for more innocent purposes, such as talking to two loved ones at the same time.",
      "One corrections officer told CBS News, for example, \"They'll call their girlfriend, and ask them to add their mother.\" The source added that inmates run the risk of getting caught but know corrections officers can't truly monitor the thousands of calls taking place within federal prisons daily. There are over 4,100 inmates at FCI Fort Dix alone.",
      "According to prison documents, Combs said no one had informed him about the regulations on phone calls, and he said he never received the prison admission and orientation handbook.",
      "Prison officials recommended Combs lose 90 days of phone privileges and 90 days of commissary privileges for the infraction. Their ruling was filed on Nov. 4 \u2014 Combs' 56th birthday. It's unclear if the recommended penalty has been implemented.",
      "\"This is a serious offense that shows a disregard for the rules,\" a source close to the investigation said.",
      "Engelmayer told CBS News, \"It was a procedural call initiated by one of his attorneys and was protected under attorney client privilege. There was nothing improper.\"",
      "Combs' lead attorney Marc Agnifilo did not comment.",
      "An intensive drug treatment program",
      "Combs has been assigned to the Residential Drug Abuse Treatment Program (RDAP) unit, known as the Bureau's most intensive drug treatment program. Correctional officials told CBS News that inmates need to qualify for the program, and one source said most inmates don't get placed in an RDAP at the start of their sentence.",
      "Sentences can be reduced up to one year by participating in the drug treatment program, according to the Bureau of Prisons.",
      "\"Mr. Combs is an active participant in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) and has taken his rehabilitation process seriously from the start,\" Engelmayer said. \"He is fully engaged in his work, focused on growth, and committed to positive change.\"",
      "Combs' lawyers had written to the judge presiding over his case, Arun Subramanian, to \"strongly recommend\" that Combs be allowed \"to address drug abuse issues and to maximize family visitation and rehabilitative efforts.\"",
      "During his trial, Combs' attorneys referred to his drug use as a primary driver of his infamous \"freak-offs.\" In a letter to the judge before sentencing, Combs blamed drugs and excess for his actions and said he was \"now sober for the first time in 25 years,\" adding that he had been trying his best \"to deal with my drug abuse and anger issues.\"",
      "\"Prison will change you or kill you \u2014 I choose to live,\" Combs wrote in his sentencing memo.",
      "Jericka  Duncan\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California put the blame on Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer after several Senate Democrats cut a deal with Republicans aimed at ending the government shutdown and called for Schumer to step aside from his leadership post.",
      "\"He's the leader of the Senate. This deal would never have happened if he had not blessed it. Don't take my word for it. Take the word of other senators who are saying that they kept Sen. Schumer in the loop the whole time,\" Khanna said in an interview with CBS News' \"The Takeout.\"",
      "He continued: \"Look, I've worked with Sen. Schumer. He did an incredible job on the CHIPS Act, on the [Inflation Reduction Act], on infrastructure. But it's time for him to be replaced. He is not meeting the moment. He's out of touch with where the party's base is.\"",
      "Khanna first questioned the New York Democrat's ability to lead on Sunday night after eight Democrats voted with Republicans to advance a short-term funding measure. In a\u00a0post on X, Khanna called Schumer \"no longer effective\" and said he \"should be replaced.\"",
      "\"If you can't lead the fight to stop healthcare premiums from skyrocketing for Americans, what will you fight for?\" he said.",
      "Schumer is facing backlash from both progressives and moderate Democrats for not keeping the caucus united in the shutdown fight as they sought concessions from Republicans on the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The deal promises a vote on a Democratic health care bill, but does not guarantee an outcome.",
      "Schumer voted against advancing the government funding measure on Sunday. Illinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said Schumer gave the deal \"neither a blessing nor a curse\" and did not direct senators on how they should vote.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, defended his Senate counterpart on Monday. When asked by reporters whether Schumer was an effective leader and should keep his job, Jeffries responded, \"yes and yes.\"",
      "\"The overwhelming majority of Senate Democrats, led by Chuck Schumer, have waged a valiant fight over the last seven weeks, defeating the partisan Republican spending bill 14 or 15 different times, week after week after week, and continue to oppose this effort of passing legislation that does not address the Republican health care crisis by extending the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries said.",

      "Hamdi was in the U.S. for a speaking tour when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him at the California airport, CAIR officials said. He had entered the U.S. legally with a visitor visa on Oct. 19, but it was revoked on Friday, Oct. 24, according to ICE. He was detained at SFO on Oct. 26. ICE previously confirmed to CBS News Bay Area that Hamdi was detained at SFO and said it was because he was illegally in the country.",

    "story": [
      "A U.S. Capitol riot defendant who was accused of firing a gun into the air while among the mob on Capitol grounds on January 6, 2021, now faces charges of sexual assault and kidnapping in Utah.",
      "Prosecutors allege John Banuelos, 40, attacked a woman in the Salt Lake City area in 2018, three years prior to his alleged involvement in the Capitol siege, according to court filings obtained by CBS News.",
      "A DNA test conducted in August linked Banuelos to the 2018 sex assault, prosecutors allege in a charging document filed in Utah.",
      "Banuelos' charges in his U.S. Capitol riot case were dismissed and he was released from custody in January 2025, after President Trump granted clemency to the more than 1,500 people convicted of charges stemming from the Capitol attack.",
      "According to court filings in Utah, Banuelos allegedly invited the victim of the attack, referred to in the court filings only as S.J., to his home in June 2018, falsely claiming there was a party at the house. According to charging documents, Banuelos beat the victim after she entered his house.",
      "Prosecutors said the victim told investigators that Banuelos \"hit her in the face and told her he was going to kill her.\u00a0 Banuelos then grabbed her by the shirt and dropped her on the floor, causing her to hit her head. (The victim) recalled feeling like Banuelos was going to kill her.\"",
      "The victim also told police that Banuelos sexually accosted her, the court documents say. The victim told investigators, \"Banuelos was aggressively kissing her and punched her in the head. She said when she tried to punch him back, he got 'really angry,'\" according to the charging documents from prosecutors. The charging papers also said the victim said that Baneulos \"grabbed her shorts, pulled them off, and threw her, causing her whole body to fly in the air.\"",
      "The charging documents allege Banuelos strangled the victim, who told investigators he \"used a pressure of '10 out of 10' for a couple of seconds. (The victim) said that while strangling her, he told her that she was 'gonna be quiet' and she thought she was 'gonna die.'\"",
      "Banuelos faces charges of aggravated kidnapping and aggravated sexual assault.\u00a0 A warrant was issued in Utah for Banuelos's arrest on Oct. 1.",
      "Police reports obtained by CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act said Cook County, Illinois sheriff's investigators found Banuelos at a Burger King in the Chicago suburb of Cicero on Oct. 17. The sheriff's department said Banuelos acknowledged his identity to officers when they stopped him as a passenger in a ride-share car minutes later.",
      "He has no listed defense attorney in his case in Utah and was not reachable for comment. It was not immediately clear if he was still being held in Illinois or if he had been transferred to Utah.",
      "Banuelos was among the later waves of arrests in the U.S. Capitol siege case. He was charged in his federal Jan. 6 case in March 2024, more than three years after the attack. Banuelos' case was unique among the tonnage of Capitol riot prosecutions, because he was the only defendant accused of pulling and firing a gun while on Capitol grounds.",
      "The Justice Department alleged \"Open-source media and CCTV captured Banuelos allegedly raising the gun over his head and, at approximately 2:34 p.m., firing two shots into the air. Banuelos returned the firearm to his waistband and climbed down the scaffolding, rejoining the crowd below.\"",
      "Banuelos pleaded not guilty in his Jan. 6 case, but never stood trial because of the dropped charges.",
      "During 2024 court proceedings in his Capitol riot case, Banuelos openly and brazenly predicted he'd be cleared of charges because of the reelection of Mr. Trump.",
      "When urged by Washington, D.C., federal judge Tanya Chutkan to be careful about what he said in open court, Banuelos told the judge, \"Trump is going to be in office in six months, so I have nothing to worry about.\"",

    "story": [
      "A massive search operation is underway in West Virginia, where officials say crews are \"working around the clock\" and continuing \"aggressive\" efforts to locate a missing coal miner who became trapped in a flooded coal mine on Saturday afternoon.",
      "\"There is nothing that we would spare to try to save the life of the miner,\" West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey\u00a0told reporters\u00a0on Monday.",
      "The miner is the foreman of a 17-person team that struck a pocket of water inside of south-central West Virginia's Rolling Thunder Mine, causing water to rush into the complex, said Nicholas County Commissioner Garret Cole, citing information from the local emergency management and homeland security agency as well as reporting by CBS News affiliate WOWK. Rolling Thunder Mine is in Nicholas County.",
      "All of the other miners were accounted for in the aftermath of the flood, Cole said on Facebook late Sunday. Officials believe the foreman helped the team escape the flooding and that he is about three-quarters of a mile into the mine.",
      "Multiple local, state and federal agencies were involved in the search, in addition to specialized mining, cave diving and drilling crews attempting to pump water out of the mine, Cole said. By 8:45 p.m. local time Sunday, dive teams had entered the mine for a third time.",
      "\"From reporting from homeland security and media, it is amazing to see the mobilization of these many agencies getting to work so quickly and working around the clock in order to move as quickly, and safely as humanly possible,\" he said.",
      "Gov. Morrisey also\u00a0acknowledged the search\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "\"We've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner,\" Morrisey told Brennan on Sunday. \"We're doing everything we can to locate that person.\"",
      "He said in a statement that \"a section of the mine operation flooded after an old mine wall was compromised.\"",
      "In an update Monday, Nicholas County Commissioner Cole said the governor said there had been concerns about removing water while dive crews are simultaneously deployed, so crews are now trying to remove the water as fast as possible.",
      "Cole said that coal seams inside the mine have \"created air pockets in the 'peaks' of the mine,\" and that officials hope the miner was able to find them.",
      "\"It was stated to me that the air and water is approximately 52-54 degrees, which means the miner would be less likely to suffer hypothermia, but would more be tasked in trying to become dry and keep in an open air pocket of the mine,\" Cole said.",
      "The commissioner called the emergency response \"a learning experience\" for him, in part because of the challenges the mine's terrain presents to search and rescue crews, and the fact that \"it takes so much time to safely and properly\" reenter it.",
      "\"This is a waiting game, in a most unfortunate way,\" Cole said.",

    "summary": "About 1.4 million employees missed their first full paychecks on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",
    "story": [
      "As lawmakers inch closer to a deal to\u00a0end the longest federal shutdown in U.S. history, hundreds of thousands of government workers who've gone without pay are wondering when their paychecks could finally arrive.",
      "It's still unclear when the shutdown might end, though the Senate is working to finalize a funding package. House members were told late Sunday to expect votes on government funding this week, pending final passage of the funding measure in the Senate.",
      "Once a funding bill passes and the government reopens, federal workers are\u00a0entitled to back pay\u00a0under the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019. The law covers both furloughed employees and those required to work without pay, requiring agencies to issue retroactive payments as soon as possible rather than waiting for scheduled pay dates.",
      "As the shutdown stretches on, the financial toll on federal workers has deepened, with some turning to\u00a0bank loans to cover bills. About 1.4 million employees\u00a0missed their first full paychecks\u00a0on Oct. 24 after receiving only partial pay on Oct. 10.",
      "The Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military personnel, said it has seen a surge in interest for its no-interest loans since the shutdown began.",
      "\"More than 350,000 members enrolled for assistance \u2014 18 times the enrollment in the 2018-19 shutdown,\" said Heather Long, the credit union's chief economist, in an email. \"It's one of many signs of how painful and uncertain this shutdown has been for many hard-working families.\"",
      "When will workers be paid?",
      "Under the 2019 law, workers who miss paychecks during a lapse in federal funding must be paid retroactively as soon as the shutdown ends. It directs agencies to issue back pay \"at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.\"",
      "That's what happened after the 2018\u201319 shutdown, said Rachel Snyderman, managing director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank.",
      "\"In prior shutdowns, back pay has been paid at the earliest date possible after appropriations have been passed, regardless of scheduled pay dates,\" she told CBS News. \"At this time, we have every indication that this would move forward.\"",
      "At least 670,000 federal employees are currently furloughed, while roughly 730,000 are working without pay throughout the shutdown, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. If the shutdown lasts through December 1, the group estimates about 4.5 million paychecks \u2014 totaling $21 billion \u2014 would be delayed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-50-year-mortgage-loan-bill-pulte-cost/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 16:41:15 -0500",
    "summary": "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm.",
    "story": [
      "Would a 50-year mortgage make homeownership more affordable? The Trump administration is working on a plan for a mortgage term that spans five decades, Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte confirmed this weekend, calling it \"a complete game changer\" and a \"potential weapon in a WIDE arsenal of solutions that we are developing right now.\"",
      "Details are still sparse, but a 50-year loan could meaningfully reshape a housing market where 30 years is the norm. Experts say homebuyers who opt for the longer loan would see lower monthly payments but a dramatic increase in the total cost of the loan.",
      "\"Borrowers might be able to pay less monthly principal and interest, since the loan would be spread out over half a century,\" said NerdWallet lending expert Kate Wood in an email. \"But the total interest paid over the life of the loan would be staggering, since even with a low rate, you're looking at 50 years' worth of interest.\"",
      "Take a homeowner who wants to buy a $400,000 home with a 10% down payment, requiring a $360,000 loan.",
      "Even if both 30- and 50-year loans carried the same 6.25% rate \u2014 which experts say is unlikely \u2014 borrowers choosing the longer term would save only about $250 a month, Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, told CBS News.",
      "In reality, rates on 50-year mortgages would probably run higher than 30-year loans, meaning those monthly savings could shrink even further, he added.",
      "Yet total interest on that same 50-year loan would accrue to about $816,000, almost double the $438,000 in interest paid over a 30-year term, he calculated.",
      "At the same time, buyers with a 50-year mortgage would build equity far more slowly than those with shorter loans, Wood noted. That's because a larger share of early payments goes toward interest, leaving less to chip away at the principal.",
      "\"Paying down the loan over so much time could also mean building equity at an incredibly slow pace,\" she said.",
      "The Federal Housing Finance Agency said it is \"evaluating all options to address housing affordability,\" including making mortgages assumable or portable. A White House official added that \"President Trump is always exploring new ways to improve housing affordability for everyday Americans.\"",
      "The proposal aims to spur housing demand at a time when many Americans are priced out of the market by high mortgage rates and soaring home values, Berner noted.",
      "The typical homeowner now spends 39% of their income on housing, well above the 30% affordability threshold recommended by financial experts, according to Redfin.",
      "Mortgage rates have eased this year but remain above 6%, more than double the pandemic-era lows. Meanwhile, home prices, though slightly down from their peak, averaged $410,800 in the second quarter, about 25% higher than in early 2020, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "While 15-year mortgages are also available, most homebuyers opt for 30-year loans because the terms allow them to spread out payments over a longer timeframe, lowering monthly costs,\u00a0according to the personal finance website  Bankrate.",
      "What about the interest rate on a 50-year loan?",
      "A half-century mortgage would give Americans an even longer window to pay back their loan, but experts say the monthly savings would be relatively modest because interest rates for 50-year loans would likely be higher than for 30-year terms.",
      "That's because lenders view longer time frames as carrying higher risks of default, notes NerdWallet's Wood. Likewise, rates for 15-year mortgages are generally lower than for 30-year loans because lenders view the shorter timeframe as less risky.",
      "The typical 15-year loan today has an interest rate of about 5.6%, according to Bankrate, versus about 6.25% for the 30-year loan.",
      "Extending loan terms could lift buyer demand, but that might push home prices even higher unless more housing is built, Berner added \u2014 erasing any benefit from lower monthly payments.",
      "\"This is not the best way to solve housing affordability,\" Berner said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court will decide whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will decide whether federal law prohibits states from counting mail-in ballots that arrive after Election Day.",
      "The legal battle before the court involves Mississippi's procedures for counting late-arriving absentee ballots, but comes as the justices are considering whether to revive a Republican congressman's lawsuit challenging a similar law in Illinois.",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in that case, brought by Rep. Michael Bost, in October, though the question before it is a procedural one.",
      "The court fight involving Mississippi's law, though, involves the meaning of \"Election Day\" and could have ramifications for the slew of states that allow for the counting of mail-in ballots that are received after the day of the election just ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "President Trump has often criticized mail-in voting, claiming that it invites voter fraud. Mr. Trump signed an executive order in March that targets the rules for late-arriving ballots by directing the attorney general to take \"all necessary action\" to enforce the federal laws setting a uniform election day against states that allow for the counting of ballots received days later. The directive, however, has been blocked by federal courts.",
      "Still, Republicans in some states have sought to tighten the rules around mail-in voting, and in three states, lawmakers voted to eliminate the grace period for receiving mail-in ballots this year.",
      "At issue in the case is whether U.S. laws setting the day of the federal election trump state laws that allow late-arriving mail-in ballots to be counted. Congress has established that in election years, the Tuesday following the first Monday in November is the uniform day for selecting candidates for the House, Senate and president. But in recent years, several states have enacted legislation allowing some ballots to be received and counted after Election Day.",
      "In Mississippi, state law allows for absentee ballots postmarked by the day of the election to be counted so long as they're received up to five days after. Mississippi's measure was initially enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic and then made permanent.",
      "Sixteen states in all will accept and count a mail-in ballot if it arrives after election day but is postmarked on or before it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "In January 2024, the Republican National Committee, Mississippi Republican Party, a voter and county election commissioner filed a lawsuit against state election officials over its rules for mail-in ballots and claimed they were preempted by federal statutes dictating the day for federal elections. The plaintiffs argued the state's procedures violate their constitutional rights under the First and 14th Amendments. The Libertarian Party of Mississippi is also involved in the dispute.",
      "A U.S. district court in Gulfport, Mississippi, ruled for the state officials, finding that the state's law doesn't conflict with the federal laws setting election day. The court found that in the absence of federal laws regulating mail-in ballot rules, \"states retain the authority and the constitutional charge to establish their lawful time, place, and manner boundaries.\"",
      "Judge Louis Guirola wrote in his decision that under Mississippi's law, no \"final selection\" is made after Election Day.",
      "\"All that occurs after election day is the delivery and counting of ballots cast on or before election day,\" the judge said.",
      "The GOP groups appealed that decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, and a panel of three judges ruled for the Republicans.",
      "\"Federal law requires voters to take timely steps to vote by Election Day. And federal law does not permit the State of Mississippi to extend the period for voting by one day, five days, or 100 days,\" Judge Andrew Oldham wrote for the unanimous court. \"The State's contrary law is preempted.\"",
      "In his decision for the unanimous panel, Oldham said Election Day \"is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.\" The election is still ongoing while officials are still receiving ballots, he said.",
      "\"Although a single voter has made his final selection upon marking his ballot, the entire polity must do so for the overall election to conclude,\" Oldham wrote. \"So the election concludes when the final ballots are received and the electorate, not the individual selector, has chosen.\"",
      "After the full 5th Circuit declined to rehear the case, Mississippi officials appealed to the Supreme Court, warning that if allowed the stand, the lower court's decision will have \"destabilizing nationwide ramifications.\"",
      "They argued in a filing that voters make their choice of a federal candidate when they mark and submit their ballots by election day, so the election has then occurred, even if their ballots aren't received until several days later.",
      "Counting votes isn't part of the election, Mississippi officials said, which is why that process can lawfully take place after election day.",
      "The state warned that the rule embraced by the 5th Circuit would require getting rid of mail-in ballot rules in many states, and said its decision would open the door to nationwide litigation against those laws, which would invite chaos ahead of the next federal elections.",
      "\"Less than 18 months remain before the next federal election \u2014 and state electoral processes start much sooner,\" Mississippi officials wrote. \"States need to know whether federal law permits post-election-day ballot-receipt laws \u2014 and thus whether they must change their laws to comply with federal law or whether they may change their laws on policy grounds. The stakes are high: ballots cast by \u2014 but received after \u2014 election day can swing close races and change the course of the country.\"",
      "Lawyers for the Republicans, meanwhile, said the 5th Circuit's decision was correct",
      "\"So long as election officials continue to accept ballots, the election isn't over; 'the proverbial ballot box' is not 'closed,'\" they wrote in a filing. The GOP groups said that allowing mail-in ballots to be received after election day extends the contest beyond the parameters set by Congress.",
      "\"Modern election deadlines are anything but 'uniform,'\" the Republicans wrote. \"Many States can't conclude their elections for weeks after election day because they're still receiving ballots from voters. Weeks after the 'day for the election' has come and gone, the elections in those States continue.\"",
      "GOP lawyers argued that adopting the state's position would allow states to engage in \"gamesmanship,\" try new deadlines and could lead to \"fraud, uncertainty and delay.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump on Sunday floated the idea of tapping his administration's tariff revenue to send checks to most Americans.",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Sunday said he wants to give most Americans a $2,000 payment funded from tariffs as he defended what's become one of his administration's signature policies.",
      "Mr. Trump touted his tariff policy as helping the U.S. raise new revenue, which he said has driven \"record investment\" in U.S. manufacturing.",
      "\"A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!) will be paid to everyone,\" Mr. Trump wrote Sunday in a\u00a0Truth Social post. He didn't provide additional details on how such rebates would be disbursed to Americans.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously\u00a0floated the idea of tariff rebates for individuals. In July, he said the administration was considering giving Americans a small rebate based on the billions the federal government has collected in tariff revenue since Mr. Trump took office.",
      "The president's suggestion comes as a core section of his tariff policy is now before the U.S. Supreme Court, with some of the justices appearing skeptical last week of Mr. Trump's use\u00a0of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to authorize wide-ranging import duties.",
      "The White House did not immediately respond to CBS News' request for comment on how the administration would disburse the checks.",
      "How could a rebate work?",
      "Typically, rebates and stimulus payments are issued through the tax code, requiring Congress to pass new legislation authorizing the Treasury Department to send checks.",
      "For instance, the three stimulus checks issued during the pandemic were authorized by Congress, with the payments signed into law by Presidents Trump and Biden.",
      "Earlier this year, Congress overhauled the tax code through the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending bill, which created new breaks such as eliminating taxes on some tipped income and overtime. The law doesn't include rebates or dividends for taxpayers.",
      "U.S. Secretary of the Treasury Scott Bessent on Sunday told Fox News that the dividend \"could come in lots of forms, in lots of ways.\"",
      "He added, \"You know, it could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the president's agenda \u2014 you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans.\"",
      "Is there enough tariff revenue to pay a $2,000 dividend?",
      "Paying $2,000 to about 150 million adults earning $100,000 or less would require roughly $300 billion in revenue, according to Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation,\u00a0in a\u00a0post on X.",
      "\"Only problem, new tariffs have raised $120 billion so far,\" she said.",
      "For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the federal government raised $195 billion in customs duties,\u00a0according to\u00a0the U.S. Department of the Treasury.",
      "U.S. importers have paid nearly $89 billion in tariffs imposed under the IEEPA, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data. The Trump administration has also tapped other regulations aside from IEEPA to introduce new tariffs.",
      "If the Supreme Court rules that the IEEPA tariffs are unlawful, those businesses could be entitled to refunds, curtailing the tariff revenue available for rebate checks.",
      "A rebate for most taxpayers would also add to the national debt, York added.",
      "\"The math gets worse accounting for the full budgetary impact of tariffs: a dollar of tariff revenue offsets about 24 cents of income and payroll tax revenue,\" she said. \"Adjusting for that, tariffs have raised $90 billion of net revenues compared to Trump's proposed $300 billion rebate.\"",
      "On Monday, Mr. Trump said in a Truth Social post that \"money left over\" from the payments would be used to pay down the national debt.",
      "Could tariff checks boost inflation?",
      "The stimulus checks during the pandemic were credited by economists with boosting inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022. Sending ew tariff checks to almost every U.S. household could risk another bout of inflation by stimulating demand for goods and services without boosting their supply, York said.",
      "That could occur at a time when inflation is already inching higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs,\u00a0according to economists. While U.S. businesses are eating some of the tariffs in the form of lower profits, they're also passing some costs onto consumers.",
      "Tariff dividends \"would be another factor pushing inflation up rather than bringing it down,\" she said, noting that the stimulus checks likely boosted inflation by between one to three percentage points.",
      "\"It would be smaller, but it would still increase the budget deficit by giving people more money,\" she added.",

      "\"I will no longer be writing Berkshire's annual report or talking endlessly at the annual meeting,\" the 95-year-old wrote in the letter. \"As the British would say, I'm 'going quiet.'\"",
      "Buffett's shareholder\u00a0letters\u00a0have long been considered essential reading for investors, offering insights into Berkshire's performance, plainspoken wisdom and reflections on business and life. In his new eight-page message, Buffett reminisced about his childhood in Omaha, Nebraska, the people who shaped his career, and the values that guided him, while noting that his health remains good.",
      "\"To my surprise, I generally feel good,\" he wrote. \"Though I move slowly and read with increasing difficulty, I am at the office five days a week where I work with wonderful people.\"",
      "He also laid out what comes next for the company he helped shepherd to success and his plans for his company shares.",
      "More than 2.7 million shares will go to four family foundations, with 1.5 million shares given to The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation and 400,000 shares to each of The Sherwood Foundation, The Howard G. Buffett Foundation and NoVo Foundation, Berkshire Hathaway announced on Monday.",

      "Buffett took majority control of the company in 1965, transforming it from a textile manufacturer into one of the world's leading investment operations. Berkshire Hathaway now ranks as the 9th largest U.S. company in terms of market capitalization, behind tech giants like NVIDIA and Amazon.",
      "The company's success has catapulted Buffett into the ranks of the world's richest people, giving him a net worth of more than $150 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.",
      "In his latest letter, Buffett reiterated his belief in Abel as his successor. \"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "Buffett added he plans to continue writing an annual Thanksgiving message to his children and shareholders.",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 09:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn its landmark decision on same-sex marriage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday said it will not reconsider its landmark ruling that established the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, rejecting a bid by former Kentucky county clerk Kim Davis to overturn the decision.",
      "Davis, who served as the Rowan County clerk, drew national attention when she stopped issuing marriage licenses to gay and straight couples in the wake of the Supreme Court's 2015 decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which held that the 14th Amendment guarantees same-sex couples the right to marry.",
      "Soon after the ruling, then-Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear sent a letter to all Kentucky county clerks directing them to immediately license and recognize the marriages of same-sex couples. But Davis had said that affixing her name to marriage licenses for gay couples would violate her sincerely held religious belief that marriage is between one man and one woman.",
      "Kentucky later enacted a law that removed clerks' names and signatures from its marriage licenses. But until then, Davis and her deputies denied marriage licenses to several same-sex couples, including David Moore and David Ermold.",
      "The pair sought a marriage license from the Rowan County Clerk's Office 10 days after the Supreme Court legalized gay marriage. But Davis refused to issue one, instead telling them she was acting \"under God's authority\" and advising them to go to another county for a marriage license.",
      "Moore and Ermold sued several days later, alleging that Davis violated their constitutional right to marry. They continued to return to the Rowan County Clerk's Office and were repeatedly denied a marriage license by Davis and her deputies. Moore and Ermold eventually secured a marriage license from a Rowan County deputy clerk in September 2015, when Davis was jailed for five days for refusing to issue marriage licenses in defiance of a court order.",
      "Still, the couple pursued monetary damages as a result of Davis' actions, and a jury awarded them $50,000 apiece.",
      "Davis appealed the decision, arguing that because issuing Moore and Ermold a marriage license would have violated her constitutionally protected religious beliefs, she cannot be held liable. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit disagreed, and ruled that the First Amendment does not shield Davis from liability because she was acting in her capacity as a government official.",
      "\"In their 'private lives,' government officials are of course free to express their views and live according to their faith. But when an official wields state power against private citizens, her conscience must yield to the Constitution,\" Judge Helene White wrote for the court.",
      "The 6th Circuit warned that if it were to accept Davis' argument, county clerks who find interracial marriage sinful could refuse to issue licenses to interracial couples, or a zoning official opposed to Christianity could deny a permit for construction of a church.",
      "\"[W]hen an official's discharge of her duties according to her conscience violates the constitutional rights of citizens, the Constitution must win out,\" White wrote. \"The Bill of Rights would serve little purpose if it could be freely ignored whenever an official's conscience so dictates.\"",
      "Davis appealed to the Supreme Court. In addition to asking the justices to review the 6th Circuit's ruling, her lawyers asked them to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges.",
      "Her petition raised concerns that the 10-year-old decision could be at risk, particularly given the Supreme Court's reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022. In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas suggested the high court reconsider a number of its decisions based on the principle of substantive due process, including the right to same-sex marriage and contraception.",
      "No other justice joined Thomas' opinion, and it was unclear whether four of the justices agreed that Obergefell should be reconsidered, and five would vote to overturn it.",

    "story": [
      "New York Assemblyman Chuck Lavine, a Democrat first elected to state office in 2005, has become one of a handful of unlikely leaders of state efforts to preserve the history of the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol insurrection.",
      "Sitting in front of a bookshelf in his home office in Glen Cove, New York, a historic community just south of the Long Island Sound, Lavine, 78, has a pile of work on his desk \u2014 a proposal to establish a deer management program in his county, and material on organizing a youth reading program and promoting a food drive. And while the Jan. 6 riot might have taken place outside his district, Lavine is working to ensure his constituents are fully informed of what happened that day.",
      "He has proposed legislation in New York to require all public school children to receive instruction about the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "In the wake of President Trump's reelection and his claims that Jan. 6 rioters were \"hostages\" and the victims of political persecutions, Lavine's legislation seeks to reclaim the history of the Capitol siege.",
      "\"The idea is to require New York students to be instructed about what happened on Jan. 6 and its aftermath,\" Lavine told CBS News. \"We can't sweep history under the rug. If we don't teach our students about the truth of history, we are doing them a grave disservice. And we'd be doing a disservice to our nation as well.\"",
      "His legislation must be passed by December 2026 to become law. It's one of a series of state and local proposals across America to provide public education or acknowledge the Capitol riot, amid concerns that the history of Jan. 6 is being erased or rewritten.",
      "\"This is part of civic responsibility,\" Lavine said. \"People are entitled to their own political beliefs, but they are not entitled to change facts.\"",
      "\"Anyone of good faith who watched what happened on that day recognizes the threat to democracy represented by what occurred on that day,\" Lavine said. \"The old line is, 'Those who ignore history are condemned to repeat its mistake.'\"",
      "In Washington, House leaders have declined to implement a federal law passed in 2023 requiring the hanging of a plaque listing the names of all of the officers of the United States Capitol Police, the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia, and other Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies and protective entities who responded to the violence that occurred at the United States Capitol",
      "This past Jan. 6,\u00a0which marked four years since the attack, leaders in the House and Senate held no vigil or ceremony to pay tribute to the victims.",
      "Rafael Macias, a military veteran and father who won a seat in the Maine Legislature in 2024, introduced a Jan. 6-inspired bill as his first ever piece of legislation. It was promptly passed and signed into law by Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat.",
      "Macias' law requires Maine to formally \"remember and preserve the accounts of the witnesses to the events of Jan. 6, 2021.\"",
      "He said he decided to run for office because he was \"getting very frustrated at home watching our democracy slip away.\"",
      "Speaking by phone between stops in Maine, Macias told CBS News he's concerned about the rewriting of the history of Jan. 6 and wanted to codify a formal recognition of the attack.",
      "\"There are people who still defend it, even calling it 'not a riot,' 'not an insurrection,'\" he said. \"Some people even blame Nancy Pelosi for it.\"",
      "\"We're seeing something even more troubling \u2014 when history itself becomes one of those spoils. Government websites quietly remove images and documents,\" Macias said in a a floor speech about his legislation. \"Stories of heroism, brutality, courage, and failure \u2014 erased or rewritten to match the language or politics of the moment.\"",
      "The Justice Department deleted its web pages and online catalogue of the Jan. 6 prosecutions, the largest prosecution in U.S. history, shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "In Nevada, a group of state legislators passed a formal resolution to condemn Mr. Trump's pardons of the approximately 1,500 Capitol rioters who were convicted or facing charges. The legislation also formally condemns the Capitol attack itself.",
      "State Assemblymember Steve Yeager, one of the bill's sponsors, told CBS News, \"People were outraged not just about Jan. 6, but about the pardons.\"",
      "Yeager, a former public defender experienced in handling criminal cases, told CBS News, \"The narrative that this was somehow a 'peaceful protest' took hold here in Nevada, too. There has been a whitewashing of this event. It's important to bring light to this issue in a public way. It's important to dispel misinformation about Jan. 6.\"",
      "Yeager was able to get his resolution passed in a state that supported Trump in the 2024 election, but he said he was not able to secure any Republican support for the initiative, including from legislators who were former law enforcement officers: \"It was surprising to me, because politics aside, police were attacked.\"",
      "Harry Dunn, a former U.S. Capitol Police officer who responded to stop the rioting mob on Jan. 6, testified in support of Yeager's bill in Carson City, Nevada, earlier this year. Dunn told CBS News, \"I applaud these states and encourage more to take these efforts and combat Trump's efforts to completely erase what happened on Jan. 6.\" He added that he was grateful for the state efforts \"in light of the U.S. Congress failing to follow their own law and install the Jan. 6 plaque.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's pardons of the Capitol riot defendants included hundreds who admitted \u2014 or were convicted of \u2014 assaulting police officers, some with weapons and bear spray. In issuing his pardons, Mr. Trump said the Jan. 6 prosecutions were \"a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years.\"",
      "Yeager's resolution has no legal impact, but it represents an official statement of the position of the Nevada Legislature, indicating its disapproval of the pardons. A copy has been sent to the Nevada congressional delegation and to the White House by the Nevada legislative clerk.",

      "Tagliabue died from heart failure complicated by Parkinson's disease at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland, on Sunday, his family said.",

      "\"All of us in the NFL are deeply saddened by the passing of Paul Tagliabue, whose principled leadership and vision put the NFL on the path to unparalleled success,\" Goodell said in a statement on Sunday.",
      "He added: \"Paul was the ultimate steward of the game \u2014 tall in stature, humble in presence and decisive in his loyalty to the NFL. I am forever grateful and proud to have Paul as my friend and mentor. I cherished the innumerable hours we spent together where he helped shape me as an executive but also as a man, husband and father.\"",
      "Tagliabue oversaw a myriad of new stadiums and negotiated television contracts that added billions of dollars to the league's bank account. Under him, there were no labor stoppages.",
      "During his time, Los Angeles lost two teams and Cleveland another, migrating to Baltimore before being replaced by an expansion franchise.",
      "Tagliabue implemented a policy on substance abuse that was considered the strongest in all major sports. He also established the \"Rooney Rule,\" in which all teams with coaching vacancies must interview minority candidates. It has since been expanded to include front-office and league executive positions.",
      "When he took office in 1989, the NFL had just gotten its first Black head coach of the modern era. By the time Tagliabue stepped down in 2006, there were seven minority head coaches in the league.",

    "story": [
      "A British journalist and political commentator who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents late last month at San Francisco International Airport will be released, his lawyer told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Sami Hamdi's expected release comes after he accepted the U.S. government's offer to leave the country voluntarily, according to his family and the Council on American-Islamic Relations.",
      "\"The government agreed to allow our client Sami Hamdi to return home voluntarily, with no order of removal and no allegations,\" Hamdi's attorney told CBS News in a statement on Monday. \"We are currently working out the logistics of his return.\"",
      "Hamdi was in the U.S. for a speaking tour when Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents detained him at the California airport, CAIR officials said. He had entered the U.S. legally with a visitor visa on Oct. 19, but it was revoked on Friday, Oct. 24, according to ICE. He was detained at SFO on Oct. 26. ICE previously confirmed to CBS News Bay Area that Hamdi was detained at SFO and said it was because he was illegally in the country.",
      "In a statement to CBS News on Monday, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin called Hamdi \"an illegal alien and terrorist sympathizer who cheered on Hamas following its October 7 terrorist attack,\" and said he \"requested voluntary departure and, ICE is happily arranging his removal from this country.\"",
      "\"Under President Trump, those who support terrorism and undermine American national security will not be allowed to work or visit this country.  That's just common sense,\" McLaughlin said.",
      "Hamdi's father on Monday reacted to the news on social media, saying his son's release \"brings joy to me, his mother, his wife, our entire family, and all of Sami's supporters around the world.\"",
      "\"I still cannot understand how America \u2014 a country whose political system was built on the principle of protecting freedom of expression \u2014 could treat my son with such harshness,\" Dr. Mohamed Elhachmi Hamdi, who is also a journalist, said. \"Sami, who has visited the U.S. many times, has always spoken to me with admiration about the American people and the kindness of those he met and interacted with.\"",
      "CAIR said Hamdi has gone on speaking tours in the U.S. numerous other times and that they believe he was detained due to his criticisms of Israel.",
      "In a statement on Monday, CAIR said U.S. immigration officials only alleged that Hamdi overstayed his visa, after revoking it \"without cause and without prior notice.\" The government also \"never identified any criminal conduct or security grounds,\" CAIR claimed.",

    "story": [
      "A French court on Friday sentenced an American man to 30 years in prison for killing his estranged wife and mother of his three children and her lover outside Paris in 2020.",
      "Charles Dietrich, 50, was found guilty of shooting dead his former partner and her new love interest in the town of Saint-Maur-des-Fosses in the southeastern suburbs of Paris in July 2020.",
      "The court in the southeastern Paris suburb of Creteil imposed a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years and stripped Dietrich of his parental rights.",
      "\"You coldly contested the facts without expressing any regret or questioning your actions,\" the judge said.",
      "\"I do not believe that by killing the mother of your three daughters, you are being a good father,\" the judge added. \"I hope you understand that.\"",
      "\"I do,\" Dietrich replied, speaking in English.",
      "The American man's relatives said he and his wife Aurelie were in conflict over the custody of their three daughters.",
      "Witnesses told investigators that Dietrich believed his wife had \"stolen\" their children after she received primary custody, according to a court document filed with an arrest warrant for Dietrich in August 2020.",
      "The children lived in France with their mother but spent Christmas and summer holidays with their father across the Atlantic.",
      "Dietrich's estranged wife and her new lover were found naked, their bodies riddled with bullets and covered in blood in the woman's bedroom. Investigators found 18 gun casings at the scene, according to the court document.",
      "Aurelie, 43, and Christophe, 42, had known each other for only two weeks when they were shot dead.",
      "Separated since 2015, Dietrich and his wife had been in the process of divorcing.",
      "AFP is not disclosing the last names of his wife and the man she was with at the time of her death to protect the privacy of their families.",
      "Dietrich claimed in court he had been framed, insisting on his innocence. He followed the proceedings with the help of an interpreter.",
      "Wig, gloves and mask",
      "Earlier this week the judge asked him whether he had enemies who could \"plot to frame him for the murder of a couple in Saint-Maur-des-Fosses.\"",
      "\"He wasn't in the CIA,\" the judge pointed out.",
      "The Colorado resident admitted to returning to France at the time of the crime for less than 48 hours without informing his family or daughters, who were with him in the U.S. for the summer holidays.",
      "Dietrich was arrested in August 2020. He admitted to having gone to Aurelie's place but denied having broken into her home.",
      "Confronted with photos of the bodies, he described the scene as \"savage\" and \"disgusting\" but insisted he had nothing to do with it.",
      "He accused investigators of being biased and claimed that some evidence had been falsified by the police.",
      "\"The police very much think that the law must be followed by you, the suckers, and not by them,\" he said in court.",
      "Earlier this week prosecutor Stephanie Gauthier had described the double murder as \"an act of war following a battle plan, an act of private war\" with the aim of regaining custody of his daughters.",
      "\"He came to the conclusion that his goal \u2014 being reunited with his children \u2014 could only be achieved through Aurelie's death,\" the prosecutor said, adding that he had \"methodically planned his actions.\"",
      "Investigators uncovered numerous pieces of incriminating evidence.",
      "Security camera footage near the woman's home showed a person wearing a wig, gloves and a mask. Footage showed Dietrich returning to a hotel about 3:30 a.m. the next day, prosecutors said in a court document.",
      "Several weeks after the murder, police recovered the frame of a gun from the Marne River.",
      "Ballistics tests determined that the weapon had been purchased in 2019 in Colorado, using information from Dietrich's driving license.",

    "story": [
      "Syrian President Ahmed Al-Sharaa met President Trump at the White House on Monday, continuing a stunning reversal of fortunes for a man branded until three days ago as an international terrorist by the U.S. government with a $10 million bounty on his head.",
      "The former leader of an al-Qaeda affiliate in Syria disavowed Islamic extremism after rising to lead his war-torn country. Nearly a year ago, he led his rebel militia to force long-time dictator Bashar al-Assad out of office and into exile in Russia.",
      "Syria was crippled for decades under sanctions imposed by the U.S. and other nations against Assad, and Al-Sharaa is now seeking to normalize relations.",
      "A senior administration official confirmed to CBS News on Monday that Syria will be joining the U.S.-led Global Coalition To Defeat ISIS, marking a significant shift in U.S. foreign policy. Al-Sharaa's own former militia, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, opposed ISIS during the latter years of Syria's 14-year civil war, when he went by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Golani.",
      "He was expected to possibly sign a formal agreement with President Trump during their in person meeting on Monday \u2014 which will be their third to date \u2014 to cooperate on counterterrorism. That would be a highly symbolic moment, indicating a 180-degree turnaround in how Syria is viewed by the U.S. government.",
      "Under Assad about 12 years ago, ISIS was allowed to grow and metastasize into one of the most powerful terrorist organizations in the world. At one point, it controlled a huge swath of land spanning the Syria-Iraq border.",
      "After meeting Al-Sharaa for the first time in Saudi Arabia in May, Mr. Trump called the Syrian leader a \"young, attractive guy, tough guy, strong past.\"",
      "Over the weekend, he also became the first Syrian leader to shoot some hoops with the U.S. military. Video shared Saturday by the Syrian foreign ministry shows him nailing a three-pointer as he plays with a U.S. admiral and a brigadier general at an undisclosed location in the U.S.",
      "But until Friday morning, the Syrian president was still officially designated a terrorist by the U.S. government, as he had been since 2013. That designation was lifted by the end of the day.",
      "There was expected to possibly be discussion at the White House on Monday about the official lifting of U.S. economic sanctions against Syria, which Mr.\u00a0Trump put in motion in May with an executive order.",
      "That order removed sanctions on Syria, \"while maintaining sanctions on the former president, Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, persons linked to chemical weapons activities, ISIS and their affiliates, and Iranian proxies,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in June.",
      "Al-Sharaa's transitional government has pushed the Trump administration for sanctions relief for months, and work had been underway to ease some sanctions even before the president's May announcement, but other measures still need to be formally revoked by Congress.",
      "In an apparent bid to show its determination to crack down on ISIS and other extremists, the Syrian government announced that more than 70 alleged members of the group had been detained just hours before al-Sharaa landed in Washington.",
      "In September, addressing the U.N. General Assembly in New York \u2014 another landmark moment as it had been nearly six decades since a Syrian leader had done so \u2014 Al-Sharaa told the gathered leaders that his country was \"reclaiming its rightful place among the nations of the world.\"",
      "But to reclaim its place, it also needs to rebuild \u2014 a herculean task that Al-Sharaa recently told CBS News' Margaret Brennan in an interview for 60 Minutes will likely cost $600-$900 billion.",
      "He stressed that it would require the international community's help.",
      "\"The world watched this tragedy unfold for 14 years and couldn't do anything to stop this massive crime,\" he said of the Syrian civil war. \"So, the world today should provide support to Syria.\"",
      "On Monday, he was likely to ask the leader of the world's wealthiest nation to help however he can.",

      "Monday's announcement came less than three weeks after Sarkozy, 70, began serving a five-year sentence for criminal conspiracy in a scheme to finance his 2007 election campaign with funds from Libya.",
      "Sarkozy left La Sant\u00e9 prison by car and later quickly stepped into his home in western Paris. The brief scene was in contrast to his very public incarceration 20 days earlier, when he walked down the alley near his house hand-in-hand with his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, as he waved to supporters.",
      "The former president, who denies wrongdoing, is banned from leaving the French territory and from being in touch with key people, including co-defendants and witnesses in the case, the court said.",
      "An appeals trial is expected to take place later, possibly in the spring.",
      "Sarkozy became the first former French head of state in modern times to be sent behind bars after his conviction on Sept. 25. He denies any wrongdoing. He was jailed on Oct. 21 pending appeal but immediately filed for early release.",
      "During a hearing on Monday examining his request, Sarkozy, speaking from Paris' La Sant\u00e9 prison via video conference, argued he has always met all justice requirements.",
      "\"I had never imagined I would experience prison at 70. This ordeal was imposed on me, and I lived through it. It's hard, very hard,\" he said.",
      "Sarkozy also paid tribute to prison staff who he said helped him through \"this nightmare.\" Sarkozy's wife and two of his sons attended the hearing at the Paris courthouse.",
      "Monday's proceedings didn't involve the motives for the sentencing.",
      "Still, Sarkozy told the court he never asked Libya's longtime ruler Muammar Qaddafi for any financing. \"I will never admit something I didn't do,\" he said.",
      "Under French law, release is set to be the general rule pending appeal, while detention remains the exception. Judges weighed whether Sarkozy presents a flight risk, might pressure witnesses, or could obstruct justice.",
      "Advocate General Damien Brunet, who represents the public interest, asked for Sarkozy to be released and placed under judicial supervision.",
      "That request granted, Sarkozy was expected to leave Paris' La Sant\u00e9 prison within hours.",
      "The former president, who governed from 2007 to 2012, faces separate proceedings, including a Nov. 26 ruling by France's highest court over illegal financing of his failed 2012 reelection bid, and an ongoing investigation into alleged witness tampering in the Libya case.",
      "In 2023, he was found guilty of corruption and influence peddling for trying to bribe a magistrate in exchange for information about a legal case in which he was implicated. France's highest court, the Court of Cassation, later upheld the verdict.",

    "summary": "As in previous strikes, U.S. officials did not release the identities of those killed, or offer evidence that they were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military has killed six more people in strikes on what it claims were drug-running boats, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said Monday, bringing the total death toll in the series of attacks to 76.",
      "Hegseth said\u00a0in a post on X\u00a0that the U.S. carried out two strikes on Sunday in international waters in the eastern Pacific, targeting two boats that were \"carrying narcotics\" with three \"male narco-terrorists\" on board each.",
      "\"All 6 were killed. No U.S. forces were harmed,\" he said.",
      "As in previous strikes, which began under President Trump's administration in September, U.S. officials did not release the identities of those killed, or offer evidence that they were smuggling narcotics or posed a threat to the United States.",
      "Experts say the strikes, which have taken place in both the Pacific and Caribbean, amount to extrajudicial killings even if they target known traffickers.",
      "Hegseth said the two vessels were \"operated by Designated Terrorist Organizations.\" He did not name the groups.",
      "The Trump administration has said in a notice to Congress that the United States is engaged in \"armed conflict\" with Latin American drug cartels, describing them as terrorist groups as part of its justification for the strikes.",
      "Video accompanying the post showed a strike on one boat sitting stationary in the water, and a separate open-top vessel exploding while underway.",
      "A short video clip in color of the moving vessel shows what appear to be several parcels loaded inside. No details can be made out on the stationary vessel, which appears in black-and-white video.",
      "U.S. strikes have now destroyed at least 20 vessels so far \u2014 19 boats and an alleged \"narco sub.\"",
      "\"Under President Trump, we are protecting the homeland and killing these cartel terrorists who wish to harm our country and its people,\" Hegseth said.",
      "The strikes on alleged drug traffickers have coincided with a U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean. So far it has deployed six Navy ships in the Caribbean, sent F-35 stealth\u00a0warplanes to Puerto Rico, and ordered the\u00a0USS Gerald R Ford\u00a0carrier strike group to the region.",
      "The governments and families of those killed in the U.S. strikes have said many of the dead were civilians \u2014 primarily\u00a0fishermen.",
      "Washington says their mission is to combat drug trafficking, but Caracas views the ships as a threat to oust Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who has repeatedly accused Mr. Trump of seeking to oust him.",
      "When asked\u00a0in an interview with \"60 Minutes\" last week if Maduro's \"days were numbered,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"I would say yeah. I think so, yeah.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0last month also confirmed\u00a0that he had authorized covert CIA operations in Venezuela.",
      "Meanwhile, the U.N. rights chief urged Washington on Monday to investigate the legality of the strikes, warning of \"strong indications\" of \"extrajudicial killings.\"",
      "\"I have called for investigations by the US administration first and foremost, because they need to... ask themselves the question: are these violations of international human rights law? Are they extrajudicial killings? I mean, there are strong indications that they are, but they need to investigate this,\" Volker Turk told AFP in an interview.",
      "The United Nations previously\u00a0asked the United States\u00a0to cease its campaign, with Turk saying the killings have taken place \"in circumstances that find no justification in international law.\"",
      "Last week, Senate Republicans\u00a0voted to reject legislation\u00a0that would have put a check on Mr. Trump's ability to launch an attack against Venezuela, as Democrats pressed Congress to take a stronger role in Mr. Trump's high-stakes campaign against Maduro.",

    "story": [
      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",
      "President Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.",
      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",
      "A report out earlier this year from the World Meteorological Organization warned that climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",
      "In a mission statement published ahead of COP30, organizers wrote, \"We have made progress, but not enough. Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present.\"",
      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.\"",
      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "Severe coastal erosion caused by Typhoon Kalmaegi exposed a centuries-old shipwreck in Vietnam, providing a narrow window to salvage what experts say could be a historically significant find.",
      "Initially discovered in 2023 off the coast of Hoi An, the 57-foot vessel \u2014 whose heavy wood-ribbed hull survived hundreds of years of rough seas almost perfectly intact \u2014 was resubmerged before authorities could reclaim it.",
      "Experts have not yet dated the wreck, but preliminary findings suggest it was built between the 14th and 16th centuries \u2014 when UNESCO-listed Hoi An was at the center of a thriving regional trade in silk, ceramics and spices.",
      "\"We are currently preparing to apply for an emergency excavation (permit),\" Pham Phu Ngoc, director of the Hoi An Center for the Preservation of World Cultural Heritage, told AFP on Monday after the wreck resurfaced following the passage of Typhoon Kalmaegi last week.",
      "\"The discovery of this ancient ship is clear evidence of Hoi An's significant historical role in regional trade,\" he said, adding that more of the ship had been exposed this time, \"which could provide us with more information.\"",
      "A team of experts from the Hoi An preservation center, the University of Social Sciences and Humanities in Ho Chi Minh City and a local museum surveyed the wreck last year.",

More than 325 domestic and 61 international flights were canceled over the weekend and into Monday, and more than 6,600 commuters and cargo workers were stranded in ports after the coast guard prohibited ships from venturing into rough seas.",
      "The Philippines is hit by about 20 typhoons and storms each year, but scientists have warned repeatedly that tropical storms are\u00a0getting more powerful and less predictable due to human-driven climate change. Warmer seas enable typhoons to build into bigger storms more rapidly, and a warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, meaning tropical storm systems bring heavier rainfall.",

    "story": [
      "At least 27 inmates were found dead from asphyxiation Sunday at a prison in Ecuador where a riot broke out that left four others dead and dozens injured earlier in the day, officials said.",
      "The inmates found at the Machala prison in El Oro province in southwestern Ecuador had \"among themselves committed asphyxiation, which caused immediate death by suspension,\" officials said in a statement, Agence France-Presse reported.",
      "The deadly day at Machala's prison marks the latest spasm of prison unrest in the South American country.",
      "Earlier on Sunday, a riot broke out at the prison that officials said stemmed from the \"reorganization of inmates\" to a new maximum-security prison that will soon begin operating in a different province. The violent incident happened less than two months after\u00a014 inmates died at the same facility in what authorities described as a dispute between gangs.",
      "Local residents could hear gunfire, explosions, and cries for help coming from inside the prison's walls, AFP reported.",
      "Officials said authorities regained control of the facility following the riot, which also injured one police officer. In addition to the four inmates killed, 33 inmates and one police officer were injured.",
      "Authorities did not specify the identities of the deceased or confirm whether the violence was another case of inter-gang fighting.",
      "Ecuador's prisons have become among the deadliest in Latin America as overcrowding, corruption and weak state control have allowed gangs connected to drug traffickers in Colombia and Mexico to proliferate. Many are heavily armed with weapons smuggled in from the outside and continue to organize criminal activity from behind bars.",
      "Another clash between drug gangs last month\u00a0claimed at least 17 lives\u00a0at a prison located in the coastal city of Esmeraldas, near the Colombian border.",
      "More than 500 people in the country have died in prison riots since 2021. Last year, a series of coordinated riots across multiple prisons led to the hostage-taking of 150 prison guards.",

    "story": [
      "A Malaysian court remanded popular rapper Namewee in custody on Monday, his lawyer said, part of a murder investigation looking into the death of a Tawainese influencer in a Kuala Lumpur hotel room.",
      "Namewee, whose real name is Wee Meng Chee, handed himself over to police on Wednesday after he was named a \"person of interest\" in the probe into the death of Iris Hsieh, also known as Hsieh Yu-hsin, or \"nurse goddess\" to fans.",
      "The 31-year-old influencer was found dead on Oct. 22 in a bathtub at a high-end hotel in the Malaysian capital. She was in Malaysia to discuss a commercial video Namewee had agreed to direct, her social media manager told the BBC.",
      "The probe was reclassified from a \"sudden death report\" to a murder case, with police saying they wanted to question Namewee, believed to have been the last person in Hsieh's company.",
      "Namewee, 42, has denied any wrongdoing and said in an Instagram post earlier this month that \"the truth will speak for itself.\"",
      "His lawyer, Joshua Tay, told AFP that \"the investigation is still ongoing and this is why the police is asking for an extension of the remand,\" which he said the court granted for another three days.",
      "Malaysian media reported Namewee contacted emergency services shortly after midnight on Oct. 22 after he found Hsieh unresponsive in the bathroom.",
      "Police arrested Namewee that same day, after they found nine blue pills believed to be ecstasy in the hotel room, the BBC reported. Namewee denied he had used drugs but tested positive for several illicit substances, including amphetamines, methamphetamine, ketamine and THC, police said, according to the BBC.",
      "On Monday, he pleaded not guilty to the drug charges and was released on bail, the BBC reported.",
      "Namewee, an outspoken hip-hop artist, actor and filmmaker, is hugely popular in China and Taiwan. He sings mainly in Mandarin.",
      "Known for his trademark beanie and often wearing sunglasses, Namewee was blacklisted by Beijing in 2021 after he penned a Mandarin song poking fun at Chinese nationalists.",
      "The track hit more than 30 million views on YouTube.",
      "Namewee has also repeatedly been at the center of controversy in Malaysia, which he hails from.",
      "In 2007, he released \"Negarakuku,\" a parody of the Malaysian national anthem which sparked outrage due to its flippant lyrics.",
      "In 2016, he was detained for several days for allegedly insulting Islam over a video partly filmed inside a mosque in the Muslim-majority country.",
      "He was arrested again two years later again for allegedly insulting Islam with a Lunar New Year video that featured dancers wearing dog masks and performing suggestive moves.",
      "Hsieh has\u00a0over half a million followers on Instagram. She had four other social media accounts suspended for \"adult sexual solicitation,\" CNA reported.",
      "Hsieh's social media manager, who asked only to be referred to as Chris, told the BBC that her family were unable to go to Malaysia to follow up on the case because of their \"severe disabilities.\"",

    "story": [
      "The head of the BBC and its CEO of news resigned Sunday after criticism of the broadcaster's editing of a speech by President Trump. The\u00a0BBC\u00a0said Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness both announced their resignation on Sunday.",
      "Britain's public broadcaster has been criticized for the way it edited a speech Mr. Trump made on Jan. 6, 2021, before protesters attacked the Capitol in Washington.",
      "Portions of the speech were included in a documentary on its high-profile Panorama program and critics said they had been misleadingly edited, missing out a section where Mr. Trump said that he wanted supporters to demonstrate peacefully.",
      "In a letter to staff, Davie said quitting the job after five years \"is entirely my decision.\"",
      "\"Overall, the BBC is delivering well, but there have been some mistakes made and as director-general I have to take ultimate responsibility,\" Davie said, adding that he was \"working through exact timings with the Board to allow for an orderly transition to a successor over the coming months.\"",
      "Turness said that the controversy about the Trump documentary \"has reached a stage where it is causing damage to the BBC \u2014 an institution that I love. As the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.\"",
      "\"While mistakes have been made, I want to be absolutely clear recent allegations that BBC News is institutionally biased are wrong,\" she added.",
      "Speaking Monday morning with some of the BBC's own journalists outside her home in London, Turness repeated that she had stepped down \"because the buck stops with me. But I'd like to make one thing very clear, BBC News is not institutionally biased. That's why it's the world's most trusted news provider.\"",
      "Asked about the White House's accusation that the BBC is corrupt, Turness said: \"Our journalists aren't corrupt and I will stand by their journalism,\" adding that she was confident the \"story will emerge\" as to how mistakes were made on coverage of topics including Mr. Trump, antisemitism and women's rights.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Sunday, Mr. Trump thanked the Telegraph for \"exposing these Corrupt 'Journalists.'\"",
      "\"These are very dishonest people who tried to step on the scales of a Presidential Election. On top of everything else, they are from a Foreign Country, one that many consider our Number One Ally. What a terrible thing for Democracy!\" he said.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster's top executives has been growing since Britain's Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, who had been hired to advise the BBC on standards and guidelines.",
      "As well as the edit of Mr. Trump, the dossier criticized the BBC's coverage of transgender issues and raised concerns about alleged anti-Israel bias in the BBC's Arabic service.",
      "Lisa Nandy, the United Kingdom's culture secretary, thanked Davie \"for his service to public broadcasting over the years.\"",
      "\"He has led the BBC through a period of significant change and helped the organisation to grip the challenges it has faced in recent years,\" she said in a statement on X. \"Now more than ever, the need for trusted news and high quality programming is essential to our democratic and cultural life, and our place in the world.\"",
      "The BBC faces greater scrutiny than other broadcasters \u2014 and criticism from its commercial rivals \u2014 because of its status as a national institution funded through an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all households with a television.",
      "It is also bound by the terms of its charter to be impartial in its output, and critics are quick to point out when they think it has failed",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We go now to the Republican Governor of West Virginia Patrick Morrisey, who joins us from Charleston. Good morning to you, sir.",
      "GOVERNOR PATRICK MORRISEY: Hey, good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So your state has one of the highest poverty rates in the country. Nearly 16% of residents rely on food stamps, that SNAP program we've been talking about. In fact, the very first food stamp pilot program began in West Virginia back in the 1960s. Given the current shutdown and how rural your state is, I wonder are you able to get help to those who need it right now?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Absolutely, look great question. I do want to start out, first of all, thank you for having me on the program. One piece of information coming out of West Virginia. We've had a mining accident, and we have teams down looking for a missing miner. I just want to say that our hearts and prayers go out to the family of that miner. We're doing everything we can to locate that person. Now, when it comes to the government shutdown, we're doing everything we can to help those in need. At the very beginning, I started standing up for the federal workers, and we announced that, to address some of the concerns with food, we were going to send significant dollars to the food banks. By tomorrow, that'll be up to $13 million. I've activated the National Guard and we're doing things to make sure that no one in West Virginia goes hungry. Our people are hurting right now, and I'm doing everything I can to solve the problems while Washington bickers. But I do want to be clear, this shutdown could come to an end right away. It's up to Chuck Schumer or just having six more Democrats step across the line. There's been a clean CR on the table available for some time. People should take advantage of that, and let's get the government reopened and then we can go about the business of fixing the many other problems facing our country.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. I'm sorry to hear about the mining accident. But on the issue of food stamps, Governor Moore of Maryland said that he had been told the state would be punished, essentially, for fronting the money. Is that the message the federal government also gave to you. West Virginia won't get those dollars back?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: No, well, first of all, I want to emphasize the Trump administration has been a great partner to work with throughout the past year in terms of the economic progress that we're making here in West Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Sure.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: But also we've reached out, I was the first person to reach out to the federal government, so we had our national parks reopened.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: And now we're working by activating the guard and putting resources at the food banks. We're actually making a difference to keep people from getting hungry. So we've been in very close contact with the Trump administration, and they've been very cooperative. Look, I think they know, and everyone's frustrated, that you're six votes short. These Democrats are saying no to reopening the government. It's a Schumer shutdown. I think President Trump is bending over backwards --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- To be helpful, and I'm excited about the things he's doing in terms of how he's handling this --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- And the broader economic issues at large.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, there is the fight in the courts, specifically, about providing full food aid. The Trump administration initiated that. I want to play something for you because 70% of West Virginians voted for President Trump in the last election. But here's how he described the food stamp program.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Largely, when you talk about SNAP, you're talking about largely Democrats. But I'm President, I want to help everybody. I want to help Democrats and Republicans. But when you talking about SNAP, if you look, it's largely Democrats. They're hurting their own people.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you made the White House aware of the pain from the food SNAP, the food program disruption, specifically?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Yeah, so we've been working closely with the White House, and I think they know they've been very supportive of a lot of the efforts that we're taking to make sure that people don't get hungry. That's the ultimate goal. We have to make sure we're protecting our people. Margaret, you're right. We have 270,000 plus people on SNAP, but once again, there's one reason why --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- why they're not getting the resources. It's because people are insisting to add all these new pieces on top of just a bill to keep the government open. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Well --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the concern we have. But we've been getting really good response from the Trump administration across the board. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- Whether we're talking about the food issues, whether we're talking about our energy jobs or even just recently, the conversations we're having about President Trump's Rural Health Transformation bill to put resources up front to save public expenditures at the back end. --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- I want to ask you about that. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- That's the kind of good working relationship we've had.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about that because I know West Virginia has one of the highest rates in the country for government insurance. There's concern about rural hospitals. There is this Rural Health Transformation Program Congress set up. Your state could get $100 million a year for five years, but your West Virginia Hospital Association says that your hospitals are going to lose more than a billion dollars per year because of this latest Big Beautiful Bill Republicans passed. How do you make up that kind of shortfall?",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: Well, I think what President Trump and RFK and Dr. Oz are trying to do is common sense. If you subscribe to the adage a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, what they're trying to do is invest the single largest amount of money in improving rural health. And in West Virginia that means everything because we're a very rural state. So the resources can go to invest in our people, to invest in our hospitals, our providers and the technology that actually can move the needle in terms of improving health care outcomes --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- up front. Attacking obesity and COPD and substance use disorder.\u00a0 --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- So we're really excited about that, because if we apply the resources the right way --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Yeah. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- I don't think we're going to have the diminution of public expenditures at the back end.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: This is the common sense approach we're seeing from the Trump administration --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Okay. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- that we're not seeing from Schumer --",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- Alright. --",
      "GOV. MORRISEY: -- and Democrats in Congress.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, we have to leave it there. We are out of time. Thank you. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with New Jersey Gov.-elect , a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Friday we spoke to one of the other big Democratic winners last Tuesday, New Jersey Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill, who is currently a member of Congress \u2013 and asked whether given her new role as the chief executive of a state hard hit by the shutdown, she would support the Democratic Party position of blocking government funding until Obamacare subsidies are extended.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it's really important that we keep up that fight, because we see in the market, costs going up by 175% if the Republicans don't address this health care crisis. We know that there have already been huge cuts in the One Big, Beautiful Bill to people's access to health care. And you know, when we look at this crisis, so much of it is really imposed by Donald Trump. So there is money for him to put towards SNAP funding that he's refusing to do, even though courts are demanding it. Now he's kind of slow walking it, making it very difficult for states to do that illegally, and courts are holding him accountable. We see with air traffic control problem, some of this is because the administration hasn't moved quickly enough at Newark in some of the problems we had over the summer. So we're already down by 25%. Now, with this crisis going on because the President refuses to open up the government, we're seeing another 10% in flights being derailed, and we see continued late and delayed flights. So, it's time that the government- that the Trump administration, that Republicans in the House and the Senate, get serious about opening up government.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When we look at our recent polling, a majority of Americans are really concerned that this shutdown is going to hurt the overall economy. How can you justify the damage?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, it truly is hurting the economy, and you can't justify the damage, which is why the President and the Senate and Republican majority in the House need to get this government open, and they need to do so in a way that's going to stop punishing the American people. I think what we saw with this election is the American people, you know, really demanding that our federal government operate in a way that is going to stop punishing them economically. I'll tell you I ran on affordability, on the fact that I'm going to fight in Trenton to make sure we're cutting through red tape and permitting to drive down costs, but also that I'm going to continue to fight that- for Washington, to address things like the tariff program, which is raising costs and everything from a cup of coffee to groceries, to fight the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' which is continuing to raise costs on education and innovation, housing, health care, to continue to fight this government shutdown so that we can really address health care needs here in the state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You keep saying it's up to the president to reopen the government, but you withheld your own vote on that continuing resolution, that short term funding bill, and over in the Senate, Leader Thune is tearing into Democrats for that decision. He said, It shows you're not caring that there are men and women in uniform frequenting food banks because of the shutdown, not making rent payments, trying to borrow. He said, Dems view this as leverage, and he used that word because it was your House leadership, Katherine Clark, justified withholding votes to end the shutdown, saying that's one of the few parts of leverage that Democrats have. How do you respond to this accusation that it's actually Democrats who are being heartless here?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, when you have the Republicans that have the presidency, they have the majority in the Senate, they have the majority in the House. They've even, many would say- including myself, taken over the court system. Then they have a responsibility to open up this government, and I have to tell you as a veteran myself, I know how devastating that is \u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was Whip Clark who said those votes are leverage.",
      "REP. SHERRILL: We're- leverage to serve the American people. I mean, we see again and again these Republican attacks on everything from health care. Look, if if they don't fund the Affordable Care Act, costs are going to go up by 175% for people here in New Jersey, at already high levels. That is going to kick so many people off health care that's on top of the huge Medicare cuts that we're seeing in the 'One Big Beautiful Bill,' on top of the tariff cuts that are raising grocery prices everywhere, on top of the fight he's in now, which is raising gas prices. So again and again, we're seeing the Trump administration punishing people, and these Republicans have got to come to the table, and they've got to start really working for the American people, and this election showed that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But when you were talking about the extension of the health care subsidies, why isn't the promise to hold a vote on those health care subsidies enough for Democrats to vote to reopen the government?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So we are working hard to address the concerns for the American people, and Republicans, again and again, are refusing to address that. So right now--",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well the leader Thune said they'll hold a vote--",
      "REP. SHERRILL:\u00a0 --part of how we get the government open and they should do it right now, I think we have seen what the promises that Republicans have made have been worth. What he needs to do is actually put the subsidies in. We can serve the American people, we can drive down health care costs, and that's really key.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk a bit about your election. As you said, the economy was front and center for you. Energy prices in particular, you focused in on. In New Jersey, they're up 19% over the past year, versus 6% nationwide. I know you want to declare a state of emergency day one, but what does it actually mean? How quickly will prices come down?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: So the state of emergency will freeze rate hikes, because there are some rate hikes that are set to come into play in the next several months, and I- you know, I'm not going to allow those to be put on the back of the New Jersey rate payer, and we see that the can has been kicked down the road by too many people. So the utility companies have already come to the table to say, okay, let's negotiate those rate hikes. We have money that comes in through the BPU to defray the cost. But what's really going to also happen is, very quickly, I'm turning to adding a lot of power to our grid. Right now, PJM, that's our regional grid operator, has really screwed up the market for various reasons, and so every electron we produce in New Jersey will defray the cost of elect- of electricity we have to buy on the market. So that's why, immediately, I'm going to cut through red tape and permitting delays to get solar done. We're going to continue to build out battery storage, and then in the first budget, we will expand modernization of our natural gas facilities, and in the long term, nuclear.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You said on CNN this past week that there's a feeling working people have not been heard, and that there's too much caution and mediocrity in the Democratic Party today. What? What did you mean by that?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: That- as I was talking to people across the state, thousands of people, they wanted to see an agenda to get their costs down, and something that was going to take place quickly. As I said, you know, I'm not writing a strongly worded letter. I'm not doing a 10 year plan. I'm on day one declaring a state of emergency, not just because I'm furious that, you know, as too many people have failed New Jersey rate payers, that the costs are being dumped on them. Yes, that is a huge problem for me that I'm addressing, but it also, I think, conveys that sense of urgency that I feel to work for the people of New Jersey, so that they know that this is a day one issue for me. They also want to see somebody though that has their backs, because they know that these tariffs are raising costs. They know that the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' is going to take away their health care. They know that attacks on the Gateway Tunnel Project are going to raise costs here and really cut into job opportunities. So they want to know that whoever is governing is going to be focused on governing for them, not a party of one like Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, your criticism there was of fellow Democrats, as I understood it. But let me ask you about Speaker Emeritus, Nancy Pelosi. She just announced that she is going to be leaving Congress. When I spoke to her last on this program, she indicated that she knows it's a problem recruiting new candidates, in part because of the environment we're in, including just how nasty our politics are and the security threats. And she said that's discouraging- in particular women who fear the impact on children. What do you say to those considering for office right now? Are you seeing that that female candidates are fearful of doing what you just did?",
      "REP. SHERRILL: Well, we've worked very hard here in New Jersey to really build out a future and an idea that's going to bring everybody in and- and really working hard to keep people safe. Public safety is a huge issue for me and for people across the state. As we double down on our constitutional protections, freedom of speech, freedom of assembly, etc., but it is a scary time. I remember right after I won my primary, the assassinations in Minnesota took place, and here I have four kids, and I'm suddenly thinking, oh my gosh, am I putting them at risk by running? But you know what? I think most of us are weighing as moms if we're candidates is, what is my kids' future look like if I don't run? And that's on balance, I think people are choosing to run. I see women across our state running. We have, you know, people newly getting into races, and also some of the great, powerful women in our state continuing to serve. So I don't think it's dissuading them, but it certainly is on our minds as we are thinking about, how are we going to keep our families safe as we are running for elected office?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, we'll be watching as you transition into being the next Governor of New Jersey. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Virginia Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to the Democratic governor elect of Virginia, Abigail Spanberger, she joins us this morning from Glen Allen, just outside of Richmond. Welcome to Face The Nation.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Virginia boasts one of the highest numbers of federal workers in the country, and as you know, many of them are not getting paid. You know, some in your party look at your election on Tuesday and the win in New Jersey and say that is permission to hold the line in Congress and refuse to fund the government or fold on the shutdown. Should congressional Democrats view your victory that way?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Absolutely not. Our victory was a victory that was based on a campaign that was addressing concerns related to costs and chaos. My campaign across the past two years have been focused on hearing the challenges that people are facing all across Virginia. It's rising costs in health care, housing, energy, and it's the chaos coming out of Washington that has been impacting Virginians so severely, beginning with the DOGE efforts, of course, continuing with chaotic trade policies, and now in this government shutdown. Virginians need to and Virginians want to see the government reopen, and my expectation is that we will see a congress, a Senate, and ultimately a president, driving us in that direction.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But should congressional Democrats open the government and then talk about health care?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: The government needs to open and it needs to open immediately. We need the president to demonstrate leadership, bringing people together, endeavoring to get through whatever negotiations need to get through, whether it's before or after. My priority is the, is focusing on the needs and the, the devastation, frankly, that more than 300,000 Virginians are facing. And that's just the federal employees, government contractors, they will never get made whole. The entirety of Virginia's economy is impacted by the shutdown, just as we've been impacted by Doge attacks, and the government needs to reopen quickly.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and that's why I'm asking, because there are what, 825,000 enrollees on food aid in the SNAP program. They're in limbo right now. You have immediate pain, so at what point do you weigh that against the potential of health care premiums? I mean, this pain is very real and very acute for people in your state right now.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: And it's been going on now for weeks, weeks too long the government needs to reopen because in addition to the pain that we are already seeing\u2013",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "But eight Democrats could cross the aisle and do so.",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: We absolutely need everyone to vote to open the government. And that's not to say that the challenges we're facing within our health care system are not also immediate and acute. Even the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill will have catastrophic impacts on Virginia, taking $26 billion out of our health care, leading to the closure of at least six rural hospitals. We've already seen three rural clinics announce their closure. Hundreds of 1000s will lose their Medicaid, and so the impacts on health care are already catastrophic. We cannot compound that pain by keeping the government closed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Let's take a break and finish this on the other side of it. Please stay with us.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. We return to our conversation with Virginia Governor elect Abigail Spanberger. Governor-elect, artificial intelligence has created a really big demand for these data centers, and Virginia has the world's largest concentration of them. Power bills are up nearly 7% in your state over the past year. Is that driven by the AI boom? And if so, how do you offset those rising energy costs?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, what we've seen in the, in the research so far is that it is not, the increased costs are not driven by the increase in data centers. There's some bad energy policies in some of our neighboring states that have driven up prices, particularly in southwest Virginia. But looking towards the future, we have to be clear eyed about the fact that we will have an energy crisis headed into the future. And so here on the ground in Virginia, we currently have a rate case where it will be important that large scale energy users, particularly data centers, that the public, know that they are paying their fair share for the energy that they are using. And we have to increase our energy production here at home so that we can meet the demand, certainly of larger scale energy users, but, but also of increased demand from, from our communities. And it is a real challenge that we have to get ahead of. And that's why among the first affordability plans that I laid out was one focused on energy. It's a challenge that is pervasive across our communities and particularly acute in southwest Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Just a few days ago, Cornell University reached a $60 million deal with the Trump administration in order to see their federal funding restored. This is the fifth such deal since the administration began this pressure campaign on universities. I know you went to University of Virginia, as did I, and must be following that. UVA cut deals with the government, including kicking out the president of the school. You called that extortion. But now, as governor, are you going to have to play ball with the Department of Education and the Justice Department in order to keep federal government funding going?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: So it should, It should shock everyone that universities, public and private, are receiving demands from the federal government and that dollars, research dollars, are being withheld, that our universities are under attack. And certainly what we've seen in the case the University of Virginia, a popular, experienced, excellent president was pushed out, and on the ground here, we did not see our governor in any way step up in defense of our university. And the idea that the federal government would be withholding federal dollars, including dollars already appropriated by Congress for research, in order to compel universities to take certain actions, it is absolute federal government overreach, and as governor, I will be clear eyed about ensuring that we have structures in place, including boards of visitors across our universities that want to defend academic freedom and frankly, the viability and vitality of extraordinary institutions like the University of Virginia.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about your party. In 2020 when Democrats lost House seats, you said we need to not ever use the word socialist or socialism ever again. There are some who look to Tuesday's win in New York City of a Democratic socialist and say that your, your party is actually being rewarded for echoing progressive policies. Does that victory create a branding problem for Democrats?",
      "ABIGAIL SPANBERGER: Well, certainly, you know, I'm excited about what we did here in Virginia on Tuesday. I campaigned addressing, wanting to address the issues of costs and stopping the chaos. I'm a capitalist, I'm a Democrat, and I won by 15 points in Virginia. You look to New Jersey, and a similar story in Mikie Sherrill's win now the governor elect there. And so I think, you know, certainly, we're a big tent party, but when I look at what led to the success that we had here, and the, you know, the mandate for real governance here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, it was based on what I campaigned on, the efforts to really address the challenges that people are facing in a day to day basis. And now it's on us to deliver and prove that that really truly the the mandate that we have to work on lowering costs and strengthening our schools and keeping our communities safe and and creating steady leadership here in the Commonwealth of Virginia, particularly in light of the chaos coming out of Washington, that not only was it a winning message, but the winning path towards governance.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you very much for your time this morning, Governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, the, who will be the first female governor ever of the state of Virginia. We'll be right back.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the Democratic governor of Maryland, Wes Moore. Good to have you here in person.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Great to be with you. Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Governor, one in eight Americans use food stamps. In Maryland, you have about 700,000 people, as I understand it, who rely on this for food aid. Since the Supreme Court put that stay in place on Friday, do you know whether that money will actually be available to residents in your state to buy food?",
      "GOV. MOORE: We don't know, and that's why we're not waiting. It is why, just in the past few days, I have authorized over $10 million that's going towards heating assistance for people in the state of Maryland. Over $10 million has gone to our Maryland food banks that we have made public transportation free for all of our federal workers, because they are, in many cases, are going to work and not being paid. And I have also authorized $62 million to go towards SNAP to make sure that SNAP is not going to be interrupted for the people of Maryland for as long as we can, despite the fact that we are waiting for the President of the United States to finally do his job. We are watching the president who is literally breaking the law so people can starve, but we're not going to sit there and tolerate in our state.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you just heard Director Hassett say that they are trying to follow the law, which is why they went to the courts. The USDA did say they were going to work towards implementing full payments and then there was this Supreme Court stay put in place. So, do you have clarity on when money might be coming through at all, what's the federal government telling you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no clarity- clarity at all. In the past- in the past six days, we've received four different measures of guidance from the USDA and from the Trump administration about how to handle it. Where initially it was said, well, listen, we want the states to help, to support and despite the fact that this program was built as a partnership between the federal government and the states, where the federal government were really helping to underwrite these costs for people, and then once we decided to step up and say, we are going to make sure that our people are going to be okay--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- You are fronting the money?--",
      "GOV. MOORE: -- That we are going to front the money. We've now received guidance saying the states are going to be punished for fronting the money. There is a chaos, and it is an intentional chaos that we are seeing from this administration, and where they have money for everything. They got money to fight wars, they got money for ballrooms, they got money for everything, but when it comes to supporting the American people, that's now when they are crying, well, we're broke, and that's not what the law requires us to do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: As you know, the White House says those- those sponsorships for the ballroom are separate from government money. But on- on the issue, though, of the shutdown itself. On Friday, we did see the Democratic Leader Schumer offer to end it if Republicans agree to a one-year extension of the Obamacare health care subsidies. Republicans said that's a- that's a nonstarter. This is going to make this a big issue for the midterms. But would you- would you tell the Democrats on Capitol Hill to dig in? That the pain that the people who are living in your state is somehow going to be worth it in the end, for an extension of a tax credit?",
      "GOV. MOORE: There is no pain that is worth it. Our people are hurting, and they're hurting because of these games that we continue to see from Washington, DC.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But would you tell Democrats, just take the vote, open the government, then keep negotiating health care?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want the government reopened now. There is no state that is dealing with more of an impact from this than the state of Maryland. We have over 260,000 federal workers within our state. That even before the shutdown, Donald Trump had fired over 15,000 Maryland workers, federal workers, more than any other state in this country. But I also know that saying that a prerequisite for having the federal government open shouldn't be kicking up premiums by 90%, by kicking people off of health care. There's a bar- there's a- there's a- there's a barbaric nature to this ask and this request, particularly when we're watching how the Trump you know- the Trump administration, they have the White House, the House and the Senate. They can get this deal done by just simply making a phone call, but they're allowing this pain to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Democrats also have a promise from the Republican leader in the Senate that he'll talk about health care if they reopen the government. Why isn't that good enough? Would you tell your members of the Democratic Party to- to relieve the pain in the immediate term from your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I would tell them that we need to ensure that reopening the government does not mean kicking my people off of health care. That when we're spending time right now over in Western Maryland and Appalachia, and I'm proud to serve as the as the- as a co-chair of the Appalachian Regional- Regional Commission where we're serving Appalachia all throughout not just Maryland, but throughout West Virginia, throughout Tennessee and Pennsylvania. And when we're speaking to our folks out there who are already watching their premiums jump, who are already watching everything become more expensive because of these policies, I don't think that anybody, whether in Western Maryland or any part of my state, would say yes, it's okay, if you just watch my health care go away.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, health care prices are going up, even in the private market, for a lot of different reasons. But let me ask you about what's happening in Maryland. This past Tuesday, out in California, we saw this Proposition 50. 64% of California voters came out in support of what Gavin Newsom put out there with redistricting. This would allow him to charge ahead with plans to potentially gain an additional five Democratic congressional seats. This is gerrymandering. You are looking at midterm redistricting in your state as well. Of eight districts, you only have one Republican. Do you really think Maryland is drawn in an unfair way right now?",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: I think that the reason that I ordered the Governor's Redistricting Advisory Commission is because I want to make sure that we can have a bipartisan group being able to look at the maps in the state of Maryland. This is something that happens every single--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You don't think these maps are fair now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: --this is something that happens every single decade. And if other states are going to have this process and go through this- go through this journey of identifying whether or not they have fair maps in a mid-decade cycle, then so should Maryland. I'm just not sure why we should be playing by a different set of rules than Texas, or than Florida, or than Ohio or all these other places.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because you say those states are being unfair. So why adopt unfair policies in your state?",
      "GOV. MOORE: This is just simply about making sure that we can have fair and representative maps and we can go through our process. It's the reason that I put together this commission where my job is not to draw the maps, that- what we've just simply said is I want this bipartisan commission to be able to actually speak with the people and to be able to go through their process and just simply say that if other states are going to go through this process, that we're not just going to sit on our hands because Donald Trump tells us to. That's not the way this process is going to work.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Your State Senate President, Democrat Bill Ferguson says this could backfire. He wrote, 'I believe mid cycle redistricting twist rules for potential short term advantage while undermining trust in institutions and ultimately, democracy. It's too risky and jeopardizes your state's ability to fight against the radical Trump administration.' How do you make sure it doesn't backfire? Do you accept a map that gives you more Republican districts? You're not going to do that.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think fighting for democracy is never risky. I think that's our job as leaders and elected officials, and--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you're not committing to going with the outcome of what this Commission provides to you?",
      "GOV. MOORE: No, I think the commission of what I want is for the commission to do their work and the commission to do their job. My job is not to draw the maps, and frankly, it's a state legislature's job to decide to vote on it. That is not my responsibility. My job is to make sure that I'm protecting the democratic process. And the Senate President and I, we agree on the crisis that Donald Trump has put us in. He agrees on the fact that we have watched a administration that's using the Constitution like it's a suggestion box. But what I'm simply- and where we- where we differ, is the urgency that this moment requires, the fight that this moment requires. And I personally am someone who is not going to allow Donald Trump to determine whether or not Maryland follows this idea of saying, are we going to do everything we can to make sure we're preserving our democracy.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Kevin Hassett, National Economic Council director, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 9, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin this morning with the Director of the White House National Economic Council, Kevin Hassett. This is now the longest shutdown in American history. The treasury secretary told us two weeks ago November 15 was the hard stop for any paychecks going to US troops. Does that remain the point of exhaustion?",
      "KEVIN HASSETT, DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL: Right, I think that- that's about the right number. And the problem is that under the law, we're not allowed to spend money that hasn't been appropriated. And there is a law, the Antideficiency Act, that says that if a government official spends money that isn't appropriated by Congress, which will only happen if the Democrats vote to open up the government, then you could even have criminal penalties. And so people are very carefully studying the law and trying to get as much money out the door as is legal. And we're very glad that we found a way to get a lot of the SNAP money out, but it's really pushing the boundaries of the law, which is why the Supreme Court had to take that ruling from Rhode Island and put it on hold.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Until the lower court rules--",
      "HASSETT: Until the lower court goes back and comes up with a legal justification for what they said, because there probably isn't one, sadly, which is why we have to get this government open. I mean, the fact is Goldman Sachs, they have a top economic team, and they're estimating that we've already knocked about 1.5% off of GDP. I think that number is probably low if we keep going even a couple more weeks, because there's going to be a massive amount of air disruption, especially around the holidays. And one of these things every now and then when we're talking economics, you and I, we talk about seasonal adjustments and things like that. But the fact is that Thanksgiving, that Thanksgiving time, is one of the hottest times of the year for the economy. It's Black Friday, you know, and all that kind of stuff. And if people aren't traveling at that moment, then we really could be looking at a negative quarter for the fourth quarter.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Which is significantly disruptive to the president's agenda. But to the point you were just making about food stamps, and we saw this Friday, a temporary stay by the Supreme Court that would block full food stamp benefits pending the lower court decision. The administration's argument, as you just referenced there, was that it would be illegal to move around funding and to tap the Section 32 account at the USDA. But why not do this as a short term patchwork solution? Because you have found ways with the military pay to stretch things out. Why prioritize in that case and not do so with food?",
      "HASSETT: Well, the president's job, and all of our jobs, is to uphold the law. And when- I'm not a lawyer, but when the lawyers tell us--",
      "[CROSSTALK STARTS]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But are--",
      "HASSETT: what we can do--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -- that wasn't done with the military.",
      "HASSETT: But, but, but yeah, I think that the military is different because of the commander-in-chief stuff. But the legal analysis suggests that we're doing everything by the book, and then stretching things as much as we can, and basically trying to keep people from committing crimes. Which you know, you know about- in the season of lawfare, if you are a cabinet secretary and you spend money that's not appropriated for that purpose in your cabinet, then they can come back and they can take you to court.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you're also making a political bet that Democrats aren't going to challenge paying the military. Do you really think Democrats would challenge and take to court paying people for their food stamp benefits?",
      "HASSETT: Let's just say that we've seen Democrats--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --if, if Congress is going to fund it, when the shut- shutdown ends?",
      "HASSETT: We- we've seen Democrats take to court people that- on really, really poor charges, and so I think they're likely to do anything.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it seems a political calculation is the point.",
      "HASSETT: Well, we, we don't have a political calculation. Our calculation is to get the government open, to get the food stamps to people, and to get people to be paid, 750,000 government workers aren't getting paid right now. I know you're talking to the Governor of Maryland in a minute. I'm sure his people are really hurting. Let's just get the government open, and then let's talk about things like the healthcare premiums, but do that through regular order.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, it sounds like you are saying the position is the same, open the government, then we'll talk about healthcare. But the president, just in the past 36 hours, has put out a number of social media posts. It sounds sort of like he's proposing something in regard to health insurance payments. He said, I'm recommended- to Senate Republicans that hundreds of billions of dollars currently being sent to money-sucking insurance companies to save bad healthcare provided by Obamacare now be sent to the people so they can purchase their own much better healthcare. He also said they should terminate Obamacare. What does this alternative system look like? Because the entire standoff is about healthcare right now.",
      "HASSETT: Right. Well, the president is, you know, a beautiful tactician, a beautiful negotiator--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is an off--",
      "HASSETT: --And this is- you know, what he said, he's brainstorming and trying to help the Senate come up with a deal that can get the government open. And one of the things you could do is conservatives believe that they don't want the government to micromanage people's lives. And you know, everybody believes that people should have healthcare, and so why not take the people who have higher healthcare premiums and just mail them a check and let them decide? The reason why it could have an effect is that there are multiple tiers under the Affordable Care Act of different types of insurance, and it could be that people would rather have the money and go from like, you know, this kind of plan to that kind of plan and save themselves a little bit. And so that's, that's, you know, basically giving the people an opportunity to make more choices than the government usually lets them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this the Senator Cassidy proposal?",
      "HASSETT: I'm sure that Senator Cassidy and President Trump talked about it, but whether he agrees with everything that Cassidy- I haven't talked to him about it yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, does the Republican leader in the Senate accept--",
      "HASSETT: --The president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --this proposal?--",
      "HASSETT: -- the president started this idea yesterday, I don't think that it's been discussed widely in the Senate yet.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the president--",
      "HASSETT: It's the weekend.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The Senate's in session this weekend--",
      "HASSETT: --Yes, the Senate is in session this weekend and we are--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: because they're trying to end the shutdown--",
      "HASSETT: --And here I am.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But this is not the Republican Party's position.",
      "HASSETT: As of right now, it's not the Senate position, but the president thought it was something they should think about.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he seems to be negotiating before the government's open.",
      "HASSETT: He's talking to his colleagues in the Senate on the Republican side.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you would agree that there does need to be a deal on healthcare, that healthcare costs are too high.",
      "HASSETT: Well, I think that if you look at the Affordable Care Act, these premiums weren't made permanent by the Democrats during the COVID emergency because they're worried about the budgetary costs. And so if you look at the premium increases, they don't affect most people below two times the poverty line, three times the poverty line. But there are a lot of senior citizens that are above, like, around four times the poverty level, which with a husband and wife team would be about 120,000, that are seeing really big premium increases. And I think that everybody's going to want to think about what the next step for that would be, because are seeing- again most people aren't seeing much of an increase at all, but the maximum increases you're seeing could be up to about $500 a month for seniors who have really costly plans.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president has also been talking about affordability, and our CBS polling shows the president's approval rating on the economy has dipped to 38%, the lowest of this term. 75% of those polled say he's not focusing enough on lowering prices, but the president said this week Democrats are making it up and quote, \"every price is down.\" I'm sure you know the Consumer Price Index showed grocery prices are up nearly 3%, in September from a year ago.",
      "HASSETT: --well--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --Do you dispute that?",
      "HASSETT: Well, actually, let's go through the facts, right? Inflation went up about 5% under President Biden. In President Trump's first eight or nine months, depending where we get the last number, it's up 2.7%. One of the big things that's hurting affordability is mortgages. The interest rate went up by about 4%.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: This is grocery prices--",
      "HASSETT: --No, grocery prices are actually down significantly under Trump. But here's the thing--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --but depends on which--",
      "HASSETT: Let me-- I'll just make a point.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay.",
      "HASSETT: That if you look at the real reduction in spending power for Americans under Joe Biden, then it went down about $3,000 because we had up to 9% inflation, and then they went to the grocery store, they couldn't buy the things they're used to buying. The real spending power, adjusted for inflation, under President Trump has gone up about $1,200 so far this year. $1,200 is not $3,000, and so people are right to feel stretched, but we're making progress. And if you look at all the positive things about the economy, industrial production just about at an all time high, capital spending about at an all time high, GDP growth right now about 4%, then that shows that the income growth that we need to get more affordability is on the path to happening. And the bottom line is that the last Consumer Price Index surprised down. It was lower than expected, and it would have been even lower because there was a refinery shutdown that caused it to go slightly higher. So we see inflation under control and the economy booming, but we understand 100% why people are still hurting, because we haven't made up all the room that was lost under Joe Biden.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you comfortable with 3% inflation?",
      "HASSETT: I'm comfortable with 2% inflation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So no, you're not happy where things are now.",
      "HASSETT: Well, they got to go down a little bit more, but there- but the point is that inflation is like the Queen Mary, my friend Alan Greenspan used to say, so when you go from almost 4% that we had in January down to the mid twos, then that's a trajectory that usually has momentum.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So the St. Louis Fed found tariffs account for half a percentage point of the annual inflation rate. How much do you think the tariffs are hiking prices?",
      "HASSETT: You know, there's a couple of papers out there that say that prices went up by between two tenths and five tenths. And the thing to remember, if those papers are true, is that that's a level adjust, because the tariff goes in, and then the tariff is just there, so it doesn't affect inflation in the future. It would be a one time level adjust. Our estimates at CEA are much closer to zero, and it's all based on modeling and assumptions about elasticities and things. But for the most part, the one way you can see it is you could look at the price of imported goods, and the price of imported goods, CEA put a report out, has actually been declining under tariffs. Because what happens is that the Chinese want to sell us lots of stuff, and there's a tariff, so they cut their prices so that they can still have a larger market share in the US.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Kevin Hassett, always good to have you here. Of course, we have to leave it there for now. We'll be right back in a minute. Stay with us.",

      "Hamas said earlier Sunday that it had found Goldin's body in a tunnel in the enclave's southernmost city of Rafah on Saturday. Israel's military had long determined that he had been killed, based on evidence found in the tunnel where his body was taken in 2014, including a blood-soaked shirt and prayer fringes.",
      "The remains of four hostages who were taken during Hamas' terrorist attack on Oct. 7, 2023, are still in Gaza.",
      "The return of Goldin's remains is a significant development in the U.S.-brokered truce, which many fear has been faltering amidst the slow return of bodies of hostages and skirmishes between Israeli troops and militants in Gaza. It also closes a painful, 11-year saga for his family and in Israel, where Goldin has become a national symbol.",
      "At the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said that holding the body for so long has caused \"great agony of his family, which will now be able to give him a Jewish burial.\"",
      "Goldin's family spearheaded a very public campaign, along with the family of another soldier whose body was taken in 2014, to bring their sons home for burial. Israel recovered the remains of the other soldier, Oron Shaul, earlier this year.",
      "Netanyahu said that the government would continue trying to bring home the bodies of other Israelis killed while serving the country, including Eli Cohen, an Israeli spy hanged in Damascus in 1965, whose exploits were celebrated in 'The Spy', a 2019 television series.",
      "Israeli media, citing anonymous officials, had previously reported that Hamas was delaying the release of Goldin's body in hopes of negotiating safe passage for more than 100 militants surrounded by Israeli forces and trapped in the enclave's southernmost city of Rafah.",
      "Gila Gamliel, the minister of innovation, science and technology and a member of Netanyahu's Likud party, told Army Radio that Israel isn't negotiating for a deal within a deal.",

      "\"I did not know Itay in body, but I came to know him through the strength of those who loved him. His family's courage, their refusal to let this world forget him, became a beacon not only for myself, but for so many others worldwide,\"\u00a0 U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff said in a eulogy. \"They reminded us that even in the darkness, light is not extinguished. It waits to be carried by those who refuse to give up.\"",
      "Since the ceasefire began last month, militants have released the remains of 23 hostages. As part of the truce deal, the militants are expected to return all of the remains of hostages.",
      "For each Israeli hostage returned, Israel has been releasing the remains of 15 Palestinians. Ahmed Dheir, director of forensic medicine at Nasser Hospital in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, said that the remains of 300 have now been returned, with 89 identified.",

    "summary": "The biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with its 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters said.",
    "story": [
      "Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed ashore on Sunday in the northeastern coast of the Philippines, where the massive storm had already left at least two people dead and forced more than a million people to evacuate from flood- and landslide-prone areas, officials said.",
      "The typhoon blew into Dinalungan town in Aurora province Sunday night after setting off fierce rain and wind in northeastern Philippine provinces all day from offshore, with sustained winds of up to 115 mph and gusts of up to 143 mph.",
      "The biggest typhoon to threaten the Philippines in years, Fung-wong could cover two-thirds of the archipelago with its 1,118-mile-wide rain and wind band, forecasters said. It approached from the Pacific while the Philippines was still dealing with the devastation wrought by Typhoon Kalmaegi, which left at least 224 people dead in central provinces on Tuesday before pummelling Vietnam, where at least five were killed.",
      "A villager drowned in flash floods in the eastern province of Catanduanes and another died in Catbalogan city in eastern Samar province when she was hit by debris, officials said.",
      "Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has declared a state of emergency due to the extensive devastation caused by Kalmaegi and the expected calamity from Fung-wong, which is also called Uwan in the Philippines.",
      "Tropical cyclones with sustained winds of 185 kph (115 mph) or higher are categorized in the Philippines as a super typhoon, a designation adopted years ago to underscore the urgency tied to more extreme weather disturbances.",
      "'Zero visibility'",
      "\"The rain and wind were so strong there was nearly zero visibility,\" Roberto Monterola, a disaster-mitigation officer for Catanduanes, told The Associated Press by telephone.",
      "Despite calls for residents to evacuate on Saturday, some still stayed on.",
      "\"Our personnel rescued 14 people who were trapped on the roof of a house engulfed in flood in a low-lying neighborhood,\" Monterola said. \"A father also called in panic, saying the roof of his house was about to be ripped off by the wind. We saved him and four relatives.\"",
      "Over a million people were evacuated from high-risk villages in northeastern provinces, including in Bicol, a coastal region vulnerable to Pacific cyclones and mudflows from Mayon, one of the country's most active volcanoes.",
      "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. warned about the potentially catastrophic impact of Fung-wong in televised remarks Saturday. He said the storm could affect a vast expanse of the country, including Cebu, the central province hit hardest by the previous typhoon, and metropolitan Manila, the densely populated capital region.",
      "More than 30 million people could be exposed to hazards posed by Fung-wong, the Office of Civil Defense said.",
      "Teodoro asked people to follow government orders and seek shelter away from villages and towns prone to flash floods, landslides and coastal tidal surges. \"We need to do this because when it's already raining or the typhoon has hit and flooding has started, it's hard to rescue people,\" Teodoro said.",
      "Power cut in eastern towns",
      "The Philippines has not called for international help following the devastation caused by Kalmaegi, but Teodoro said the United States, the country's longtime treaty ally, and Japan were ready to provide assistance.",

      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel breaks down the latest American Heart Association data.",
      "A deep clean at the dentist may benefit more than just your oral health.",
      "In a two-year study of people with periodontitis or severe gum disease, researchers from University College London (UCL) found that those who got intensive treatment \u2014 a full-mouth deep cleaning with regular follow-ups \u2014 had slower thickening and clogging of a major neck artery and better blood-vessel function than those who only got routine cleanings.",
      "The randomized controlled trial tracked 135 adults at UCL\u2019s Eastman Dental Institute who had periodontitis, which can stem from poor oral hygiene, genetics, smoking or uncontrolled diabetes, according to the research published this month in the European Heart Journal.",
      "COMMON VIRUSES LINKED TO \u2018DRAMATIC\u2019 SPIKE IN HEART ATTACK AND STROKE RISK",
      "At 12 and 24 months, participants who received intensive deep cleanings showed less gum inflammation and fewer bacteria entering the bloodstream, and their arteries were healthier than those who got standard scale-and-polish care, which only removes plaque and tartar buildup.",
      "A new study found that deep dental cleanings could benefit heart health. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Marco Orlandi, co-author of the trial, said in a statement that the participants who received the intensive gum disease treatment had a 0.02 millimeter reduction in the thickening of their carotid arteries after two years.",
      "\"This is a significant result, as even a 0.01 millimeter reduction corresponds to a 10% decrease in cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting participants reduced their risk by around 10% each year,\" Orlandi said.",
      "Doctors track the thickness of the carotid artery wall as an early warning sign for clogged arteries that can lead to heart attacks and strokes. This study didn\u2019t count actual heart events, but the artery changes, along with lower gum inflammation, suggest that improved oral health could help fight cardiovascular disease.",
      "FRUIT-BASED INGREDIENT MAY HELP FIGHT GUM DISEASE NATURALLY, SCIENTISTS DISCOVER",
      "All participants were otherwise healthy and not taking regular medication, helping researchers isolate the effects of gum disease treatment.",
      "Researchers found that participants who received deep gum cleanings showed slower thickening of the carotid artery. (iStock)",
      "\"This is among the most robust evidence to date that oral and cardiovascular health are interconnected,\" Professor John Deanfield, lead author of the study and director of cardiovascular prevention at UCL, said in a statement. \"Addressing periodontitis could become a powerful tool in preventing serious heart and brain events such as heart attacks and strokes.\"",
      "Professor Francesco D'Aiuto, another of the study's co-authors, added that medical and dental professionals should work more closely in recognizing and addressing the cardiovascular implications of gum disease.",

      "Periodontitis affects about 40% of adults worldwide and can cause bleeding, swelling and tenderness of the gums and tooth loss if untreated.",
      "\"Your gums are part of your vascular system,\" Dr. Catrise Austin, a New York City cosmetic dentist and host of the \"Let\u2019s Talk Smiles\" podcast, told Fox News Digital. \"If they\u2019re inflamed and bleeding, your arteries feel it.\"",

      "\"Asking a simple question like, 'Do your gums bleed when you brush?' could help identify early signs of systemic inflammation long before more serious health issues arise,\" she said.",
      "For patients, she recommends brushing twice daily, flossing daily, getting regular professional cleanings, quitting smoking and managing conditions like diabetes.",
      "\"These steps not only protect your smile, they also lower inflammation that contributes to cardiovascular disease,\" Austin said.",
      "The study, supported by the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) and the NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Center in collaboration with University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, adds to a growing body of research linking gum health to overall well-being.",

      "The study measured carotid artery thickness, an early sign of heart disease. (iStock)",

      "During the interview, Attia shared some of his top strategies for not only living longer, but also remaining strong, healthy and engaged, so the last decade is as enjoyable and independent as possible.",
      "7 STEPS TO \u2018SUPER-AGING\u2019 ARE KEY TO LIVING A LONGER, MORE FULFILLING LIFE, EXPERTS SAY",
      "This is what experts refer to as \"healthspan\" \u2014 the period of life when one is free from \"age-associated maladies,\" according to Douglas E. Vaughan, M.D., director of the Potocsnak Longevity Institute at Northwestern University in Chicago.",

      "Below are the five strategies that Attia shared with \"60 Minutes.\"",
      "No. 1: Train like life is a sport",
      "Attia recommends approaching life \u2014 particularly in advanced age \u2014 like an athlete would approach a sport.",
      "As people age, their level of fitness, strength and mobility matters more than many traditional markers, he noted.",
      "7 COMMON FITNESS MISTAKES OLDER ADULTS MAKE AND HOW TO AVOID THEM FOR BETTER WORKOUTS",
      "The longevity expert said he logs about 10 hours per week of exercise \u2014 a mix of fat-burning cardio, high-intensity intervals (to boost VO\u2082 max), and strength training to maintain muscle.",
      "Attia said he alternates between \"zone two\" exercise, which entails steady cardio activity that allows you to maintain a conversation, and\u00a0higher-intensity \"zone four\" training.",
      "No. 2: Use meaningful tests \u2014 not just standard bloodwork",
      "Attia recommends closely tracking VO\u2082 max, which measures the maximum amount of oxygen the body uses during strenuous exercise.",
      "VO\u2082 max is usually measured in milliliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute (ml/kg/min).",
      "Longevity expert Dr. Peter Attia says most people experience a steep decline in their 70s \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u00a0 (Getty Images)",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure,\" Attia said. \"It predicts your risk of death from any cause, even more than your blood pressure, cholesterol or smoking status.\"",
      "\"I think this is the neglected part of medical testing, is how fit are you, how strong are you, how well do you move?\" he said. \"And in many ways, these tests are even more predictive of how long you're going to live than what I might get out of your bloodwork.\"",
      "\"Your VO2 max is more strongly correlated with your lifespan than any other metric I can measure.\"",
      "Attia also uses scans like DEXA (short for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), which measures bone density, muscle mass and body fat.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" he added.",
      "\"When you look at things like cardiorespiratory fitness, when you look at muscle mass, when you look at strength, they have a much higher association than things like even cholesterol and blood pressure,\" the doctor said. (iStock)",
      "Attia also is a proponent of full-body MRI scans, which can detect cancers and other conditions earlier for better outcomes, although he warns of the potential for false positives.",
      "He also recommends getting tested for APOE, the gene that indicates an elevated risk for Alzheimer's disease. Having one copy of the gene roughly doubles or triples the chances of developing the common dementia, while two copies raises the risk by 10 times and lowers the average age of onset by five to 10 years, data shows.",
      "No. 3: Eat more protein than standard guidelines suggest",
      "Boosting protein intake has been linked to increased muscle mass and strength, stronger immune function and reduced disease burden, studies show.",
      "Attia recommends consuming more than twice the protein recommended in current nutritional guidelines.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day, which would be 55 grams for a 150-pound person or 73 grams for a 200-pound person.",
      "No. 4: Prioritize emotional, mental and relational health",
      "Emotional and mental health are just as important as physical health, according to Attia.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"It\u2019s as much a practice as what I put into exercise, blood work and cancer screening,\" he said.",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia went on. \"But if we're being deliberate and active on our emotional health, it can actually improve.\"",
      "\"By working hard on our physical health, we can reduce the rate of decline,\" Attia said. \"But if we're being deliberate and active about our emotional health, it can actually improve.\" (Getty Images)",
      "The expert credits his wife of more than two decades for enabling his progress.",
      "\"Just like the exercise data, I don't think this is just a correlation,\" Attia said in the interview. \"I really think that there is also some causality that flows from the end of having great relationships to living a longer life.\"",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "Vaughan echoed that the common denominator in \"super agers\" involves a supportive community, a healthy social environment and regular contact with people who care for one another.",

      "No. 5: Optimize the \u2018marginal decade\u2019",
      "While decline is inevitable, Attia said his goal is to make what he calls the \"marginal decade\" as enjoyable as possible.",
      "\"The marginal decade's not going anywhere. We will all have a final decade of life,\" he said.",

      "A conservative student from Beloit College in Wisconsin says her school is blocking students from establishing a new Turning Point USA (TPUSA) club on campus and has failed to adequately protect its members from harassment and threats they have faced for trying to do so.",
      "On Oct. 1, Jocelyn Jordan and some of her classmates began applying to start a new Turning Point USA chapter at Beloit College, requiring them to find a faculty advisor, among a list of other requirements needed to start a club on campus.",
      "Every faculty member the students have asked thus far, including the dean of students, refused to help them, according to Jordan, who said she was advised to establish a group that does not have the Turning Point name attached to it. Jordan also claimed a member of the student government said that even if they were to find a faculty advisor, they still would not be able to establish a Turning Point chapter on campus.",
      "Meanwhile, Jordan and her classmates began promoting their club on social media around mid-October, leading to a harassment campaign targeting the students for their efforts to create a chapter of the Republican group, first founded by assassinated conservative activist Charlie Kirk, on their campus. The harassment initially included disturbing imagery posted on the group's new Instagram page, referring to Jordan and her co-founders as Nazis, Ku Klux Klan members and White supremacists, but eventually devolved into threats.",

      "However, Jordan said the university dismissed the students' initial harassment concerns, telling them there was nothing faculty could do because they could not identify who was making the harassing posts. When the harassment devolved into threats, Jordan filed a subsequent police report, a move that appeared to spur greater action from the college, which eventually banned one of the main harassers from campus, who Jordan said was an alumnus working in food service on campus at the time.",
      "\"As a student, I should feel comfortable coming to campus no matter what beliefs I have, no matter what I identify as, no matter who I want to be. And, at this moment, I don't feel comfortable,\" Jordan told Fox News Digital. \"I mean, it took three and a half weeks for [Beloit College] to even address the situation, and that doesn't give me much hope for how this is going to turn out for Turning Point.\"",

      "In addition to banning the alumnus from campus, the college also sent out an email, which Jordan described as \"vague\" and pointed out that it came after weeks of their complaints that fell on deaf ears, warning students about hateful rhetoric towards other students. The email did mention an incident of late that included \"the depiction of other Beloit students as dangerous radicals, Nazis, or monsters seeking to cause harm.\"",
      "\"I want to remind everyone that our Student Handbook states that social media harassment \u2026 is prohibited behavior,\" the email added. \"Engaging thoughtfully around difference is hard, but that's why you've come to Beloit: to learn to do hard things well and with compassion. So let's try this. Be kind to one another. Give the benefit of the doubt to other students.\"",
      "The harassment campaign targeting Jordan and her classmates was led in part by a now-deleted Instagram page titled \"bc_friendly_fan_edits,\" which posted a photo of the potential Turning Point board members at Beloit photoshopped around Charlie Kirk in a casket and Donald Trump on a cross. The same group also posted a sexualized depiction of a female Nazi with Jordan's face juxtaposed on it. The photo was captioned \"#bullythebigots.\"",

      "While Trump did not elaborate and clarify what reinstating nuclear testing would involve, Senate Democrats are seeking to put some limitations in place for the executive branch amid concerns that launching the first nuclear test in more than 30 years would prompt near-peer adversaries like China to follow.",
      "As a result, Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, D-N.M., and Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., introduced the No Nuclear Testing Without Approval Act Friday. The measure prohibits the U.S. from conducting a nuclear test unless a foreign state first conducts a nuclear test, and would require Congress to sign off on such nuclear tests.",

The area is now known as the Nevada National Security Site, which aims to safeguard the U.S.\u2019 nuclear weapons stockpile.",

      "\"Nevadans were blindsided when President Trump said he could revive the outdated, misguided practice of detonating nuclear weapons just 60 miles from my hometown of Las Vegas,\" Cortez Masto said in a Friday statement. \"No administration should have the authority to set off nuclear bombs on American soil without any oversight or outreach to the states that would bear the burden of these dangerous tests.\"",
      "Likewise, Rosen emphasized the gravity of resuming nuclear testing, and said that \"a decision of this magnitude should not be made lightly or on a whim by an erratic President.\"",

    "summary": "Fox News Digital spoke to Defending Education President Nicole Neily about the current state of DEI at U.S. universities and what needs to be done to combat it.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News Digital spoke to Defending Education President Nicole Neily about schools across the country continuing to hide their DEI efforts from federal scrutiny and what her group is doing about it.",
      "As universities across the country have been accused of trying to hide their diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts to avoid federal scrutiny, Fox News Digital spoke to a leading parents' rights activist about how serious the problem is and what can be done about it.",
      "\"I look at\u2026 the responses to the Trump administration and the executive orders falling into three buckets,\" Nicole Neily, founder and president of the nonpartisan grassroots organization Defending Education, told Fox News Digital about the continuation of DEI activities despite the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to eliminate it.",
      "Neily explained, \"The first bucket are the proud resisters. I put Princeton, Harvard, schools like that in that category, where they're just going to, you know, \u2018hashtag resist\u2019 and do their thing. The second bucket is, I think it's the biggest category, and I think they're the ones that are trying to put lipstick on a pig. They are renaming the departments. The DEI department is now the \u2018belonging department.\u2019 The coordinator, the DEI dean, is now compliance dean or something like that. But those people are doing the same damn thing and just trying to wait the Trump administration out.\"",
      "Fox News Digital has extensively reported on schools in the first two buckets as defined by Neily, including at Washington University in St. Louis, where one of the nation\u2019s top medical schools was accused of\u00a0moving the DEI office to a restricted floor rather than close it.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE CAMPUS RADICALS COAST TO COAST",
      "Combating DEI at all levels of education will require a \"whole of government\" approach, Nicole Neily told Fox News Digital. (Getty Images)",
      "Earlier this month, Princeton University was hit with a\u00a0scathing federal complaint over a DEI agenda that allegedly involved\u00a0female students sharing \"gender-neutral\" restrooms with gaps in the stalls, as well as graduations segregated by gender identity.",
      "At the\u00a0University of Utah and\u00a0University of Virginia, Fox News Digital reported on staffers being caught on hidden camera explaining their efforts to continue DEI efforts by simply rebranding or renaming them.",
      "\"The third category are the schools that actually want to comply in good faith,\" Neily told Fox News Digital. \"I think a lot of schools, a lot of administrators, got pretty frustrated with the excesses of the DEI movement, and they're secretly relieved that they now have a little bit of air cover to wind those programs back. And they might hand wring and do a little performative 'this is the orange man's fault,' but at the end of the day, I think they really are relieved.\"",
      "Neily told Fox News Digital that the \"second bucket\" is the \"biggest and most challenging category.\" She said she was recently at a university board conference where speakers on a DEI panel were openly calling for \"inclusivity work\" to be continued because the Trump administration \"only cares about\" Ivy League schools and \"they can\u2019t sue us all.\"",
      "UNIVERSITY DROPS JOB POSTING AFTER DEI REQUIREMENT EXPOSED, PROFESSOR SAYS \u2018I WOULD NOT BE HIRED\u2019 TODAY",
      "While many universities are resisting the Trump administration's crackdown on DEI programs, others are complying in good faith. (iStock)",
      "\"To me, that demonstrates real mens rea, which is Latin for a guilty mind,\" Neily said. \"I think that shows that these people are the real evildoers and those are the ones where I think, obviously, the Trump administration has spent a lot of time over the past few months going after Harvard, going after Columbia, like the real bad actors that are out there trying to, you know that clearly have to be cleaned up. But I think that there is a much more significant and long-term effort to uproot and eradicate the DEI that is just trying to hide in plain sight. And I think that's a really, really important mission.\"",
      "Defending Education recently sent a letter,\u00a0first reported by Fox News Digital, to elected officials in all 50 states calling for a top-to-bottom audit of state laws at the K-12 level to ensure that no loopholes are being exploited, allowing schools to continue DEI efforts.",
      "Combating DEI at all levels of education will require a \"whole of government\" approach, Neily told Fox News Digital, adding that it will be important to not let administrators \"whitewash their records\" or pass the blame onto someone else for policies they have supported.",
      "Additionally, Neily expressed optimism that the tide is turning against DEI in terms of popularity.",
      "\"I think we're at a moment where there is kind of a perfect storm taking place in academia. This incoming freshman class this year is the largest freshman class that American universities will ever have\u2026 Clearly, we have seen polling over the past couple years demonstrate a massive loss in public confidence in the institutions of higher education at a time when costs are through the roof, the return on investment for sending your child to some of these schools is horrible. So I think a lot of people are really rethinking, is this the correct track for me, period?\" Neily said.",
      "UNIVERSITY DOCTOR RESIGNS AFTER UNEARTHED AUDIO EXPOSES HIM BOASTING ABOUT SKIRTING ANTI-DEI LAWS",
      "\"We also have fewer international students coming in, thanks to the efforts of the Trump administration, and so I think what we're gonna see over the next several years is a number of universities that actually start to close. And how do those schools differentiate themselves in the marketplace?\"",
      "Neily said she has witnessed students \"vote with their feet\" and choose to attend schools that don\u2019t promote \"woke\" ideologies, particularly in the South as students are looking for a \"proper college experience.\"",
      "Earlier this year,\u00a0Fox News Digital reported that\u00a0several Southern states banded together to establish their own accrediting body for higher education in order to \"upend the monopoly of the woke accreditation cartels.\"",

      "\"They don't wanna be surrounded by a bunch of pearl-clutching Victorian scolds that are going to reprimand them for using the wrong pronouns and for not wearing masks in the middle of the winter, and so we're watching people and some of those state schools in the South now, realizing, OK, we can get more out-of-state students coming in, paying higher out-of-state tuition,\" Neily said.",
      "\"But it's also changing and altering what our campus life is like, and so we're also, from constituents in the South, they're now pushing for their in-state universities to put caps actually in the number of out-of-state students. And so, this is very much a kind of evolving landscape, but I think that there is a lot more change coming ahead in higher education. And for those higher ed administrators who have not started to really look in the mirror and think, what do we wanna be when we grow up? I think they're gonna be in for a world of hurt soon.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 07:36:45 -0500",
    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This\u00a0PLOS Climate study reinforces that after the first two years, EVs deliver real and lasting climate benefits. As the U.S. grid shifts toward cleaner energy, its impact grows even stronger. The authors note that the analysis does not include emissions from recycling or charging infrastructure, yet it remains one of the most thorough long-term views of EV adoption and its effects on the economy and environment.",

      "Waabi integrates its Waabi Driver with Volvo\u2019s VNL Autonomous, signaling a push toward safe, scalable Level 4 trucking. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "How this AI-powered autonomous truck was built for scale",
      "In early 2025, Waabi and Volvo Autonomous Solutions announced a long-term partnership to develop and deploy autonomous trucks.",
      "Volvo's New River Valley plant in Virginia is producing the VNL Autonomous with six critical redundant or back-up systems \u2014 including dual braking, steering, communication, computing, power, energy storage and motion control \u2014 which are key to safe operations without a driver in the seat.",
      "Waabi provides the Waabi Driver, an end-to-end AI model that learns from experience and adapts to new conditions. The company also uses its advanced simulator, Waabi World, to expose the AI to millions of realistic driving situations before it reaches the road. Waabi calls this approach \"physical AI,\" which allows it to generalize across different environments safely.",
      "\"The future of autonomous trucking depends on technology that is safe, scalable, and built for customer needs,\" said Raquel Urtasun, Founder and CEO of Waabi.\u00a0\"Together with Volvo and NVIDIA, we're leading autonomous freight into a safer and more efficient era.\"",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "Volvo\u2019s New River Valley plant builds the VNL Autonomous with six redundant systems to enable driverless operations. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",
      "Why the AI-powered autonomous truck matters for freight",
      "The U.S. freight market continues to face growing demand and a shortage of qualified drivers. AI-powered autonomous trucks offer one of the most promising solutions to keep goods moving. By integrating the self-driving technologies of partners like Aurora Innovation and Waabi into the Volvo VNL Autonomous on the pilot line at its New River Facility in Virginia, Volvo Autonomous Solutions is able to deliver autonomous trucks with OEM-grade quality and consistency.",
      "Nils Jaeger, President of Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said the partnership is helping build the broader ecosystem needed for commercial deployment.",
      "\"Autonomy has the potential to address some of the biggest challenges in the transport industry, including safety, efficiency and capacity,\" he said.",
      "The collaboration also draws strength from NVIDIA's computing platform.",
      "\"Self-driving is one of the first frontiers in which we will see physical AI become a reality,\" said Rishi Dhall, Vice President of Automotive at NVIDIA.\u00a0\"Our purpose-built compute platform complements Waabi's pioneering end-to-end verifiable trucking system, and it's coming to life on the VNL Autonomous. Level 4 autonomy in trucking is happening now.\"",
      "Concerns and challenges facing AI-powered trucks",
      "Despite the excitement, driverless freight faces real challenges. Safety remains the top concern as trucks encounter unpredictable weather, road debris and human drivers. While simulation can prepare AI for millions of events, regulators are still defining how to certify systems for nationwide deployment.",
      "The shift toward automation also raises economic questions. Trucking employs millions of drivers across the United States, and experts predict that job roles will evolve as fleets adopt autonomous systems. Labor groups and state officials are calling for retraining programs to help workers transition into new positions that support automation.",
      "Data privacy and cybersecurity are growing priorities, too. These trucks depend on constant cloud connectivity, which makes them potential targets for hackers.",
      "Public perception could also influence how fast adoption moves. Many people like the idea of innovation but hesitate to share the road with fully autonomous vehicles. Building trust will require transparency, safety trials and a strong performance record on open highways.",
      "THE ROAD TO PROSPERITY WILL BE PAVED BY\u00a0AUTONOMOUS\u00a0TRUCKING",
      "Volvo and Waabi say their integrated platform targets broad commercial deployment as U.S. freight demand grows. (Silas Stein/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "What comes next for the AI-powered autonomous truck",
      "Volvo and Waabi have already completed the integration of the Waabi Driver with the Volvo VNL Autonomous. The companies describe this milestone as a key step toward Level 4 autonomous operation, meaning the truck will be able to drive itself without human intervention under defined conditions.",
      "This collaboration builds on Volvo Group Venture Capital's early investment in Waabi in 2023 and its later participation in Waabi's $200 million Series B funding round in 2024. That support helped set the stage for this integration and for future broad commercial deployment.",
      "Shahrukh Kazmi, Chief Product Officer at Volvo Autonomous Solutions, said Waabi's technology fits perfectly into Volvo's platform.",
      "\"We are excited to integrate Waabi's cutting-edge system into our autonomous truck and jointly develop a safe, efficient, and scalable transport solution,\" he said.",
      "What this means to you",
      "If you depend on deliveries or shop online, driverless freight could soon shape how products reach your home. These AI-powered trucks can operate longer hours than human drivers, reducing shipping delays and potentially lowering transportation costs.",
      "Automation could also make highways safer by cutting down on fatigue-related crashes. With fewer disruptions from freight incidents, travel may become smoother for everyone sharing the road.",
      "This collaboration highlights how artificial intelligence is moving from theory to production lines and changing the way goods move across America.",

If you're redirected to a CAPTCHA on an unfamiliar site or after clicking a suspicious link, stop immediately. Real CAPTCHAs usually appear only on trusted websites, not random pop-ups or login pages. When in doubt, close the page and verify the URL before taking any action.",

Since the \"Robot\" malware evolves rapidly, behavior-based detection helps stop new variants before signature updates are available. Enable automatic updates and schedule daily scans to catch infections early. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Communities from coast to coast may soon face the same discussions about safety, surveillance and trust that Miami residents are having today. People will need to decide what balance they want between innovation and privacy and how technology should support public safety.",
      "As the pilot continues, community participation will matter more than ever. Residents, civic leaders and advocacy groups can shape how this technology develops by speaking up about clear rules, fair data use and transparency. The results from Miami-Dade could influence how police departments nationwide use automation in the years ahead.

      "Why you and others are targets",
      "Banks are trusted institutions, and scammers know it. That trust makes impersonation one of the easiest and most effective fraud tactics today. With\u00a0spoofing tools, criminals can mimic real bank phone numbers and even use AI to reproduce familiar voices. Their approach is psychological: they create panic and urgency to make victims act quickly and irrationally.",

The FTC found that losses of over $100,000 to impostor scams among people aged 60 and older have skyrocketed, from $55 million in 2020 to $445 million in 2024.

      "What's the deal with the proposed GUARD Act?",
      "Here are some of the key features of the proposed Guard Act:",
      "AI companies would be required to\u00a0verify user age with \"reasonable age-verification measures\" (for example, a government ID) rather than simply asking for a birthdate.If a user is found to be under 18, a company must\u00a0prohibit them from accessing an \"AI companion.\"The bill also mandates that\u00a0chatbots clearly disclose they are\u00a0not human and do not hold professional credentials (therapy, medical, legal) in every conversation.It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",

      "It creates new\u00a0criminal and civil penalties for companies that knowingly provide chatbots to minors that solicit or facilitate sexual content, self-harm or violence.",
      "Bipartisan lawmakers, including Senators Josh Hawley and Richard Blumenthal, introduced the GUARD Act to protect minors from unregulated AI chatbots. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The motivation: lawmakers cite testimony of parents, child welfare experts and growing lawsuits alleging that some chatbots manipulated minors, encouraged self-harm or worse. The basic framework of the GUARD Act is clear, but the details reveal how extensive its reach could be for tech companies and families alike.",
      "META AI DOCS EXPOSED, ALLOWING CHATBOTS TO FLIRT WITH KIDS",
      "Why is this such a big deal?",
      "This bill is more than another piece of tech regulation. It sits at the center of a growing debate over how far artificial intelligence should reach into children's lives.",
      "AI chatbots are no longer toys. Many kids are using them. Hawley cited\u00a0more than 70 percent of American children\u00a0engaging with these products. These chatbots can provide human-like responses, emotional mimicry and sometimes invite ongoing conversations. For minors, these interactions can blur boundaries between machine and human, and they may seek guidance or emotional connection from an algorithm rather than a real person.",
      "If this bill passes, it could reshape how the AI industry manages minors, age verification, disclosures and liability. It shows that Congress is ready to move away from voluntary self-regulation and toward firm guardrails when children are involved. The proposal may also open the door for similar laws in other high-risk areas, such as mental health bots and educational assistants. Overall, it marks a shift from waiting to see how AI develops to acting now to protect young users.",
      "Parents across the country are calling for stronger safeguards as more than 70 percent of children use AI chatbots that can mimic empathy and emotional support. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Some tech companies argue that such regulation could stifle innovation, limit beneficial uses of conversational AI (education, mental-health support for older teens) or impose heavy compliance burdens. This tension between safety and innovation is at the heart of the debate.",
      "What the GUARD Act requires from AI companies",
      "If passed, the GUARD Act would impose strict federal standards on how AI companies design, verify and manage their chatbots, especially when minors are involved. The bill outlines several key obligations aimed at protecting children and holding companies accountable for harmful interactions.",
      "The first major requirement centers on\u00a0age verification. Companies must use reliable methods such as government-issued identification or other proven tools to confirm that a user is at least 18 years old. Simply asking for a birthdate is no longer enough.The second rule involves\u00a0clear disclosures. Every chatbot must tell users at the start of each conversation, and at regular intervals, that it is an artificial intelligence system, not a human being. The chatbot must also clarify that it does not hold professional credentials such as medical, legal or therapeutic licenses.Another provision establishes an\u00a0access ban for minors. If a user is verified as under 18, the company must block access to any \"AI companion\" feature that simulates friendship, therapy or emotional communication.The bill also introduces\u00a0civil and criminal penalties for companies that violate these rules. Any chatbot that encourages or engages in sexually explicit conversations with minors, promotes self-harm or incites violence could trigger significant fines or legal consequences.Finally, the GUARD Act defines an\u00a0AI companion as a system designed to foster interpersonal or emotional interaction with users, such as friendship or therapeutic dialogue. This definition makes it clear that the law targets chatbots capable of forming human-like connections, not limited-purpose assistants.",

      "OHIO LAWMAKER PROPOSES COMPREHENSIVE BAN ON MARRYING AI SYSTEMS AND GRANTING LEGAL PERSONHOOD",
      "How to stay safe in the meantime",
      "Technology often moves faster than laws, which means families, schools and caregivers must take the lead in protecting young users right now. These steps can help create safer online habits while lawmakers debate how to regulate AI chatbots.",
      "Start by finding out which chatbots your kids talk to and what those bots are designed for. Some are made for entertainment or education, while others focus on emotional support or companionship. Understanding each bot's purpose helps you spot when a tool crosses from harmless fun into something more personal or manipulative.",
      "Even if a chatbot is labeled safe, decide together when and how it can be used. Encourage open communication by asking your child to show you their chats and explain what they like about them. Framing this as curiosity, not control, builds trust and keeps the conversation ongoing.",
      "Take advantage of built-in safety features whenever possible. Turn on parental controls, activate kid-friendly modes and block apps that allow private or unmonitored chats. Small settings changes can make a big difference in reducing exposure to harmful or suggestive content.",
      "Remind kids that even the most advanced chatbot is still software. It can mimic empathy, but does not understand or care in a human sense. Help them recognize that advice about mental health, relationships or safety should always come from trusted adults, not from an algorithm.",
      "Stay alert for changes in behavior that could signal a problem. If a child becomes withdrawn, spends long hours chatting privately with a bot or repeats harmful ideas, step in early. Talk openly about what is happening, and if necessary, seek professional help.",
      "Regulations such as the GUARD Act and new state measures, including California's SB 243, are still taking shape. Keep up with updates so you know what protections exist and which questions to ask app developers or schools. Awareness is the first line of defense in a fast-moving digital world.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The GUARD Act represents a bold step toward regulating the intersection of minors and AI chatbots. It reflects growing concern that unmoderated AI companionship might harm vulnerable users, especially children. Of course, regulation alone won't solve all problems, industry practices, platform design, parental involvement and education all matter. But this bill signals that the era of \"build it and see what happens\" for conversational AI may be ending when children are involved. As technology continues to evolve, our laws and our personal practices must evolve too. For now, staying informed, setting boundaries and treating chatbot interactions with the same scrutiny we treat human ones can make a real difference.",
      "If a law like the GUARD Act becomes reality, should we expect similar regulation for all emotional AI tools aimed at kids (tutors, virtual friends, games) or are chatbots fundamentally different? Let us know by writing to us at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",

    "summary": "Nebraska felon released under Biden clemency program arrested iafter Omaha shooting, sparking debate over criminal justice reform and public safety concerns nationwide.",
    "story": [
      "Criminal justice expert Michael Rushford breaks down how a felon\u2019s recent gun-related arrest is intensifying questions about leniency and public safety.",
      "A Nebraska felon whose prison sentence was reduced under a Biden administration clemency initiative is accused of possessing a gun linked to multiple crimes, intensifying scrutiny over whether reform efforts have come at the expense of public safety.",
      "Federal prosecutors say 31-year-old Khyre Holbert, who had served roughly seven years of a 20-year federal sentence for gun and narcotics offenses, was arrested after an Oct. 4 shooting in Omaha\u2019s Old Market district.",
      "Investigators allege Holbert discarded a loaded handgun fitted with a high-capacity magazine as officers closed in, a weapon later tied to several other violent crimes across Nebraska.",
      "Holbert\u2019s sentence had been commuted in January 2025 despite objections from the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, which warned of his gang ties, long criminal record and prior weapons convictions. Months later, he\u2019s accused of reoffending and his case has thrust former President Joe Biden\u2019s clemency program back into the national spotlight.",
      "TOP BIDEN OFFICIALS QUESTIONED AND CRITICIZED HOW HIS TEAM ISSUED PARDONS, USED AUTOPEN: REPORT",
      "Officials say Khyre Holbert, who was charged in a shooting in Omaha's Old Market earlier this month, now faces a federal firearms charge. (Omaha Police Department)",
      "Law enforcement groups have echoed that concern. The Omaha Police Officers Association blasted the decision to release Holbert, calling him \"no stranger to the law,\" while Attorney General Pamela Bondi described the case as \"a failure to hold criminals accountable.\"",
      "For Michael Rushford, founder and president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, Holbert\u2019s arrest is more than a tragedy. It\u2019s a warning.",
      "\"I don\u2019t think you can delegate clemency,\" Rushford told Fox News Digital. \"It was never intended that a president delegate that authority. I think what we saw were clemencies being granted without the president\u2019s direct knowledge. Why would he sign off on 31 drug dealers? Why would you sign off on a murderer?\"",
      "Rushford said cases like Holbert\u2019s reflect a failure in judgment and vetting during Biden\u2019s final year in office.",
      "\"With drug traffickers, especially those already convicted, this isn\u2019t their first party. It\u2019s hard to get into federal prison,\" he said. \"When you let one go, you have to realize he\u2019s going to go out and commit more crimes. The likelihood is very high. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me.\"",

      "He questioned whether Biden\u2019s Justice Department properly reviewed who was being released.",
      "\"You have to look and see if there was a real injustice in the case,\" Rushford said. \"With the Biden administration, I\u2019m not sure that was done. The Justice Department under him was not really interested in fighting crime.\"",
      "The concern extends beyond Nebraska. In March 2025, authorities in Alabama arrested Willie Frank Peterson, another Biden clemency recipient, on new drug- and gun-related charges, just months after his release.",
      "According to a federal complaint, Peterson, who had served more than a decade of a 20-year sentence, was caught with cocaine, meth and a loaded handgun. His sentence was also commuted in Biden\u2019s Jan. 17, 2025 clemency wave, which freed 2,490 inmates, mostly for drug and gun offenses, according to the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney.",
      "Rushford said that by the time offenders reach federal prison, most have already exhausted their \"second chances.\"",
      "BIDEN\u2019S AUTO-PEN PARDONS DISTURBED DOJ BRASS, DOCS SHOW, RAISING QUESTIONS WHETHER THEY ARE LEGALLY BINDING",
      "\"It\u2019s hard to get into federal prison,\" he explained. \"You don\u2019t just commit one crime and go, unless it\u2019s murder. Second chances have been overblown. By the time you get somebody who\u2019s got three or four convictions, the second chances are over.\"",
      "He said clemency should be narrowly used to correct genuine injustices and not as a political gesture.",
      "\"It\u2019s got to be a very specific process evaluating who\u2019s in there,\" Rushford said. \"If there was an injustice, fine. But it shouldn\u2019t be for political allies or people who gave you money. And I think that was happening under Biden.\"",
      "\"The people approving these releases,\" he added, \"weren\u2019t interested in protecting the public from criminals.\"",
      "Rushford said he expects the current administration to restore integrity to the clemency process.",
      "TED CRUZ TORCHES BIDEN FOR 'PARTISAN AND PERSONAL MOTIVES' AFTER BOMBSHELL REPORT ON AUTOPEN PARDONS",
      "\"I don\u2019t see the kind of straight criminals being let loose like Biden had done,\" he said. \"I hope the Trump Justice Department raises the integrity level and makes sure we\u2019re not letting out hardened criminals and drug traffickers.\"",
      "\"The president we have now knows what\u2019s going on,\" Rushford added. \"He has a Justice Department that\u2019s very engaged in fighting crime and reducing drug trafficking. It\u2019s a different regime making those decisions.\"",
      "Beyond clemency, Rushford blames a broader political climate that he says favors offenders over victims.",
      "\"The defund-the-police movement was an admission that they didn\u2019t want to protect the public \u2013 that their sympathies were with criminals,\" he said. \"There\u2019s a large segment of the political environment that doesn\u2019t agree criminals belong in prison.\"",
      "Rushford added that some major cities still have mayors and governors that think counselors will solve the problem.",

      "\"We still have mayors and governors in big cities that think we should send counselors to talk to criminals who are beating their wives with a broom handle \u2014 and that\u2019s ridiculous,\" he said. \"You need police officers to go in there and take that guy out and arrest him.\"",
      "Rushford said that attitude, combined with policies allowing repeat offenders back onto the streets, has eroded public trust and endangered communities.",
      "Rushford believes real reform only comes after tragedy.",
      "\"The last time around, one of the big triggers was Polly Klaas,\" he said. \"When they found the repeat offender who kidnapped and killed her, everybody said, \u2018We\u2019ve got to stop this.\u2019 I hate to say this, but I think it's going to be one of those horrible cases before the country wakes up.\"",
      "A California judge rejected convicted killer Richard Allen Davis' request for a resentencing hearing for his death-penalty sentence after murdering Polly Klaas in 1993. (Paul Sakuma, File/ Klaas for Kids)",
      "The 1993 murder of 12-year-old Polly Klaas, kidnapped from a sleepover in Petaluma, California, by a repeat offender, led to California\u2019s \"three-strikes\" law and remains one of the state\u2019s most infamous cases.",
      "Rushford also cited recent tragedies involving repeat offenders, including Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old UCLA graduate student fatally stabbed while working in a Hancock Park furniture store by a man with a lengthy record, and Iryna Zarutska, a woman who was murdered on a North Carolina train, allegedly by an ex-convict with a lengthy criminal history.",
      "Shawn Laval Smith, 34, was convicted for the 2022 killing of Brianna Kupfer, 24, who was stabbed multiple times while working alone in a Los Angeles furniture shop. (KTTV/Linkedin)",
      "Rushford said these cases show \"what happens when repeat offenders keep getting another chance.\"",
      "He believes the tide is turning but says it won\u2019t happen fast.",
      "\"It didn\u2019t come this way overnight, and it\u2019s going to take a while to get rid of it,\" Rushford said. \"People who are victimized by these repeat offenders, they're not going to be comforted by the fact that in 20 years, we're going to get this straightened out.\"",

      "With two clemency recipients, in Nebraska and Alabama, now back in custody, Rushford said the question isn\u2019t whether mercy has a place in justice, but whether the system can survive when mercy replaces accountability.",

    "summary": "The president, whose staff explored ways to skirt a law requiring backpay for federal workers after the shutdown ends, insisted \"they all knew the money is coming.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on his criticism of air traffic controllers who have been absent during parts of the record-long government shutdown, when they're required to work without pay.",
      "During a Fox News interview, Trump roundly dismissed the employees who in some cases have had to take on second jobs to pay their bills amid a funding lapse that will hit the six-week mark on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cYou know, a lot of people who showed up also had a second job. They took a second job temporarily. But they all know the money\u2019s coming, and the money was coming,\" Trump told host Laura Ingraham.",
      "Air traffic controllers are classified as essential government workers, meaning they must show for work during a shutdown, even though they're not getting paid. Members of the military, who are also essential workers, have received paychecks during the funding lapse.",
      "Trump has been inconsistent in recent remarks about backpay for federal employees when the government reopens.",
      "He said last month that \u201cit depends who we\u2019re talking about,\u201d when asked whether he supported back pay for federal employees, and that there \u201care some people that really don\u2019t deserve to be taken care of, and we\u2019ll take care of them in a different way.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration has also explored ways to prevent furloughed workers from getting back pay, despite a 2019 federal law requiring back pay, including through a draft memo last month that White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said did not entitle federal workers to retroactive pay.",
      "The memo appeared to contradict the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s earlier guidance which indicated that in the event of a shutdown, federal workers would be paid for any lapses in pay.",
      "Trump\u2019s comments Monday on Fox News came after he urged air traffic controllers in a social media post earlier in the day to return to work, days after the Federal Aviation Administration began canceling flights at dozens of major U.S. airports in a move that officials said was intended offset staffing shortages.",
      "Trump threatened to dock the pay of those who didn\u2019t report to work, while saying that he would recommend $10,000 bonuses for those who hadn\u2019t been absent during the shutdown.",
      "\u201cFor those that did nothing but complain, and took time off, even though everyone knew they would be paid, IN FULL, shortly into the future, I am NOT HAPPY WITH YOU,\u201d Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "He reiterated that sentiment on Fox News, saying, \"I want to reward the people that showed up without a lot of nonsense, without a lot of talk.\u201d",
      "\"They did their job and in many cases, they worked longer hours to get us through this period,\" Trump added.",
      "Asked how he would pay the bonuses, Trump said: \"I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll get it from some place.\"",
      "More broadly, Trump dismissed growing concerns about the economy among voters. After declaring that \"the economy is the strongest it's ever been,\" Ingraham asked Trump why people are saying they're anxious about the economy.",
      "\"I don't know what they are saying,\" Trump responded. \"I think polls are fake. We have the greatest economy we've ever had.\"",
      "A recent NBC News poll found that about two-thirds of respondents nationwide said Trump hasn't delivered on his promises to curb inflation and improve the economy.",
      "The president also weighed in on the legal fight over funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, saying the program \"really puts the company, the country, in jeopardy.\"",
      "He then expressed disdain for \"able-bodied people\" whom he claimed were leaving their jobs to obtain SNAP benefits.",
      "\"People that need it have to get it. I'm all for it, but people that are able-bodied, can do a job, they leave their job because they figure they can pick this up, it's easier,\" Trump said. \"That's not the purpose of it.\"",
      "The Trump administration on Monday filed a supplemental Supreme Court briefing seeking to extend a pause imposed last week to block full federal funding of food assistance program\u2019s benefits to its roughly 42 million recipients.",
      "The Senate passed a bill Monday night to reopen the government, with a provision that would ensure SNAP benefits are available through next September. The measure now heads to the House."

      "And 3,756 of those cancellations were between Nov. 7 and Nov. 9, when the FAA mandated flight reductions at 40 \"high traffic\" airports because there weren't enough controllers in the towers.",

      "Nick Daniels, president of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, who has steadfastly defended the controllers through the crisis, called his members \"unsung heroes\" during a news conference Monday.",
      "\u201cThey are doing everything they can to hold this system together and be out there serving the American public during these trying times. Forty-one days without pay is unacceptable,\u201d Daniels said. \u201cAir traffic controllers should not be the political pawn during a government shutdown.\u201d",
      "Responding to Trump's post, Daniels said: \"I\u2019ll take anything that recognizes these hard-working men and women, but we\u2019ll work with the administration on any issues that are out there.\"",
      "\"Air traffic controllers will continue to show up during this shutdown,\" he said. \"They\u2019ve endured the longest shutdown in American history, and every single day they absolutely, not only deserve their pay, they deserve to be recognized for what\u2019s going on, so we\u2019ll work with the administration through it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The families of six children and two counselors killed in a flooding disaster that struck a Texas summer camp for girls in July filed two separate lawsuits Monday against the camp\u2019s owners and others, alleging negligence.",
      "Twenty-seven children and counselors died in the July disaster in Kerr County, which was caused by slow-moving thunderstorms. More than 100 people died overall.",
      "The two suits say the camp was located in a known flash flood area along the Guadalupe River. Lawyers for the families of five of the children and two counselors said it was \"in a region known as \u2018Flash Flood Alley.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cCamp Mystic has long operated in a high-risk flood zone. Despite this known danger, the petition asserts that the camp failed to adopt legally required evacuation plans, ignored repeated weather warnings, and implemented unsafe policies,\u201d attorneys for the plaintiffs said.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges camp staff prioritized protecting equipment rather than the lives of campers and counselors.",
      "\"With the river rising, the Camp chose to direct its groundskeepers to spend over an hour evacuating camp equipment, not its campers and counselors,\" the suit says, adding that campers and counselors in two cabins were ordered to stay put even as others had been moved to higher ground 300 feet away.",
      "\"Finally, when it was too late, the Camp made a hopeless 'rescue' effort from its self-created disaster in which 25 campers, two counselors, and the Camp director died,\" the suit says.",
      "Jeff Ray, a lawyer for Camp Mystic, in a statement to NBC Dallas-Fort Worth Monday said that the magnitude of the flooding was unexpected. He said there was \"misinformation\" in the suits about the actions of Camp Mystic and Dick Eastland, the camp's owner and director, who also died.",
      "\"We intend to demonstrate and prove that this sudden surge of floodwaters far exceeded any previous flood in the area by several magnitudes, that it was unexpected and that no adequate warning systems existed in the area,\" Ray said.",
      "The family of another child who was killed, 8-year-old Eloise \u201cLulu\u201d Peck, filed a separate lawsuit Monday against Camp Mystic and others.",
      "The suit alleges owners of the camp, which it says has been in the family for generations, knew as far back as 1932 that cabins \"sat in the bullseye of potential flood waters from the Guadalupe River and never said a word about it to trusting parents.\" Since that time, the suit says, the owners had been playing \"Russian Roulette with the lives of the little girls.\"",
      "The lawsuit, filed by Eloise's parents Timothy and Melissa Peck, seeks unspecified damages in excess of $1 million for wrongful death, mental pain and anguish and other causes.",
      "\u201cThere is no greater trust than when a parent entrusts the care of their child to another. Parents don\u2019t send their children to summer camp to die,\u201d they said in the lawsuit.",
      "Camp Mystic \u201cand the people who ran it betrayed that trust,\u201d they said.",
      "During the early morning hours of July 4, the Guadalupe River in Kerr County rose over 20 feet in just a few hours, the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration has said.",
      "The Texas counties affected by the flash flooding had been experiencing drought since late 2021, the agency said. Drought conditions raise the risk that heavy rain will cause flash flooding because it hardens soils.",
      "The remnants of Tropical Storm Barry, which had hit southeastern Mexico on June 29, had a circulation that merged with a trough and moisture from the Eastern Pacific to cause the thunderstorms, NASA has said.",
      "Those factors created \"a large, organized cluster of thunderstorms that remained nearly stationary over the Texas Hill Country from July 4 to 7,\" NASA said. Around 11 inches fell in a few hours, and more than 20 inches fell in some areas overall.",
      "More than 130 people died in the floods across six counties, according to a count of official reports conducted by NBC News. At least 117 died in Kerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, the county government said in August. Two people remained missing as of Aug. 8.",
      "Camp Mystic said it plans to partially reopen next year with a monument to the victims.",
      "\u201cOur clients are devastated by the loss of Lulu,\" Randy R. Howry, lawyer for the Pecks, said in a statement. \"It was a terrible tragedy that could have been avoided. Camp Mystic must be held accountable for their failure to take care of Lulu and her friends.\u201d"

      "The music executive, meanwhile, is currently in a nine-person room in a large unit that houses 200 people, Engelmayer said.",
      "Combs has restarted \"Free Game with Diddy,\" an entrepreneurial class to help other inmates become entrepreneurs, value their self-worth and become productive citizens, Engelmayer said. Combs ran the program while he was at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, he said.",

      "Some LGBTQ activists have pointed to conservative Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019 suggestion in his concurring opinion in the decision overturning Roe that Obergefell and some other cases should also be revisited as a cause for concern.",
      "Although the court has a 6-3 conservative majority, none of the other justices joined Thomas\u2019 opinion.",
      "Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel, a conservative legal organization representing Davis, said in a statement that he would continue efforts to overturn Obergefell.",
      "\"Like the abortion decision in Roe v. Wade, Obergefell was egregiously wrong from the start. This opinion has no basis in the constitution,\" he added.",
      "The Supreme Court's action was welcomed by LGBTQ advocates.",
      "\"Today, the Supreme Court affirmed what we all know: marriage equality is the law of the land,\" Kevin Jennings, CEO of Lambda Legal, said in a statement.",
      "Just last month, Justice Samuel Alito, who authored the abortion ruling, indicated he was not pushing for Obergefell to be overturned.",
      "Davis refused to issue any marriage licenses in the immediate aftermath of the Obergefell decision. She said that as a conservative Christian who opposed same-sex marriage, she should have a religious right not to put her name on marriage licenses involving same-sex couples.",
      "Her office in Rowan County, Kentucky, denied licenses to several such couples, including David Moore and David Ermold, who subsequently filed a civil rights lawsuit.",
      "Davis was ordered to issue a license for Moore and Ermold, but defied the court injunction and still refused to do so. The judge then held her in contempt, and she was jailed for six days.",
      "While she was jailed, Moore and Ermold were able to obtain their marriage license.",
      "Subsequently, the state changed the law in order to address the controversy, allowing for a license to be issued without the clerk\u2019s name on it.",
      "But Davis\u2019 case continued, with Moore and Ermold seeking damages for the initial refusal.",
      "After lengthy litigation, a jury awarded $100,000 in damages. Davis was also required to pay $260,000 in attorney\u2019s fees, according to her lawyers.",
      "Davis then appealed, claiming that she should have been able to cite as a defense her right to the free exercise of religion under the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment.",
      "After losing an appeal at the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in March this year, Davis turned to the Supreme Court, raising that question, as well as the much more contentious issue of whether Obergefell should be overturned.",
      "With the Supreme Court appeal now over, the case will return to the lower court where Moore and Ermold, who declined to comment on the latest action in the case, will seek to collect the damages they are owed.",
      "While the Supreme Court has for now given no indication it would seek to overturn Obergefell, it has in other rulings in the last decade strengthened religious rights at the expense of LGBTQ rights, including by expanding the ability of people to seek exemptions from laws they object to because of their faith."

    "story": [
      "It\u2019s not every day a new television series boasts a perfect 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but the new Apple TV sci-fi drama \u201cPluribus\u201d is earning raves from critics and fans alike.",
      "The series, whose first two episodes premiered on Nov. 7, tells the story of Carol Sturka (Rhea Seehorn), a grumpy romance-fantasy author who finds herself among the dozen or so people tasked with saving the world after an alien virus puts everyone else into a happy hive mind.",
      "\u201cPluribus\u201d was created by Vince Gilligan, the mastermind behind \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cBetter Call Saul.\u201d His new series grapples with questions about humanity, technology and contentment: If the creepy hive mind \u2014 like Aldous Huxley\u2019s fictional soma drug in the classic dystopian novel \u201cBrave New World\u201d \u2014 makes everyone happier, maybe it\u2019s OK?",
      "Seehorn, a familiar face to Gilligan fans thanks to her breakout role as Kim Wexler in \u201cBetter Call Saul,\u201d brings her comic sensibilities to Carol, whose misanthropic nature makes her an odd candidate to save humanity.",
      "Gilligan sets the series in and around Albuquerque, New Mexico, the same setting as \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d and \u201cBreaking Bad.\u201d Those fascinated by UFO folklore also know the general area as the home of the 1947 Roswell Incident.",
      "Read on to hear what critics and viewers have said so far about \u201cPluribus.\u201d",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Since it debuted on Nov. 7, critics have raved about \u201cPluribus\u201d with many celebrating the continued collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn.",
      "The show currently has a critic's rating of 100%.",
      "Linda Holmes of NPR called the show a \u201cbrutal watch\u201d at times, noting how \u201cCarol finds herself deep in grief, walking through empty buildings, driving deserted neighborhoods, experiencing the arid desolation of a frictionless life.",
      "\u201cBut the collaboration between Gilligan and Seehorn,\u201d Holmes continues, \u201calso is built on how funny she is, how perfectly suited to both his willingness to plumb deep wells of sadness and the playfulness.\u201d",
      "Joel Keller of Decider agreed the show\u2019s heaviness is offset by its playful tone, writing, \u201c\u2018Pluribus\u2019 is creepy and tension-filled and funny and dramatic and really weird.\u201d",
      "While several critics noted the pacing of \u201cPluribus\u201d can be slow at times, most, like Los Angeles Times critic Robert Lloyd, promised the show ultimately delivers.",
      "\u201cAfter quickly establishing the premise, Gilligan shifts into low gear; this is a slow series, yet never a boring one,\u201d writes Lloyd, adding, \u201cGreat tracts of time pass without dialogue. For most of the way it\u2019s Seehorn\u2019s show, and she\u2019s marvelous \u2014 running through a range of emotions, confused, clever, resigned and determined by turns, as she navigates (as they say in the comics) a world she never made, an angry person beating against a sea of contentment, a complicated person in a one-speed society.\u201d",
      "Nicholas Quah of Vulture also urged viewers to stick with the series, writing, \u201cYou owe it to yourself to give \u2018Pluribus\u2019 a chance. Something glorious is gestating inside this entrancing piece of television, and to experience its full effect, you have to trust the process.\u201d",
      "Chase Hutchinson of the Seattle Times praised the series for asking challenging questions.",
      "\u201cThe more it goes on, the more \u2018Pluribus\u2019 becomes a show of immense, urgent feeling, one that grapples with the terrors of growing numb to loss. It\u2019s about survival versus resistance, compliance versus conflict, fantasy versus reality, and whether a false happiness is worth losing all of who you were for.",
      "\u201cCarol is a bit of a grump,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut she\u2019s our grump, a graceful sliver of humanity\u2019s complexity in a world that\u2019s seeking to flatten it.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018Pluribus\u2019?",
      "Fan reviews on Rotten Tomatoes have also been mostly glowing. The show currently boasts an 84% rating from audiences at home.",
      "\u201cVince Gilligan is the greatest TV writer/show runner of the Gen X cohort. The pilot is original, riveting, mysterious, funny and tragic, all at the same time. I cannot remember being so engaged in a story, at least since his last masterpiece, \u2018Better Call Saul,\u2019\u201d wrote one.",
      "\u201cI was hooked from the beginning. Kept up the pace. Kept up the excitement so far threw (sic) the first 2 episodes ... The acting is superb! Finally something exciting to watch! Thank you,\u201d another agreed.",
      "Not all viewers were happy with \u201cPluribus.\u201d A handful said they were disappointed by the show and confused by all its glowing reviews.",
      "\u201cI went in knowing nothing about this show plus I\u2019m a massive sci-fi fan but I just don\u2019t understand the hype here,\u201d wrote one in part, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s like people\u2019s body were taken over and forced to give 5 stars.\u201d"

      "Now, ahead of its Season 2 premiere, Sylvia tells TODAY.com that for the new episodes, he \u201cwanted to continue to explore the ideas of sisterhood and female friendship and how women bond together in times of adversity to make their way in the world.\u201d",
      "The Season 1 finale of \u201cPalm Royale\u201d was filled with high fashion, an emotional musical performance by Maxine, as well as lies, betrayal, attempted murder and... perhaps an unexpected death?",
      "Throughout the 10 episodes, viewers saw how Chattanooga-native, former beauty pageant contestant Maxine made it her mission to infiltrate the Palm Beach high society and become one of them, despite her humble beginnings. With her husband Douglas (Josh Lucas) by her side \u2014 and his wealthy and incapacitated aunt Norma Dellacorte\u2019s funds and fashion \u2014 she almost got away with it.",
      "It hasn\u2019t been an easy ride if you add Maxine\u2019s love-hate relationship with bartender/pool boy/Norma\u2019s caretaker Robert Diaz (Ricky Martin) and torn-then-repaired friendship with Linda (Laura Dern), who happened to be Douglas\u2019 ex-fianc\u00e9e.",

      "Evelyn discovers that Norma is back in good health and might be up to something, including getting rid of Maxine. Maxine confronts Norma and tells her she is turning her house into a nightclub.",
      "Norma\u2019s life story is recounted at the Beach Ball, but some things don\u2019t add up. Robert asks Axel why things didn\u2019t work out with him and Norma back in the day. Axel shares how after Norma\u2019s dad died she found her boarding school roommate dead at the bottom of the stars. \u201cAgnes was diabetic,\u201d he says. \u201cThey didn\u2019t live long back in those days, at least not without a lot of money.\u201d",

      "\u201cI think like a lot of marriages that go through hard things, where one partner has been basically awful to the other, it\u2019s not so easy to just walk away from a 20-year relationship that is based on love,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope what we\u2019ve built, between Kristen and Josh\u2019s characters, a complicated relationship that people can actually really relate to.\u201d",

A fun challenge for him. But, I think he totally loves her.\u201d",

It really devastated me to have to leave things like that between Maxine and Mitzi,\u201d she says, adding that Mitzi really loved Maxine in her own way.",
      "The actor and model said it \u201cbroke her heart to see these two people who we see really caring about each other and trying to lift each other up ... and you see them hurting each other. I think that was a very painful thing. So I hope that there is an opportunity for (reconciliation).\u201d",
      "Who Is the Real Norma? Who is Agnes?",
      "Sylvia says the big Norma/Agnes reveal has been a long time coming.",
      "He points to the ninth episode where Norma tells Robert she needs \u201chelp with certain tasks, but that she expects discretion, and it\u2019s surrounding the care of her diabetes. She didn\u2019t want anybody to know that she had a weakness.\u201d Her diabetes is brought up later in the episode where Robert tells Linda that Norma is diabetic.",
      "In episode eight, he says, Axel asks Norma why she ghosted him and that she became \u201ca completely different person.\u201d",
      "\u201cEverything really has for the last three episodes been leading up to this revelation that only Robert has put together because of the intimate knowledge he has of Norma and her diabetes,\u201d Sylvia explains.",
      "\u201cSo when Axl says, \u2018Yes, Agnes, she was a diabetic, they didn\u2019t live long back in those days. At least not without a lot of money.\u2019 I think Robert isn\u2019t completely sure of himself until he says \u2018Agnes\u2019 to Norma. She says, \u2018Why did you call me that?\u2019 and then, \u2018Oh my gosh, that secret might die with Robert.\u2019\u201d",
      "Sylvia noted the ironies of Norma\u2019s secret because throughout the entire season, Maxine has been trying to fit in and feels like an imposter.",
      "\u201cBut Norma is the biggest impostor of all,\u201d he says.",
      "Why Didn\u2019t Virginia Get Arrested By the Cops?",
      "Virginia finds Linda locked inside the library in her house after Mary locked her in there. As she opens the door, she gets locked inside as well. Linda asks her why she didn\u2019t get arrested along with the rest of their feminist group.",
      "Robinson tells TODAY.com that Virginia has worked very hard to be where she is.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd those friends in high places come in handy throughout the season. I can\u2019t give away too much about that. But I will say that she has connections,\u201d teased Robinson.",
      "The mystery continued with Sylvia simply adding, \u201cYou have to wait and see.\u201d",
      "However, when pressed, he teased, \u201cVirginia, just like everybody else on this show, has secrets \u2014 and we\u2019re just getting started.\u201d"

      "The Brand's Launch Is Part of a Growing Trend of Young 'Skinfluencers'",
      "In a segment that aired on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk explored the rising trend of Gen Alpha's newfound passion for skin care.",

      "Do Kids Need Skin Care Products? We Asked  Dermatologists",
      "TODAY.com spoke with two dermatologists to get their thoughts on the rising trend of child skin care. Here's what they had to say.",
      "Rini\u2019s website lists out the ingredients featured in the kids\u2019 skin care products. The after-sun face mask includes aloe vera and chamomile; the hydrating mask is made with vitamin B12, glycerin and red algae extract; and the \u201ceveryday\u201d mask features  vitamin E, white tremella mushroom and beta-glucan.",
      "Dermatologist Dr. Fatima Fahs, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of the practice Dermy Doc Institute, tells TODAY.com that kids \u201cdon\u2019t really need to be using any of these ingredients.\u201d",
      "That's because the derm says kids\u2019 skin is typically balanced on its own and \u201cnot problematic.\u201d",
      "Fahs says kids\u2019 skin \u201cneeds very basic things.\u201d Children\u2019s skin barriers are \u201calready very healthy and resilient,\u201d she adds.",
      "Aloe vera is a calming ingredient that can be used after sun exposure, she says. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps support the skin barrier, though she says it\u2019s not needed topically.",
      "Similarly, Fahs says that vitamin B12 is \u201cnot necessarily proven to have any topical benefits on the skin.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt can reduce inflammation overall, but most kids are getting vitamin B12 in their normal diet, so it\u2019s not something that necessarily needs to be applied on the skin,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re already potentially pushing the agenda that kids\u2019 skin needs to be fixed, then we\u2019re potentially highlighting imperfections for kids at a really young age. ... It\u2019s kind of blurring the lines of self-care and promoting this idea that their skin is not already perfect,\u201d Fahs says.",
      "Rini was \u201ccreated for growing faces ... to hydrate, soothe and recover\u201c and is intended for kids ages 3 and up, according to the brand\u2019s product pages.",
      "Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a board-certified dermatologist, says parents don't need to rush their children into a skin care routine.",
      "\"At age 3, the only thing I think we should be considering is getting them into a little habit of being clean and just (hygienic),\" she says, adding that masks and scrubs aren't necessary for young children.",
      "Per Ingleton, children don't need to use preventative skin care products until the onset of puberty.",
      "\"Wait until there is an issue when their skin actually changes.  Then you are targeting their skin with specific products,\" she says.",
      "Fahs seconds that sentiment and advises parents to consider introducing a skin care routine once their kids start to show signs of puberty in their pre-teen years.",
      "At this stage, children might notice an increase in oiliness in their skin, or \u201clittle bumps on the skin toward the end of the day.\u201d Generally, this change can occur between the ages of 8 and 13, with 8 being on the earlier side, Fahs says.",
      "\u201cIntroducing a gentle cleanser, a gentle moisturizer and a broad-spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen is a great routine to encourage,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf I see patients in the office starting to have these changes, the very first thing I\u2019ll try to get them into the habit of doing is just washing their face with a gentle cleanser daily. Sometimes that\u2019s all they need.\u201d",
      "Overall, Fahs says she is seeing more marketing geared toward children, \u201cwhether that\u2019s intentional or not,\u201d and is seeing children come into her clinic \u201cwith more reactive skin barriers now or with problems they didn\u2019t have before starting a routine.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlthough I\u2019m all for healthy routines and habit building, especially in children, this almost takes it to the next level where it becomes harmful,\u201d she says.",
      "Fahs says that children's skin \u201cisn\u2019t just like a smaller version of adult skin.\u201d Rather, it is already \u201cnaturally balanced.\u201d",
      "\u201cChildren don\u2019t need these seven step routines, or these complicated products,\u201d Fahs says. \u201cIf you\u2019re really looking to do some healthy habit building for your kids, the number one thing should just be encouraging them to wear a daily sunscreen before going outside to play.\u201d",
      "She adds, \u201cA lot of this is being disguised in this idea of self-care, but I find that self-care for children is encouraging them to go outside and play or be with their friends, and it\u2019s not standing in front of the mirror or putting on a sheet mask.\u201d",
      "During a live segment on TODAY on Nov. 10, NBC\u2019s Stephanie Gosk said the dermatologists she spoke to suggested avoiding skin care products with harsh ingredients, including retinol, fragrance and artificial dyes. They also suggested steering clear of scrubs, which can irritate skin.",
      "The dermatologists Gosk spoke to recommended seeking out products that say they're dermatologist-tested, hypoallergenic, calming and gentle. Ingredients like oatmeal, aloe vera and chamomile are good.",
      "\"But again, it is a conversation with your kids about what they actually need. And remember that they are going to see this stuff, so you do have to talk about it probably,\" she said."

      "Keep reading to learn more about the true story of John Wayne Gacy, who he was, how he was caught and what happened to him.",
      "Who Was John Wayne Gacy?",
      "Born in 1942 in Chicago, John Wayne Gacy was a building contractor who also dressed as \"Pogo the Clown\" for children's parties.",
      "According to History.com, he had a relatively normal middle-class upbringing, though there were accounts that he had an abusive alcoholic father. He got married in 1964 to Marlynn Myers, whose father owned a couple of Kentucky Fried Chicken franchises in Waterloo, Iowa. As seen in \"Devil in Disguise,\" Gacy managed one of the restaurants. He was later charged and sentenced to 10 years in prison for sexually assaulting one of his male employees in 1968. He was released early due to good behavior.",
      "Gacy and Myers had two children together, Michael and Christine, before they divorced following his charges.",
      "After his release, he moved back to Chicago and remarried Carole Hoff. Once there, he started his construction business and clown work.",
      "What Did John Wayne Gacy Do?",
      "From 1972 to 1978, Gacy lured young men and boys, oftentimes for sex before murdering them and burying them in his home's crawl space.",
      "His murders would go undetected for years until December 1978 when police started investigating the disappearance of 15-year-old teenager named Robert Piest.",
      "How Did John Wayne Gacy Get Caught?",
      "Robert Piest was last seen with Gacy. \u201cDevil in Disguise\u201d shows how he would lure young men with hopes of a construction job, taking him to his home before he killed them.",
      "Piest went missing on his mother Elizabeth Piest's birthday, when he never returned home for dinner.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot out there about Elizabeth, which is good for the Piest family, which I think really valued their privacy,\u201d Ireland tells TODAY.com about portraying the victim\u2019s mother. \u201cFor me, I focused on just telling a story of a woman who was going through this very sudden and intense grief.\u201d",
      "Police began to look into Gacy after learning of his prior conviction. After obtaining a search warrant for his Norwood Park home, they discovered a foul smell and items from other missing men.",
      "According to NBC Chicago, Gacy's then-lawyer Sam Amirante shared in his book \u201cJohn Wayne Gacy: Defending a Monster,\u201d that Gacy confessed to him that Robert Piest was dead and \u201che\u2019s in the Des Plaines River.\u201d",
      "Gacy would go on to detail each of his murders and where he buried or dumped the bodies.",
      "\u201cHe went on, murder by murder, piece by piece, burial by burial,\u201d Amirante wrote. \u201cHe wanted to prove that what he was saying was true. He wanted to take us to his house and show us the burial ground.\u201d",
      "In 1979, Gacy was arrested in Cook County, Illinois. Police continued to find bodies in Gacy's home, as well as the river where he said he disposed of the victims.",
      "What Happened to John Wayne Gacy?",
      "In March of 1980, Gacy was convicted of murdering 33 young men, who ranged from 14 to 21. He was sentenced to death and transferred to death row in the then-new downstate Menard Correctional Center, according to the Chicago Tribune.",
      "More victims continued to be identified as the months and years went by. In 1985, an appeal was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court, upholding Gacy's death sentence.",
      "Gacy was executed by lethal injection at Stateville Correctional Center in 1994.",
      "Five of his victims recovered from his residence remain unidentified. According to the Cooks County Sheriff\u2019s Department, officials tested the remains using the latest technology and DNA profiles suitable for comparison have been obtained.",
      "\u201cI really hope that (with this show) we can start to talk about changing the narrative around dehumanizing people who aren\u2019t like ourselves,\u201d Chernus says. \u201cI really think we are trying to, in a way, address the systemic biases that allowed Gacy to get away with this for so long. And there are still unidentified victims that I hope, in some way, maybe this show allows someone to call in a tip.\u201d",
      "The PD stated that after Gacy\u2019s arrest, they learned that some of his victims were never reported missing by their families. At the time, many were estranged from the victims or were unaware that they were missing.",
      "The department is still accepting information from people who believe their friends or family members might have been one of Gacy\u2019s victims."

      "Season 2 officially dropped on Prime Video Nov. 7 with the first three episodes, each clocking in around one hour. Like Season 1, it will have six episodes, with one new episode dropping each week until Nov. 28.",
      "Season 2 picks up right where last season left off. Ruby Bell (Harriet Herbig-Matten) is confident she and James had reconciled their relationship after he called it off due to a threat from his dad. Meanwhile, James is reeling from the death of his mother, Cordelia.",
      "In the final moments of Season 1, a bereft James stumbled to Ruby\u2019s house. As he peered into her kitchen window, he saw a smiling Ruby surrounded by her parents and sister. But when Ruby looked up, he was gone.",
      "\u201cI love that shot of me looking in and just deciding that I don\u2019t want to destroy her life because I know what my family entails,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "The first episode of Season 2 alone sets the stage for plenty of heartbreak \u2014 so much so that star Herbig-Matten says she had to learn how to separate herself from her character after shooting.",
      "\u201cWhen we shot Season 1, I was 18. ... I think in Season 2 I achieved to separate her emotions from mine, and that was really healthy for me,\u201d Herbig-Matten says. \u201cI know I\u2019m safe, and when we had really intense and emotional scenes, at the end of the day, it\u2019s not my life and it\u2019s not hurting me.\u201d",

      "\u201cEveryone who read the book knows that originally, the kiss with Elaine was at the end of the first book,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "After the death of his mother, and after he decides not to confide in Ruby, James temporarily goes missing. His twin sister, Lydia (Sonja Wei\u00dfer), also starts looking for James. They eventually find him drunk, mid-bender at a raging pool party. Ruby watches his out of control partying in horror. After telling Ruby she doesn\u2019t belong there, he kisses his old flame Elaine in the pool right in front of her.",
      "Ruby walks home alone from the party inconsolable.",
      "The next morning, James wakes up dazed, confused and horrified at what happened.",
      "Hardung describes the kiss as part of a \u201cbrutally honest\u201d depiction of James\u2019 grief. His character tries to push away Ruby because he knows the public spectacle his family brings, especially in the wake of his mother\u2019s death, Hardung says.",
      "In addition to self-isolation and drinking, James also turns to drugs. As his father announces Cordelia\u2019s death at a press conference outside their house, James is inside, using cocaine.",
      "\u201cWe took the time to truly acknowledge his period of grief and to tackle the loss, and I think we were brutally honest about it,\u201d Hardung says.",
      "\u201cI just hope fans are willing to go on that suffering journey with him,\u201d he adds. \u201cI feel like that was my main goal, to make them root for him or feel for him even though he is so inherently flawed and even though he f---- so badly \u2014 to still make people understand that this is the best that he can do at that certain time.\u201d",
      "Why Does Ruby Go Back to James?",
      "So to recap: Less than 15 minutes into Season 2, Ruby and James\u2019 relationship is again on the rocks. But this is \u201cMaxton Hall\u201d after all.",
      "When Ruby witnesses James cheat on her, she doesn\u2019t yet know about his mother\u2019s death. The next morning, still reeling from the kiss and the mounting pressure of a scholarship opportunity, her best friend tells her Cordelia Beaufort had died.",
      "Without hesitating, she goes to the Beaufort mansion to attempt to comfort James.",
      "\u201cI think Ruby has a really good heart, and I think when she loves someone, she loves them deeply, and she gives them everything,\u201d Herbig-Matten says of her character\u2019s decision to go to James\u2019 side. \u201cI think that was no question because she just want to show him that she\u2019s thinking about him and to show her presence, and also to be there for Lydia. I think that was also really important for her.\u201d",
      "Ruby finds James on the bathroom floor. His eyes well as she holds him. Through tears he says he regrets being mean to Cordelia the last time he saw her. He eventually falls asleep in Ruby\u2019s lap.",
      "But after Ruby checks his phone and sees a video message from Elaine from the night before, Ruby starts to withdraw. James tries to apologize and says Elaine means nothing to him. He begs her to stay, but when Ruby tells him he needs help, he shouts for her to leave.",
      "Hardung says he and Herbig-Matten were \u201creally afraid\u201d of this scene specifically.",
      "\u201cWhen we looked at the the shooting schedule, we\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, s--- it\u2019s coming up in two weeks,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "In this scene, Hardung says his character is lying to himself.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a scene objective really clearly \u2014 it\u2019s almost written on my head, \u2018I need you to stay. I need you to love me.\u2019 And then it breaks into, \u2018I need you to leave.\u2019 Out of a fear that I\u2019m not going to achieve my goal, and I can\u2019t stand failing again because I fail so much. So I\u2019d rather change my goal and lie to myself than to fail miserably again,\u201d he says of James.",
      "After James\u2019 mom\u2019s funeral at the end of the first episode, he hijacks a car and goes on a rampage. He tries to call Ruby, and when she doesn\u2019t answer, his driving gets more and more out of control until he spins out and flips the vehicle.",
      "In Episode 2, once he\u2019s released from the hospital, James again apologizes to Ruby and says he wants to fight for her.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t save you, James, only you can,\u201d she finally says, a callback to the name of the second book in the series.",
      "This line sets the stage for Season 2\u2019s overall theme of \u201chealing,\u201d Herbig-Matten says.",
      "\u201cSeason 2 for me is about growth and about healing. And healing means sometimes to fall apart and to get yourself together again and to let people go,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned and what people can learn, and we see that she has to let him go and to heal himself.\u201d"

      "Readers have been upset to learn that the Farmers' Almanac is ceasing publication after more than 200 years in existence.",
      "No, not that one.",
      "The Nov. 6 announcement by the staff at the Maine-based Farmers' Almanac not only caused an outpouring of support for a publication that began in 1818, but also resulted in a competing farmer's almanac putting out a statement that it is still very much in business.",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac, based in New Hampshire, issued a news release on Nov. 7 clearing up any confusion by noting that it is \"still going strong.\"",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Why Is the Farmers' Almanac Shutting Down?",
      "The Farmers' Almanac, based in Lewiston, Me., announced that it is ceasing publication due to the \"growing financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment,\" the company said in a news release.",
      "Access to existing digital content on its website will be discontinued in December.",
      "\"First we want to tell everyone that this decision was very hard to make,\" Farmers' Almanac editor Sandi Duncan told TODAY.com in an email. \"The Almanac has been published each and every year since 1818 \u2014 even when the editor (Ray Geiger) was overseas serving in World War II. And we also recognize that it\u2019s more than just a book \u2014 it\u2019s a way of life \u2014 a tradition \u2014 a resource for so many people for so many years.\"",
      "\"However, readers now access information and answers differently, and the trajectory of newsstand sales made this decision necessary,\" she continued. \"The financial challenges of producing and distributing the Almanac in today\u2019s chaotic media environment, unfortunately lead to this decision.\"",
      "The 2026 Farmers' Almanac will be the final edition of a publication that began in 1818. It features weather forecasts, astronomy tidbits and predictions like the best days to ski, brew beer, plant tomatoes and view meteor showers.",
      "Duncan, who has worked at the publication since 1994, spoke about what she hopes the legacy of the long-running publication will end up being.",
      "\"To remind people to stop and smell the roses,\" she said. \"To appreciate all the wonders of nature, to realize that there is so much we can learn from the natural world even if we live among concrete skyscrapers.\"",
      "The announcement left readers upset at the loss.",
      "\"Sadly another treasured memory will disappear but will never be forgotten,\" one person commented on the Farmers' Almanac website. \"Have read FA since I was a kid, now 70.\"",
      "\"No way! Please tell me it isn\u2019t so,\" another wrote. \"I have had the FA in my home every year since I was 19 years old. I am now in my 70\u2019s. The wit, wisdom, and weather have been like a wonderful old friend to me.\"",
      "\"Please don\u2019t go. I\u2019ve grown up with you and want to keep growing older together,\" another commented. \"Not ready for you to leave. Please reconsider.\"",
      "What Is the Difference Between the Farmer\u2019s Almanac And the Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac?",
      "The Old Farmer's Almanac is based in Dublin, N.H., and has been in existence since 1792.",
      "The Farmer's Almanac is based in Lewiston, Me., and was in existence since 1818.",
      "The editors of the Old Farmer's Almanac released a statement on Nov. 7 in case readers were confused thinking it was going out of business.",
      "\"You may have heard that the Farmers' Almanac, based out of Lewiston, ME, is ceasing publication after an incredible 200+ year run,\" the statement reads. \"Over the years, there has been some confusion between different almanacs, so to be clear: The OLD Farmer\u2019s Almanac isn\u2019t going anywhere. As we have since 1792, during George Washington\u2019s presidency, we will continue to publish our annual edition, while educating and entertaining readers online at Almanac.com.\"",
      "The 2026 Old Farmer's Almanac will feature new gardening books, digital tools, calculators and seasonal weather forecasts. The book also includes gardening knowledge, astronomy and folklore material.",
      "\"Rest assured, as sure as the Sun will rise, The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac \u2014 with our familiar yellow cover and 80% accurate weather forecasts \u2014 will be around for generations to come,\" the statement concluded."

    "story": [
      "Looking for a read to carry you through winter, or at least to Thanksgiving? Author C.J. Farley stopped by the 3rd Hour of TODAY on Nov. 7 to share the books that he's loving lately.",
      "Farley's next novel, \"Who Knows You by Heart,\" out Nov. 11, is a blisteringly relevant dystopia set in the world of Big Tech. Octavia Crenshaw is a coder and one of the few Black employees at the entertainment tech firm she just joined. Then she learns about the secret her company is hiding.",
      "Walter Isaacson, who wrote biographies of Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, said it was \"the first great AI novel of our time, and it is unlikely to be surpassed anytime soon.\u201d",
      "Read on for his book recommendations.",
      "Best thriller",
      "\"All That We See or Seem\" by Ken Liu",
      "Farley calls \"All That We See or Seem\" a \"sci-fi spin on \u201cThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\"",
      "It's about a female hacker-detective searching for a missing performance artist who specializes in creating AI-enhanced dreams.",
      "\"The book is a page-turner, and the main character, Julia Z, has layers that are fascinating to see pulled back. But the ideas at the center of the book are what make it truly special,\" he says.",
      "Best romance",
      "\"An Academic Affair\" by Jodi McAllister",
      "In this romance, two academics fake a marriage so they can accept a joint appointment at a university.",
      "\"My wife Sharon reads one or more romance books a week, and my job as her husband is to keep her supplied with the best ones. Searching out great romance books for her inspired me to make the love scenes in my new novel even better,\" he says.",
      "This one stands out, he says, \u201cbecause it\u2019s about literary academics who are aware of all the tropes in romance stories even as they struggle through them.\"",
      "\"The book also has a great message: nobody should think they are too smart or too busy to fall in love.\"",
      "Best book to screen",
      "\"Hamnet\" by Maggie O'Farrell",
      "With the movie adaptation of \"Hamnet\" out at the end of November, Farley is recommending the novel, which is about William Shakespeare and his wife, Anne Hathaway, grieving the loss of their son Hamnet. It's this grief that scholars believe led to the creation of \"Hamlet.\"",
      "\"It takes a novelist to really fill in the blank spaces in the historical record and tell us how a guy who went through tumultuous times in his early married life channeled all that to create works like 'Hamlet,'\" he says.",
      "Best Thanksgiving read",
      "\"Simply More\" by Cynthia Erivo",
      "\"Wicked\" star Cynthia Erivo tells \"impactful, stripped-down stories about her life and family to inspire readers\" in this book, per Farley.",
      "\"Wicked: For Good\" hits theaters on Nov. 21, so get to know the woman behind the voice.",
      "What CJ's reading",
      "\"I, Medusa\" by Ayana Gray",
      "Medusa is misunderstood in this fantasy novel, which follows how a young woman became a cursed after a dalliance with the gods of Olympics.",
      "\"I love stories that find humanity in monsters and cause us to question our assumptions about who\u2019s good and who\u2019s bad. The Gods in this book, like Poseidon and Athena, are vain and merciless and take advantage of people,\" he says."

      "She decided to turn the idea into a tattoo and specifically chose the typewriter font to match the \u201cdetective vibe\u201d of the show. She isn't the first to do so: Other \u201cLaw and Order\u201d fans have made videos displaying their similar tattoos.",
      "A personal dedication to the series had been brewing in Carroll\u2019s mind years before the bracelet appeared on her feed.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been watching it since '99, literally since it aired, if I\u2019m not mistaken, Sept. 20,\u201d she says. (She\u2019s not wrong.)",
      "She recalls growing up without cable and says one of the few shows she tuned into was \u201cSVU.\u201d She and a childhood friend used to imagine themselves as Mariska Hargitay\u2019s Olivia Benson and Christopher Meloni\u2019s Elliot Stabler.",
      "Carroll connects with Olivia Benson and her commitment to helping victims of sexual assault.",
      "\u201cShe cared for everybody, even the episodes where it\u2019s uncomfortable and she has to work with people that are not aligned with her politically,\u201d she notes. \u201cThe writers did such a great job of including that victims matter. How you feel about a situation doesn\u2019t matter when it comes to helping others and the victims of especially sexual assault.\u201d",
      "Her other favorite character is Fin Tutuola, played by Ice-T. Carroll appreciates how much he supports his son and is an ally of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "On Oct. 13, Carroll sent a tattoo artist the letters and the idea to have them run horizontally down her leg like a sentence. Her tattoo artist was perplexed after receiving the message.",
      "\u201cWhen she asked me what the letters were, I was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to tell you, but I will make a sound.\u2019 And I went, \u2018Dun, dun,\u2019\u201d Carroll says. \u201cShe was like, \u2018Oh, my God, this is \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019! She knew exactly what it was when I said it, which just goes to show how many fans there are out there.\u201d",
      "In just 10 minutes, a tribute to \u201cSVU\u201d was permanently etched into her skin. She later showed the ink to friends and family, who she says were amused. The vice principal at her school playfully rolled her eyes and shook her head when she saw it.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m going to go places with this tattoo.\u2019 And look who I\u2019m talking to!\u201d (Her students were especially excited when the video climbed to 6.7 million views, thanks to the term \u201c67\u201d flooding TikTok.)",
      "Carroll was shocked by the response on social media, with the video reaching 1 million views in just one day. \u201cI was like, I guess I found my people,\u201d she says about the TikTok going viral. \u201cAll the comments were amazing. I was so happy to see that it was mostly positive.\u201d There were some critics, but she adds that many fans were impressed and laughed at the inside joke.",
      "Although the tattoo is a funny way to express her love for \u201cSVU,\u201d Carroll shares that she has a heavier connection to the ink and the series.",
      "\u201cI think another reason that this show really resonates with me is because one in four women has been sexually assaulted,\u201d she says, a statistic confirmed by an article published on the National Library of Medicine\u2019s website. \u201cMyself included.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a weightlifter. I\u2019m not necessarily a small person. I\u2019m 6 foot 1 and I never thought that it would happen to me,\u201d she continues. \u201cI always thought that if I was in that position, I would fight back, or I would put them in their place. And I froze. Olivia\u2019s character tells people that all the time on the show.\u201d",
      "Carroll became emotional while explaining how Olivia\u2019s repeated message that sexual assault victims are not at fault has helped her.",
      "\u201cI have to remember that people are gonna people, and all we can do is survive. Like she tells a lot of the victims on the show, the whole point was that you got out of it. You made it through to the other side. It\u2019s just an unfortunate but good connection to have with that character.\u201d",
      "She also applauds Hargitay for using her platform to speak about sexual assault, particularly the rape kit backlog.",
      "\u201cThis is real life,\u201d Carroll says. \u201cThese are real (stories). Obviously, you know the little disclaimer in the beginning, but it\u2019s still real situations. These are real events that women, especially, have to go through.\u201d"

      "When confronting Peter, Brian discovers (to the whole family\u2019s surprise) that Peter was actually at fault for his life-changing accident. Peter originally made it seem as if Lia was the one that accidentally injured Brian when they were kids.",

It wasn\u2019t his intention to hurt his brother, but he also didn\u2019t clarify that it was his fault and not Lia\u2019s. Since the accident, Lia has blamed herself for her brother\u2019s disability and even struggled with addiction.",
      "Does Peter Get Away With Josie's Death and Secret?",
      "Yes and no. Detectives are still skeptical about how Josie died, but they can't prove that Peter killed her. Days pass and Peter informs Marissa that police have determined that Josie was killed in self defense.",
      "Over the season, Marissa and Jenny get close. In the final episode, Marissa tells Jenny the whole story and that she\u2019s scared to be with Peter.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how I can divorce him, knowing what he can do. I\u2019m stuck, so what\u2019s left?\u201d Marissa says.",
      "At Colin's funeral, Marissa gives Peter something he is allergic to. Pretending like it was an accident, she also gives him an expired EpiPen and removes the emergency ones from their car. The ambulance is too far away and he dies.",
      "Additionally, Detective McConville, who has a neurodivergent son, discovers that Josie and Milo both had synesthesia, a \u201cphenomenon that causes sensory crossovers, such as tasting colors or feeling sounds,\u201d according to Cleveland Clinic.",
      "The first time Josie met Milo, they had bonded over being able to taste colors and see days of the week in color. McConville begins to investigate Josie, Peter and Marissa\u2019s car accident again.",
      "After Peter dies, Lia is questioned by the detectives about Marissa's involvement in his death. Weeks later, McConville visits Marissa and tells her how both Milo and Josie have synesthesia. He also gives her a chance to confess that Peter switched the babies at the accident, killed Rob and put Milo in the trunk.",
      "\u201cAnd I\u2019m guessing you had no idea what was happening until Josephine Murphy showed up to your house with a gun and told you,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I know you were stuck... so you made some choices.\u201d",
      "He tells her the case is now closed, but he feels fine not getting confirmation \u2014 because he too would do anything for his child (including getting rid of criminal records to get his son into a special school)."

      "The new Hulu drama series \u201cAll\u2019s Fair,\u201d which features an all-star cast led by Kim Kardashian, is making headlines for all the wrong reasons as it continues to be panned by critics.",
      "\u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d premiered its first three episodes on the streaming platform Nov. 4, introducing viewers to a group of female divorce attorneys who decide to leave their firm, run by men, and open their own practice.",
      "\u201cFierce, brilliant, and emotionally complicated, they navigate high-stakes breakups, scandalous secrets, and shifting allegiances\u2014 both in the courtroom and within their own ranks. In a world where money talks and love is a battleground, these women don\u2019t just play the game\u2014they change it,\u201d the description reads. The legal drama, co-created by Ryan Murphy and his \u201cGrotesquerie\u201d collaborators Jon Robin Baitz and Joe Baken, also stars Sarah Paulson, Glenn Close, Niecy Nash, Naomi Watts and Teyana Taylor.",
      "But despite all the talented names in front of and behind the camera, the series debuted on Rotten Tomatoes with a 0% score from critics, who wrote mostly scathing reviews about the show\u2019s plot, writing and Kardashian\u2019s performance.",
      "While critics seem aligned on their opinions of \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d so far, the audience score has been somewhat more favorable. Read on to hear what television critics and viewers have been saying about the trending series.",
      "What Have Critics Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "Since it arrived on Hulu, the reviews for \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d  have been overwhelmingly negative. Multiple critics have pointed out the disjointed tone and thin plot.",
      "In her review for Time, Judy Berman wrote, in part, \u201cI can say that, whether it means to be or not, 'All\u2019s Fair' is both reminiscent of some of the small screen\u2019s biggest female-focused hits and unlike anything I\u2019ve seen on TV before.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not a compliment. She later described the series as \u201ca 2010s Shonda Rhimes procedural on steroid shots and Goop supplements, if everyone in the writers\u2019 room had been freshly lobotomized. 'All\u2019s Fair' is 'The First Wives Club' for psychopaths. 'All\u2019s Fair' is a multigenerational, workplace 'Sex and the City,' if the sex were all talk and the city irrelevant and the humor not necessarily intentional.\u201d",
      "New York Magazine\u2019s Vulture critic Roxana Hadadi called out Murphy in her review. \u201cAt his best, Murphy is a connoisseur of low culture, a maestro of story lines that play out at a buzzsaw pace, a sculptor of characters who spit out corrosive one-liners and gnaw through scenery, an architect of goofy sex scenes, and a mastermind at presenting exploitation as empowerment,\u201d she said. \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is cotton-candy TV: sticky, airy, and, once it\u2019s all gone, both satisfying and nausea inducing.\u201d",
      "But there were some positives, as Hadadi wrote that \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d has moments when it is reminiscent of other Murphy series like \u201cNip/Tuck,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cDoctor Odyssey.\u201d",
      "Kaleigh Donaldson of \u201cThe Wrap\u201d was less forgiving, labeling the show \u201cterrible\u201d before pointing out flaws in the script and Kardashian\u2019s acting.",
      "\u201cThere are lines of dialogue here so bad that one wonders if the script ever got past a sketched-out first draft on the back of a napkin. When it\u2019s not lazy exposition, it\u2019s painfully stretched attempts at gif-ready one-liners,\u201d Donaldson said. She also said Kardashian\u2019s inclusion in the series was \u201cstunt casting.\u201d",
      "Kelly Lawler of USA Today flat-out called it \u201cthe worst TV show of the year\u201d in her headline and Variety\u2019s Angie Han said it was \u201cunforgivably dull.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Lucy Mangan gave it zero out of five stars.",
      "The one critic who wrote a complimentary review: Decider\u2019s Joel Keller, who recommended his readers stream the series. His review also bumped the show up to a 6% score on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "\u201cWhen you cram a show like 'All\u2019s Fair' with so many top-notch actors (and, while Kim K. isn\u2019t exactly Watts, Nash or Close-level in the acting department, she holds her own), and then stuff each episode with cases involving huge guest stars, you can\u2019t help but make a show watchable,\u201d he said. Keller also pointed out there were comedic moments in the show that he enjoyed.",
      "He concluded, \u201c'All\u2019s Fair' is over the top and campy as hell, but it also knows it\u2019s both of these things, which is why the show and the cases the firm deals with are going to be fun to watch.\u201d",
      "What Have Fans Said About \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019?",
      "While critics voiced their opinions, hundreds of viewers commented on Rotten Tomatoes to share their thoughts, too. The audience score was mixed, hovering around 61% as of Nov. 5.",
      "One fan left a five-star review and said, \u201cPeople are such haters. Such a fun watch with great talent. Keyboard warriors and trolls seem to basing their ratings based off what they think of the Kardashians and Kim without giving merit to her actual talent, skill and dedication to every craft shes put hands on. If you know you know and if you dont know, take your hate elsewhere.\u201d",
      "Another commented, \u201cI love it, I feel it\u2019s a very clever show. I love the characters in their individuality and how they all bring a different flavor to every episode. I had expectations and I feel glad they didn\u2019t disappoint. Ryan Murphy never disappoints.\u201d",
      "A third agreed about the show\u2019s premise, writing, \u201cPersonally I think it is a powerhouse display of women and law and is very interesting and entertaining.\u201d",
      "Many said they appreciated the campy sense of humor in \u201cAll\u2019s Fair\u201d and were looking forward to the rest of the season.",
      "\u201cAll Fair\u2019s Will Be The People\u2019s Champ! It\u2019s (what we\u2019re) missing on television. It\u2019s funny, fashion forward, campy, glamorous, and filled with shade and reads!! Reviews are being tough but I think the people will enjoy it! It\u2019s something new and original,\u201d one person wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired of the reboot era.\u201d",
      "However, some agreed with the critics.",
      "One one-star review from a viewer read, \u201cAll\u2019s Fair tries to present itself as bold and provocative, but it ends up being tone-deaf and, at times, outright offensive. In the current state of the world, where empathy and awareness should be at the forefront of storytelling, the show\u2019s approach feels careless and disconnected. Instead of challenging viewers to think critically, it relies on exaggerated stereotypes and shallow shock value. What could have been a relevant commentary on justice and social dynamics turns into a spectacle that trivializes serious issues. Art has the power to provoke, but it also carries responsibility. All\u2019s Fair forgets that balance \u2014 and the result is a show that feels out of touch with the moment we\u2019re living in.\u201d",
      "Another said that the promising concept wasn\u2019t executed properly. \u201cWhile this series boasts impeccable styling and a stellar cast, it is completely let down by the awkwardly abrupt writing, delivery, and poor direction. As a result, each scene feels (labored), and the actors showcase their unique skills at a rather jarring, manufactured and superficial level. The concept had great potential \u2014 backed by a solid budget. It is clear something wasn\u2019t working behind the scenes and, in this instance, it may cost Ryan Murphy the attention of his otherwise usually loyal audience.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Canada has lost its measles elimination status, the country\u2019s Public Health Agency announced Monday. It\u2019s the first country in the Americas to do so since the pandemic, and it could serve as a warning sign for others.",
      "There are multiple criteria for losing an official measles elimination status, including declines in vaccination rates. The most significant factor is the ongoing spread of the same strain of the virus for a full year.",
      "Canada\u2019s outbreak started in October 2024 in New Brunswick, a province on the country\u2019s eastern seaboard. As of Monday, Canada\u2019s health officials had tallied 5,138 measles cases since the outbreak began. Two babies, infected in utero, were born pre-term and died.",
      "Despite \u201cgreat efforts\u201d made by Canadian health officials, \u201cthe country has lost its measles elimination status and is now considered endemic for the disease,\u201d Jarbas Barbosa, the head of the Pan American Health Organization, said during a media briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cThis loss represents a setback, of course, but it is also reversible,\u201d Barbosa said.",
      "Canadian health officials will now have to come up with a plan to get back on track, including improving vaccination rates and \u201cenabling better overall surveillance efforts,\u201d the country's public health agency said in a statement.",
      "The country eliminated measles in 1998, two years before the U.S.",
      "The spread of measles in the Americas is not limited to Canada. As of last week, PAHO officials reported that there\u2019ve been 12,593 confirmed measles cases across the entire region, which encompasses North, Central and South America \u2014 30 times the number reported last year.",
      "The vast majority of 2025 cases \u2014 95% \u2014 have been in Canada, Mexico and the U.S., and the latter two countries could soon also lose their measles elimination status.",
      "In Mexico, nearly 4,000 cases have been reported since February. Ongoing spread in the state of Chihuahua, in the northwestern part of the country, accounts for 93% of the country\u2019s outbreak. Twenty-three people have died.",
      "In the U.S., an outbreak that began in January continues to spread across the country.",
      "The outbreak started in West Texas and stretched into New Mexico. At least 862 people \u2014 mostly in Texas \u2014 were infected. Three people died, including two little girls who lived in the epicenter of the outbreak, Gaines County, Texas.",
      "Though cases have subsided in West Texas, the virus has continued to spread. Forty-one states have reported cases. As of last week, 1,681 measles cases had been confirmed in the U.S. in 2025, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the most in more than 30 years.",
      "In Utah and Arizona, an outbreak concentrated in a close-knit community that straddles the border between the states is nearing 200 cases.",
      "In South Carolina, 38 cases have been reported in the northwestern part of the state since July.",
      "The outbreaks have occurred as vaccination rates have declined steadily in the U.S.",
      "A monthslong NBC News investigation revealed that since 2019, 77% of counties and jurisdictions have reported declines in the number of kids getting routine childhood vaccinations like the measles-mumps-rubella shots. Two are recommended.",
      "Vaccination coverage for both MMR doses across countries in the PAHO region averaged 79% last year, according to the group.",
      "Measles is the most contagious virus known on the planet. The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves the room. Anyone in that room who hasn\u2019t been vaccinated against measles will likely get sick.",
      "Who determines a nation\u2019s measles elimination status?",
      "The PAHO, part of the World Health Organization, determines whether a country in North, South or Central America has maintained or lost its elimination status.",
      "Elimination means that a virus has stopped spreading in a specific country or region. Only one virus \u2014 smallpox \u2014 has been eradicated, meaning that it\u2019s been wiped out worldwide.",
      "On a technical level, when one country in the Americas loses its status, the region as a whole is deemed to have lost its elimination status. Canada is the only country in the region, however, that\u2019s been specifically called out for its year-plus measles spread.",
      "Measles is nowhere near being eradicated. Even with Canada losing its measles elimination status, the region of the Americas accounts for just 7.5% of cases globally, Daniel Salas, an immunization expert with PAHO, said during a media briefing Monday. Most are in the Middle East and South Asia.",
      "In 2019, PAHO established a panel of independent experts, called the Regional Verification Commission, to do an annual review of how countries are able to control measles spread.",
      "The panel met last week in Mexico City to analyze the latest measles data submitted from countries with active outbreaks through October.",
      "A PAHO spokesman said the group could not confirm whether its independent committee will meet again in January to discuss measles spread in the U.S."

    "summary": "Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa will meet with President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday.",
    "story": [
      "The Oval Office is a long way from Abu Ghraib.",
      "When he was greeted by President Donald Trump on Monday, Ahmad al-Sharaa completed his journey from jihadist leader to head of state receiving a warm White House welcome.",
      "Since toppling the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, Syria\u2018s interim leader has spent the past year transforming his global image while tackling deep divisions at home.",
      "Now, al-Sharaa, who has thrown off his nom de guerre Abu Mohammad al-Jolani, made history as the first Syrian president to visit the White House.",
      "\"It was an Honor to spend time with Ahmed Hussein al-Sharaa, the new President of Syria, where we discussed all the intricacies of PEACE in the Middle East, of which he is a major advocate. I look forward to meeting and speaking again,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after his meeting with al-Sharaa, who would not have been able to set foot in the U.S. a year ago thanks to the $10 million bounty on his head. \"Having a stable and successful Syria is very important to all countries in the Region,\" Trump added.",
      "During his Washington visit, Al-Sharaa committed to joining the U.S.-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State militant group, a senior administration official told NBC News, a significant step in Syria's engagement with the West. And diplomats will be allowed to return to the Syrian embassy in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe United States will allow Syria to resume operations at its Embassy in Washington to further counterterrorism, security, and economic coordination,\" the senior administration official said.",
      "The State Department removed al-Sharaa and his interior minister from the Specially Designated Global Terrorist list Friday, while the United Kingdom and Europe removed sanctions on al-Sharaa after the United Nations Security Council voted in favor of a U.S.-drafted resolution to do so.",
      "The Washington trip is \u201ca high-level sign of the trust that the American administration has placed in al-Sharaa \u2014 and the hope that he will succeed in holding Syria together during this incredibly complicated transition period,\u201d said Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "A \u2018turning point\u2019",
      "Al-Sharaa rose to power after leading Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, in toppling Assad\u2019s regime last December.",
      "Since then, he has sought to distance himself from his past as a jihadist who had been jailed by U.S. forces in Iraq, trading military fatigues for smart suits and vowing to rebuild Syria and unify its myriad religious and ethnic groups.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach, a dramatic shift for the U.S., has underscored al-Sharaa\u2019s success in breaking the country\u2019s decadeslong global isolation.",
      "The U.S. removed its terrorist designation for HTS, along with the bounty on al-Sharaa himself, before lifting a string of sanctions following a May meeting between the Syrian leader and Trump in Saudi Arabia.",
      "Al-Sharaa was in New York in September to address the United Nations General Assembly, but Syrian Information Ministry said that being welcomed to the White House marked a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d for the country.",
      "At home, however, al-Sharaa has struggled to unify a deeply divided Syria while grappling with broader threats: a resurgent ISIS, fraught relations with increasingly assertive neighbor Israel, and Russia\u2019s determination to maintain its strategic foothold in Syria while giving safe haven to Assad.",
      "Syria has experienced flashes of violence, including deadly attacks against minority groups allegedly carried out in part by government forces. Growing tensions with Kurdish authorities in northeast Syria have also erupted into violent clashes.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s certainly being (very) smart,\u201d John Jenkins, a former British diplomat who has previously served as head of mission in Syria, said of al-Sharaa in emailed comments.",
      "\u201cA trip to D.C. makes him look respectable,\u201d said Jenkins, an associate fellow at Chatham House and a leader at Cambridge University\u2019s Centre for Geopolitics. But, he added, \u201dthe key issues are domestic.\u201d",
      "And within Syria, opinions have been deeply divided.",
      "\u201cHe does not represent the Syrian people,\u201d said Sami Zain Al-Din, a 72-year-old political activist from Sweida, a southern city that was rocked by deadly clashes involving the Druze community, which has close ties to Israel.",
      "For Dr. Jalnar Hamad, doubts over al-Sharaa were balanced against hopes that his meeting with Trump could open a \u201cnew chapter\u201d that could see Sweida \u201cbenefit from development or reconstruction programs,\u201d she said.",
      "Ilham Ahmed, co-chair of the Syrian Democratic Council, the political arm of the Kurdish-led and U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces, said the Trump meeting was \u201can opportunity to redefine the position of the new Syrian state.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s also a chance for Trump to address \u201cthe rights of the Kurdish people and the coalition partners who fought terrorism on behalf of the world,\u201d he said, referring to the SDF\u2019s role against ISIS.",
      "Further sanctions lifted?",
      "Al-Sharaa will be hoping to emerge strengthened domestically, and key to that effort is his bid to remove remaining sanctions imposed on Syria during Assad\u2019s rule.",
      "Already, \u201cthe pace with which sanctions have been eased on Syria since May has been absolutely spectacular,\u201d Karam Shaar, a consultant on Syria and the research director at the Operations and Policy Center think tank in Turkey, said in a voice note.",
      "Shaar said he expected that two \u201cmain pieces of sanctions will have been either lifted or just about to be lifted\u201d by the time al-Sharaa and Trump meet, including the removal of Syria from America\u2019s list of \u201cstate sponsors of terrorism\u201d and the repeal of sanctions under the Caesar Act, a 2019 law targeting the Assad regime.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in a statement on Monday that he had given Syria another waiver on the Caesar Act.",
      "But sanctions will not be the only focus, with the effort to quell ISIS\u2019 resurgence and relations with Israel also expected to play a central role.",
      "The U.S. ally has faced growing isolation on the global stage over its deadly assault in Gaza, but Trump has previously expressed hopes Syria would join other Arab nations in normalizing ties with Israel under the Abraham Accords, which were expanded again last week.",
      "It remains unclear whether Trump will push the matter during talks with al-Sharaa on Monday.",
      "Syria, historically a staunch ally of Iran, has never recognized Israel and has been locked in a state of conflict with the country since its establishment in 1948. Iranian proxy Hezbollah has also long been deeply embedded in Syria after joining the Assad regime\u2019s military efforts.",
      "When Assad was in power, Israel routinely carried out airstrikes against what it said were Iranian-linked targets inside Syria, and since his ouster, it has deployed troops to a United Nations-patrolled buffer zone and has repeatedly launched airstrikes and incursions into Syria.",
      "Damascus has so far refused to retaliate, while both countries have kept the lines of communication open."

    "story": [
      "Fears over dependency on Chinese technology have reached an unlikely corner of the West: the previously serene and efficient world of Scandinavian public transportation.",
      "European nations have become increasingly worried that their vast amounts of Chinese-built infrastructure could be weaponized \u2014 tampered with, immobilized or even commandeered \u2014 if tensions were to rise with Beijing.",
      "Now, bus providers in Denmark and Norway say they are urgently investigating and remedying what they say is a security loophole discovered in their fleets of vehicles made by Yutong, a company based in Zhengzhou, China, that is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of buses by sales volume.",
      "Because these buses can receive updates and diagnostic tests \u201cover the air,\u201d they can be \u201cstopped remotely, either by the manufacturer or by a hacker,\u201d Jeppe Gaard, chief operating officer of the Danish public transport provider Movia, told NBC News in an email Wednesday.",
      "\u201cElectric buses, like electric cars, in principle can be remotely deactivated if their software systems have online access,\u201d he said. This isn\u2019t just a \u201cChinese bus concern; it is a challenge for all types of vehicles and devices with these kinds of electronics built in,\u201d Gaard added.",
      "In Denmark, Movia\u2019s fleet includes 262 Yutong buses, which have been phased in since 2019 across a network that covers the capital, Copenhagen, and the east of the country, Movia said.",
      "The alarm was first raised earlier this month by the Norwegian bus operator Ruter, which runs half of the country\u2019s public transport, including in Oslo, the capital.",
      "Ruter performed underground tests \u201cinside a mountain\u201d on two buses: the Yutong model and one from the Dutch manufacturer VDL.",
      "While the Dutch buses \u201cdo not have the capability for autonomous software updates over the air,\u201d Yutong \u201chas direct digital access to each individual bus for software updates and diagnostics,\u201d it said.",
      "In theory, \u201cthis bus can be stopped or rendered inoperable by the manufacturer,\u201d it said, although Yutong wouldn\u2019t be able to remotely drive these vehicles.",
      "Asked for comment on the Danish and Norwegian moves, Yutong sent an emailed statement saying that it \u201cunderstands and highly values the public\u2019s concerns regarding vehicle safety and data privacy protection,\u201d and \u201cstrictly complies with the applicable laws, regulations, and industry standards.\u201d",
      "It said its vehicle data in the European Union is stored in an Amazon Web Services data center in Frankfurt, Germany, where it is \u201cprotected by storage encryption and access control measures,\u201d and that \u201cwithout customer authorization, no one is allowed to access or operate the system.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s Ministry of Commerce did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "This is just the latest episode in Europe\u2019s complex relationship with China: deeply reliant on Beijing\u2019s trade and increasing know-how, but critical of its alleged cyber-aggression, rampant intellectual property theft and human rights violations.",
      "Even as hope rises for a new trade agreement between China and the E.U., there are grave concerns over plans for a new mega-embassy in London and a lingering scandal over the collapse of an alleged spying case at the heart of Westminster.",
      "Meanwhile, the Dutch government has seized control of the Chinese chipmaker Nexperia, in a saga that has raised fears that car production could come to a halt on the Continent.",
      "Even more so than the United States, European nations have relied on China for critical infrastructure \u2014 only to conclude that it poses a problem if and when relations go south.",
      "A number of European governments have torn out 5G networks made by the Chinese giants Huawei and ZTE \u2014 under pressure from Washington \u2014 because of fears they could be used by Beijing to compromise Western national security.",
      "Today\u2019s hot-button issue is Chinese electric vehicles, which are effectively blocked from sale in the U.S. but whose market share is ballooning in Europe, doubling to 5.1% in the first half of 2025 from last year, according to the auto consultancy JATO Dynamics.",
      "As with other Western concerns, China has roundly rejected that its EVs and other technologies present a security risk.",
      "In January, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry condemned American moves to block Chinese tech from the U.S. auto market, accusing it of \u201coverstretching the concept of national security\u201d and calling for Washington to \u201cstop going after Chinese companies,\u201d spokesman Guo Jiakun said at a daily news briefing.",
      "But plenty of security and intelligence officials are concerned.",
      "Western nations had \u201cthe whole problem with Huawei and 5G, and you\u2019ve now got a similar problem in Chinese electric cars: that they can all be immobilized at a switch from the manufacturer,\u201d the former head of Britain\u2019s MI6 intelligence agency, Richard Dearlove, told NBC News in an interview earlier this year.",
      "\u201cSo if we have a crisis with China, they can bring London to a complete halt by reprogramming\u201d these vehicles.",
      "In reality, this is also true of any electric vehicle \u2014 including those made by Tesla, for example \u2014 and many other items reliant on internet connectivity, said Ken Munro, founder of the British American cybersecurity consultancy Pen Test Partners.",
      "In Norway, Ruter, the electric bus operator, said it had carried out several fixes, including stricter controls on future bus purchases, \u201cfirewalls\u201d to protect against hackers, and \u201ccollaborating with national and local authorities on clear cybersecurity requirements.\u201d",
      "Are experts convinced this will work?",
      "\u201cNot really,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cAny degree of connectivity and the ability to update software, which we all want as consumers,\u201d he said, \u201chas to be enabled.\u201d Munro added: \u201cThe only way to do this, to my mind, would be for the operator to remove all connectivity from that vehicle.\u201d",
      "Munro questioned whether China would actually want to exploit a potential vulnerability like the one identified in the Scandinavian buses.",
      "\u201cDo we believe that China would destroy its entire export industry for vehicles, EVs or not, in order to prove a political and military point? It is within the bounds of plausibility,\u201d but the chances are \u201cincredibly small,\u201d Munro said.",
      "\u201cIt just comes down to trust,\u201d he added."

      "What once might have been an isolated blunder comes at an unwelcome time in a country strained by rising prices, stagnant wages and crumbling public services.",
      "One man, an Algerian sex offender, was arrested in London on Friday after being freed in error nine days earlier; another, a British national and convicted fraudster, accidentally released from the same prison shortly afterward and turned himself in on Thursday.",
      "Their cases followed the mistaken release of a convicted sex offender from a separate prison in October, which sparked a three-day manhunt before he was rearrested.",
      "At least four prisoners released in error over the past year remain at large, the BBC reports. More than 260 were wrongly released in England and Wales in the year to March, official data shows \u2014 more than double the figure the year before.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister and Justice Secretary David Lammy said on X Friday that he was \u201cappalled at the rate of releases in error,\u201d and had ordered \u201ctough new release checks, launched an investigation, and started overhauling archaic prison systems.\u201d",
      "He told Parliament on Wednesday that the opposition Conservative Party, whose 14-year spell in government was ended by Prime Minister Keir Starmer last year, had \u201cleft our prisons on the brink of collapse entirely.\u201d",
      "But the recent litany of errors coincides with the ruling Labour Party battling its own economic constraints and record-setting unpopularity.",
      "British prisons have been in a state of crisis for several years, with the prison population more than doubling in size since 1990, while staffing and infrastructure struggle to keep pace.",
      "The Algerian offender, Brahim Kaddour-Cherif, 24, was mistakenly let out on Oct. 29, though police say they weren\u2019t informed until nearly a week later. He was rearrested for being unlawfully at large and on suspicion of assaulting an emergency worker in connection with an earlier incident.",
      "As officers bundled him into a van, he offered his own verdict on the system that lost track of him: \u201cLook at the justice of the U.K., they release people by mistake,\u201d he said in a video aired by NBC News\u2019 British partner Sky News.",
      "It\u2019s a throwaway line, but it lands with an uncomfortable truth. In a country where little seems to function as it should \u2014 from the courts to the National Health Service to the trains \u2014 even the prisons can\u2019t quite manage to keep the doors locked.",
      "Years of budget cuts are \u201ccatching up\u201d with Britain\u2019s public services, according to Glen O\u2019Hara, a professor of modern and contemporary history at Oxford Brookes University.",
      "\u201cThe whole system of social care, for instance, is completely overwhelmed,\u201d he told NBC News on Saturday, adding that Britain\u2019s prisons had been swamped by a large number of short prison sentences.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just overwhelming the system that can\u2019t cope economically with all these numbers,\u201d he said.",
      "Last summer, the men\u2019s prison system was nearly filled to capacity with only a hundred or so empty places, a crisis that triggered the government\u2019s emergency release scheme, allowing some inmates to leave after serving 40% of their sentence instead of the usual 50%. Introduced to ease overcrowding, the policy has since seen nearly 40,000 prisoners released early, Ministry of Justice figures show.",
      "Staffing issues have also plagued the services. In the year to June, nearly 13% of staff left British prisons, according to data from the Prison and Probation Service.",
      "Prison officers said a clerical error meant there was no warrant from the court to hold Kaddour-Cherif, and he was let go. William Smith, the convicted fraudster, was released as a result of a clerical error at the court level, the BBC reports.",
      "Wandsworth prison, where Smith and Kaddour-Cherif were released, was built in 1851 to house fewer than 1,000 prisoners. An August 2024 report by the prison\u2019s independent monitoring board found inmate numbers had grown to 1,513.",
      "\u201cWings were chaotic and staff across most units were unable to confirm where all prisoners were during the working day,\u201d the report said.",
      "The Victorian-era prison, one of many still in use dating back to the 1800s, has previously been the scene of high-profile escapes. Wandsworth made headlines in 2023 when former British soldier Daniel Khalife escaped by clinging to the underside of a lorry while awaiting trial for espionage and terrorism offenses.",
      "A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said that the recent cases \"further expose the scale of the crisis in our prisons we inherited,\" adding: \"This will not be fixed overnight, but we are using every possible lever to bear down on these errors.\"",
      "For all the headlines and investigations, the mistakes continue to pile up in a country struggling to hold itself together, one unlocked gate at a time."

But the Sudanese military, which it has been fighting since April 2023, has yet to agree to a truce, and the State Department has said it is still working to get both parties to agree to a pause in the fighting amid warnings from the humanitarian organizations that the northeast African nation is returning to its genocidal past.",

      "\u201cThey drove him to some place,\u201d she told NBC News in a voice note on Thursday. \u201cLater in the evening, they told us they would bring him back, but they never did.\u201d",
      "NBC News has asked the RSF for comment on Musa\u2019s testimony.",
      "Musa, 20, said she had no choice but to keep moving toward Tawila after fighters took her phone and money at a previous checkpoint.",
      "She was one of only about 6,000 people to make it to the town from el-Fasher since the RSF takeover, according to humanitarian organizations working there, all of whom have expressed growing alarm about the paramilitary group\u2019s activity in Sudan\u2019s North Darfur.",
      "\u201cEvery single person who has arrived in Tawila has one or multiple members of their family that they cannot account for,\u201d according to Shashwat Saraf, the country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian organization that provides aid to displaced people."

    "story": [
      "A cyberattack against British car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover, the country\u2019s largest automaker, has been so catastrophic that it put a dent in the U.K.\u2019s gross domestic product, the Bank of England said.",
      "In its quarterly monetary policy report, released Thursday, the Bank of England said headline GDP had grown by 0.2%, less than it had projected. That slowdown was due to reduced exports to the U.S. and \u201cdisruption linked to the Jaguar Land Rover cyberattack,\u201d it said.",
      "The hack against Jaguar Land Rover, which began in August, has proven to be the most economically devastating in British history, said Ciaran Martin, the chair of the technical committee at Cyber Monitoring Centre, a nonprofit that tracks the impacts of cyberattacks on the country.",
      "\u201cWhat makes this incident so bad is the total shutdown of industrial production. That\u2019s much rarer in cyberattacks than is commonly understood,\u201d Martin told NBC News.",
      "Jaguar Land Rover didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment. The company first publicly acknowledged the attack on Sept. 2, saying that while the hackers didn\u2019t appear to steal customer data, \u201cour retail and production activities have been severely disrupted.\u201d It then took almost four weeks before the company announced it was even close to resuming manufacturing.",
      "In a report on the hack published last month, the Cyber Monitoring Centre found the attack had cost an estimated 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion), surpassing the WannaCry attack of 2017. WannaCry, which the U.S. and U.K. accused North Korea of creating, spread across computers around the world, with the British National Health Service among the biggest victims. Roughly 1 in 5 of the trusts that administer NHS hospitals were locked down through that attack.",
      "Though the Cyber Monitoring Centre said that the specifics of what happened at Jaguar Land Rover are still unclear, the attack\u2019s fallout has been extremely far-reaching, affecting the company\u2019s global manufacturing operations at at least three U.K. plants, as well as car dealerships and a host of smaller companies that supply automotive parts.",
      "\u201cProduction lines were halted for several weeks, dealer systems were intermittently unavailable, and suppliers faced cancelled or delayed orders, with uncertainty about future order volumes,\u201d the report found.",
      "The known details of the event are consistent with ransomware, where cybercriminals gain access to a company\u2019s or government\u2019s computer systems and encrypt or threaten to delete them, demanding an extortion payment to make them usable again. Even when victims choose to pay their attackers, it can take weeks or months to restore operations.",
      "Ransomware is one of the most destructive and profitable forms of cybercrime. An analysis published in February by the U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence found there had been at least 5,289 attacks in 2024, with some netting tens of millions of dollars in ransom payments.",
      "The British government has not publicly accused anyone of masterminding the hack. A group of hackers who had claimed to be behind a string of other hacks against large British and American companies earlier this year told the BBC in September that they were responsible for hacking Jaguar Land Rover. NBC News was unable to confirm with the group, as their channel on Telegram, the app where they had previously made such claims, has been deleted."

      "Suharto, a staunch anti-communist who was a close U.S. ally during the Cold War, ruled for 32 years before he was ousted by deadly mass protests in 1998 amid the Asian financial crisis. His rule was marked by rapid economic growth and political stability as well as accusations of human rights violations, corruption and nepotism.",
      "Suharto was among 10 people who received the national hero title at the presidential palace in Jakarta. The annual award is given to those who have contributed significantly to the development of Indonesia, a Southeast Asian archipelago and former Dutch colony that declared independence in 1945.",
      "\u201cA prominent figure from Central Java province, a hero of the struggle for independence, General Suharto stood out since the independence era,\u201d an announcer said as Prabowo gave the award to Suharto\u2019s daughter and son.",

      "Minister of Culture Fadli Zon said Suharto had played a key role in Indonesian independence and also led the military operation that helped regain what is now West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s.",
      "Suharto was a key military officer during a 1965 military-led purge of communists said to be planning a coup. Indonesia has never investigated the purge, during which historians say about 500,000 people were killed in one of the 20th century\u2019s worst massacres, and Suharto was never proved to be involved.",
      "He also oversaw Indonesia\u2019s 1975 invasion of East Timor and the 24-year occupation that followed, which is estimated to have killed 100,000 people or more. East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, gained independence from Indonesia in 2002.",
      "Suharto and his family were also accused of stealing as much as $45 billion in state funds, though it was never proven. Though authorities tried to bring corruption charges starting in 2000, Suharto did not appear in court and the charges were later dropped because of his poor health. He died in 2008 in his late 80s.",
      "He is also credited with driving the rapid economic development of Indonesia, a country of 280 million people that is the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "\u201cIn the \u201970s and \u201980s, 50 million people were lifted out of the most severe poverty,\u201d David Henley, a professor of contemporary Indonesian studies at Leiden University in the Netherlands, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThat is Suharto\u2019s greatest claim to hero status.\u201d",
      "Despite the atrocities that marked Suharto\u2019s regime, he was \u201cnever completely disgraced,\u201d Henley said.",
      "\u201cThere has for some time been a tendency in official circles to rehabilitate Suharto\u201d and to see his regime \u201cin a progressively more positive light,\u201d he said.",
      "Others have resisted that trend.",
      "Every Thursday there is a silent protest outside the presidential palace in Jakarta over Suharto's alleged abuses, including by people still searching for loved ones.",
      "Protesters also gathered in Jakarta last week to oppose giving Suharto the national hero title.",
      "Prabowo, who was formerly married to Suharto\u2019s daughter Siti Hediati Hariyadi, also has a military background. He has denied accusations of human rights violations in East Timor, where he led a special forces unit in the 1980s, and in Papua.",
      "He was also commander of a special forces unit that was accused of abducting and torturing democracy activists in the 1990s, though Prabowo was never charged.",
      "He was later banned from traveling to the U.S. until 2020, when he became defense minister. He became president last year.",
      "Even after Suharto\u2019s death, his family\u2019s legacy remains deeply entrenched in Indonesian politics. His political party, Golkar, is still a formidable force and backed Prabowo\u2019s presidential bid last year."

      "Hungary is a major importer of Russian energy, and the sanctions were set to squeeze its already ailing economy ahead of elections next year that present the biggest challenge to what the European Union calls Orb\u00e1n\u2019s \u201chybrid regime of electoral autocracy.\u201d",
      "In a post on X, Orb\u00e1n said he had received a guarantee of \u201cfull sanction exemptions\u201d for key pipelines, allowing Hungary to continue providing \u201cthe lowest energy prices in Europe.\u201d",
      "He said Hungary was in a \u201csignificantly different situation\u201d from other European countries, suggesting it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to secure affordable energy if sanctions remained in place.",
      "A White House official told Reuters that Hungary has received a one-year exemption from U.S. sanctions for using Russian oil and gas.",
      "Hungary has meanwhile agreed to buy U.S. liquefied natural gas, the State Department said, noting contracts were expected to be worth about $600 million.",
      "The two nations also agreed to work together on nuclear energy, with Hungary agreeing to purchase American nuclear fuel, which it currently buys from Russia.",
      "Under Orb\u00e1n\u2019s premiership, Hungary is one of the only E.U. member states to maintain warm relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Orb\u00e1n has also cultivated close ties with Trump\u2019s allies in Washington, sharing CPAC stages, coordinating through think tanks and syncing anti-immigrant and anti-woke messaging across the Atlantic.",
      "In comments to state radio last week, Orb\u00e1n made clear he would try to \u201cmake the Americans understand\u201d that Hungary needs a carveout for its continued purchases of Russian energy.",
      "And Hungarian officials said in the run-up to the meeting that the prime minister aimed to discuss a path to a U.S.-Russia meeting and seek exemptions from U.S. energy sanctions. International Monetary Fund figures show Hungary relied on Russia for 74% of its gas and 86% of its oil in 2024.",
      "Trump canceled his planned summit with Putin, which was slated to take place in Hungary\u2019s capital, Budapest, after the Russian leader stuck to his hard-line demands on ending his war in Ukraine."

    "summary": "Middle-class Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
    "story": [
      "NEW DELHI \u2014 When the weight loss drug Mounjaro came on the market in India earlier this year, Shyamanthak Kiran was one of the first patients to try it.",
      "Kiran, a 27-year-old financial trader who has struggled with hypothyroidism, said he \u201cdid not have a lot of expectations\u201d when it came to losing weight. But \u201cluck turned out in my favor,\u201d he said, and in six months he lost all of the 60-plus pounds he had gained a few years earlier.",
      "\u201cIt was a two-year struggle that came to an end, and I couldn\u2019t be happier,\u201d he told NBC News.",
      "Indians trying to lose weight are embracing drugs such as Mounjaro, which is also used to treat diabetes in a country that has been called the world\u2019s diabetes capital.",
      "The injectable medication from American pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has become India\u2019s most popular drug by value since being approved in March, with over $11 million in sales in October, pharmaceutical market research firm Pharmarack said Friday.",
      "Even before India\u2019s more recent approval of Ozempic, another drug that is widely used for weight loss in the United States and other countries, there was already surging demand in the country for semaglutide, its active ingredient.",
      "Ozempic\u2019s Danish drugmaker, Novo Nordisk, says it is \u201cactively working\u201d to widen the availability of the drug, which Indian regulators have approved for diabetes but not obesity. The company also makes other semaglutide drugs that are already used for weight loss in India, including Wegovy, an injectable, and Rybelsus, which is taken orally.",
      "Demand could grow even further when the patent for Ozempic\u2019s active ingredient, semaglutide, expires next March in India, a pharmaceutical manufacturing giant where companies are eager to produce cheaper generic versions of the lucrative weight-loss drugs.",
      "The exploding popularity of the drugs has taken aback some doctors and officials, with Jitendra Singh, a government minister and physician, warning in August against the \u201cunchecked spread of disinformation\u201d through \u201cfad regimens\u201d and emphasizing the importance of lifestyle interventions such as regular yoga practice.",
      "Semaglutide and tirzepatide, the active ingredient in Mounjaro, are GLP-1 agonists that were first developed to treat diabetes and have also been approved in many countries for the treatment of obesity. They regulate blood sugar and help slow how quickly food passes through the stomach, curbing hunger as a result.",
      "India, the world\u2019s most populous country, has over 100 million people with diabetes, or nearly 10% of its adult population, according to a 2023 study by the Indian Council of Medical Research. An additional 135 million people are prediabetic, the study found.",
      "Doctors say the situation is worsening as India\u2019s burgeoning middle class adopts a more Western lifestyle, eating more high-fat, high-sugar foods and exercising less.",
      "\u201cCompared to, say, a decade ago, there are more people now in their late 20s and early 30s who are being diagnosed with diabetes, as compared to the elderly population,\u201d said Dr. Saurav Shishir Agrawal, an endocrinologist in Noida, which is part of Delhi\u2019s capital region.",
      "\u201cThey ask us to just give them pills,\u201d Agrawal said, \u201cbut these medicines work better only when you are clubbing them with lifestyle changes.\u201d",
      "Agrawal practices at the newly built Medanta Hospital, where staff greet patients with a gentle \u201cNamaste.\u201d It is an example of the growing number of modern and high-end hospitals popping up around increasingly dense megacities such as Delhi, home to 33 million people, where diabetes has a greater hold.",
      "A monthly course of Mounjaro can cost as much as $250, the average monthly salary in many parts of India. But for more affluent Indians, a bigger deterrent is the idea of injecting themselves, said Dr. Tribhuvan Gulati, an endocrinologist.",
      "\u201cPeople get scared whenever you tell them that they\u2019re going to be on an injectable,\u201d said Gulati, who has a clinic in central Delhi.",
      "Gulati keeps a demo pen of Mounjaro in a drawer to show how easy it is to use the medicine, which just needs to be refrigerated before use.",
      "But the ease of use is also what worries Gulati and other doctors, who say many patients fail to overhaul the lifestyle and dietary habits causing or contributing to their health issues in the first place.",
      "\u201cIf you look at the causes of obesity in India, it is 90% lifestyle and 10% anything else,\u201d said Dr. Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis Centre for Diabetes, Obesity and Cholesterol and head of India\u2019s National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe diet now is totally imbalanced because of free availability of food everywhere,\u201d he said.",
      "The potential gastrointestinal and other side effects from the weight-loss drugs, which in the U.S. have prompted multiple lawsuits against GLP-1 makers, give some patients pause, Gulati said. But others \u201care OK with continuing it throughout their life because they know that they won\u2019t be able to control themselves.\u201d",
      "Diabetic patients such as Moinak Pal, who has high insulin resistance, say that GLP-1 drugs have been the easiest way to lose weight.",
      "\u201cI have been fat-shamed since I was a child,\u201d said Pal, 34, a Noida-based journalist. He said he has been losing about 3 pounds a week since he started taking Mounjaro.",
      "It was \u201cextremely difficult for me to lose weight by conventional means,\u201d he said.",
      "Part of the problem, Misra said, is the lifestyle in India\u2019s sprawling and congested urban areas, where commutes can last as long as four hours round-trip. When workers get home, apps can deliver everything from food to clothes to their doorsteps in minutes.",
      "\u201cThey want quick fixes that don\u2019t involve going on a restrictive diet or daily exercise of an hour and so on,\u201d he said of some of his patients. \u201cAs a result, diabetes is everywhere. Every day I see patients who are young, who have uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes.\u201d",
      "Rajendra Nath Dixit blames nobody but himself for his health problems. The retired banker had heart bypass surgery earlier this year, and before that had been spending almost 8,000 rupees ($90) a month just on his insulin.",
      "\u201cI was fond of taking the typical Indian oily foods, samosas, chole bhature, and in the evening I would take five or six rotis,\u201d said Dixit, 66. \u201cEvery bad habit was there.\u201d",
      "In the five months since his surgery, Dixit has switched over completely to the oral semaglutide Rybelsus, is exercising more and is consuming less fat and sugar. He is spending 11,000 rupees ($125) a month on Rybelsus, but has been able to stop using insulin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m feeling very good, very light,\u201d he said. \u201cMy confidence has gone up, and my life has totally changed.\u201d"
