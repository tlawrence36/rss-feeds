      "Refugee children in Kenya's Kakuma camp are turning to dance to cope with harsh conditions",
      "KALOBEYEI, Kenya -- Beads of sweat drip from the faces of young girls and boys as they dance to the rhythm of traditional drums and open calabashes, while their peers watch them in awe.",
      "These are refugee children, some who were born in one of Africa\u2019s largest camps \u2014 Kakuma, located in northern Kenya, where more than 300,000 refugees\u2019 livelihoods have been affected by funding cuts that have halved monthly food rations.",
      "The children use the Acholi traditional dance as a distraction from hunger and have perfected a survival skill to skip lunches as they stretch their monthly food rations that are currently at 30% of the U.N nutritional recommendation per person.",
      "The Acholi people, mostly from Uganda and South Sudan, are among refugees who live in Kakuma camp, which was established in 1992 as a safe haven for people fleeing conflict from dozens of east African countries.",
      "For a moment, the melodious sound of one of the refugee mothers stops the playground buzz of activity as dozens of children sit down to enjoy the traditional dance performance.",
      "The colorful swings doting the community center at Kakuma\u2019s Kalobeyei Refugee Settlement were donated by a Swiss organization, Terre des hommes, which still manages the playground aptly named \u201cFuraha\u201d \u2014 Swahili for Happiness.",
      "But the happiness of these children isn't guaranteed now as funding cuts have affected operations here. Fewer resources and staff are available to engage the children and ensure their safety.",
      "One of the dancers, Gladis Amwony, has lived in Kakuma for 8 years now. In recent years, she has started taking part in the Acholi traditional dances to keep her Ugandan roots alive.",
      "The now 20-year-old doesn't imagine ever going back to Uganda and has no recollection of life in her home village.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happiest when I dance, I feel connected to my ancestors,\u201d the soft-spoken Amwony says after her dance session.",
      "While Amwony and her friends are looking for a cultural connection, just about 5 kilometers (3 miles) from their village in neighboring Kalobeyei Village 3, some boys are in touch with modernity.",
      "The five boys have been practicing a one-of-a-kind dance where they mimic robots, complete with face masks that hide their human faces.",
      "They make their sharp synchronized moves that they have been perfecting for months.",
      "The boys will be part of performances that will be showcased during this year\u2019s World Refugee Day, as an example of the talent and resilience that exists among the refugee community.",
      "This younger generation of dancers make precision moves in a small hall with play and learning items stored in a cabinet that is branded with an American flag, an indication that it was donated by the U.S government.",
      "Such donations are now scarce, with the United States having cut down on funding in March.",
      "These cuts have affected operations here, with the future stardom hopes for these children dimming by the day.",
      "The center, which previously featured daily programs such as taekwondo and ballet, may not be operational in a few months if the funding landscape remains as is.",
      "\u201cWe are now reducing some of the activities because we are few. The staff are few and even per day we only have one staff remaining in the center and it is really hard for him/her to conduct 500 children,\u201d said John Papa, a community officer for Terre des hommes in Kalobeyei Village 3.",
      "These programs do more than entertain the children \u2014 they keep them away from issues such as child labor, abuse and crime which as a major concern for humanitarian organizations in Kakuma.",
      "And as the children dance and play beneath the sweltering sun, the only hope is that these child friendly spaces remain operational for years.",

      "The sky itself is no limit for billionaire Jeff Bezos and fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez",
      "VENICE, Italy -- The Italian city of Venice was making waves Friday with the most anticipated wedding of 2025 \u2014 that of billionaire Jeff Bezos and his fianc\u00e9e Lauren S\u00e1nchez. The sky itself is no limit for this couple who have traveled into space, and expectations are about as high.",
      "One of the world\u2019s most enchanting cities as backdrop? Check.",
      "Star-studded guestlist and tabloid buzz? Of course.",
      "Local flavor? You bet.",
      "Beyond that, the team of the world\u2019s fourth-richest man has kept details under wraps. Still, whispers point to events spread across the lagoon city, adding complexity to what would have been a massive logistical undertaking even on dry land.",
      "On Thursday, dozens of private jets touched down at Venice\u2019s airport as yachts pulled into the city\u2019s famed waterways. Aboard were athletes, celebrities, influencers and business leaders, converging to revel in extravagance that is as much a testament to the couple\u2019s love as to their extraordinary wealth.",
      "The heady hoopla recalled the 2014 wedding in Venice of actor George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, when adoring crowds lined the canals and hundreds of well-wishers gathered outside City Hall.",
      "Not so for these nuptials, which have become a lightning rod for protests.",
      "Still, any desire to dampen the prevailing fever pitch has yet to materialize. Instead, the glitterati were set to party, and the paparazzi jostling for glimpses of the gilded gala.",
      "Whatever happens, it will be a wedding for the ages.",
      "Venice is famed for its network of canals, where gondoliers croon for lovestruck couples and even ambulances are aquatic. But water transport of everything from bouquets to guests makes Venice among the world's most challenging cities for a party, according to Jack Ezon, CEO of luxury travel advisory and event planner Embark Beyond.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very tight-knit community; everyone there knows everyone, and you need to work with the right people,\u201d said Ezon, whose company has put on a dozen high-end events in Venice. \"There\u2019s very tight control, especially on movement there with boats.\u201d",
      "It at least triples the cost versus staging the same soiree in Rome or Florence, he said.",
      "Veneto Gov. Luca Zaia was first to give an estimated tally for the Bezos/S\u00e1nchez bash: He told reporters this week the most recent total he saw was between 40 million and 48 million euros (up to $56 million).",
      "It\u2019s an eye-popping, jaw-dropping figure that's over 1,000 times the $36,000 average cost of American couples' weddings in 2025, according to wedding planning website Zola\u2019s annual report.",
      "Bezos\u2019 team has been tight-lipped about where these millions are going. When the youngest son of Asia\u2019s richest man married last July, performances by pop stars Rihanna and Justin Bieber pushed up the price tag.",
      "\u201cHow do you spend $40 million on a three- or four-day event?\u201d Ezon said. \u201dYou could bring headliners, A-list performers, great DJs from anywhere in the world. You could spend $2 million on an incredible glass tent that\u2019s only there for 10 hours, but it takes a month to build,\" or expand the celebration to local landmarks.",
      "There's no sign S\u00e1nchez and Bezos, the former CEO of Amazon, intend to take over any of Venice\u2019s tourist-thronged hotspots. Still, intense hand-wringing about the prospect prompted their wedding coordinator, Lanza & Baucina, to issue a rare statement calling those rumors false.",
      "On Thursday, a string of water taxis cut through the lagoon to bring Bezos, S\u00e1nchez and guests to the Madonna dell\u2019Orto cloister as some onlookers cheered. Paparazzi followed in their own boats, trying to capture guests on camera \u2014 Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom \u2014 as police on jet skis patrolled.",
      "Local media have reported the couple will hold a ceremony Friday on San Giorgio island, across the lagoon basin from St. Mark\u2019s Square. Associated Press journalists circling the island Thursday saw workers assembling tents and private security personnel stationed at every pier, including a newly built one.",
      "Media have also reported a reception Saturday in the Arsenale, a former navy base best known as a primary venue for the Venice Biennale.",
      "There are some who say these two should not be wed in this city.",
      "They characterize the wedding as a decadent display of wealth in a world with growing inequality, and argue it's a shining example of tourism taking precedence over residents\u2019 needs, particularly affordable housing and essential services. Venice is also one of the cities most vulnerable to rising sea levels from climate change.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 are protesting under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words referring to his space exploration company Blue Origin and the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "Greenpeace unfurled a banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square denouncing Bezos for paying insufficient taxes. Activists floated a bald-headed Bezos-inspired mannequin down a Venice canal atop an Amazon delivery box, its hands clenching fake cash.",
      "Authorities \u2014 from Venice's mayor to the nation\u2019s tourism minister \u2014 have dismissed the outcry, saying it ignores the visibility and economic boost the wedding brings.",
      "\u201cThere will be photos everywhere, social media will go wild over the bride\u2019s dress, over the ceremony,\u201d Italy\u2019s tourism minister, Daniela Santanch\u00e8, told the AP.",
      "\u201cAll of this translates into a massive free publicity campaign. In fact, because they will spend a lot of money, they will enrich Venice \u2014 our shopkeepers, artisans, restauranteurs, hotels. So it\u2019s a great opportunity both for spending and for promoting Italy in the world.\u201d",
      "As Amazon\u2019s CEO, Bezos usually avoided the limelight, frequently delegating announcements and business updates to his executives. Today he has a net worth of $231 billion, according to Forbes.",
      "In 2019, he announced he was divorcing his first wife, MacKenzie Scott, just before the National Enquirer published a story about an affair with S\u00e1nchez, a former TV news anchor. S\u00e1nchez filed for divorce the day after Bezos\u2019 divorce was finalized.",
      "He stepped down as CEO in 2021, saying he wished to spend more time on side projects, including Blue Origin, The Washington Post, which he owns, and his philanthropic initiatives.",
      "Sitting beside S\u00e1nchez during an interview with CNN in 2022, he announced plans to give away the majority of his wealth during his lifetime.",
      "Last week, a Venetian environmental research association issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d CORILA, which seeks protection of the Venetian lagoon system, said contact began in April, well before any protests.",

      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "Five nights a week there will be a \u201cBusted Open After Dark\u201d program, where fans can call in and react after WWE and AEW shows.",
      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",
      "Facing a global existential threat, Gemma is convinced to build a body for M3gan to go toe-to-toe with the military-grade AI killing machine known as Amelia. \u201cEveryone deserves a second chance,\u201d Cady tells her aunt. But whose side is M3gan really on? And what does Amelia really want?",
      "Some of the movie's best parts are when M3gan and Amelia face off. \u201cYou're not family to them,\u201d the new AI model says to the old. \u201cYou're just the help.\u201d There's some cool robotic dancing \u2014 a highlight of the original \u2014 and a return of M3gan's camel-colored silk sateen dress that became popular at Halloween.",
      "Johnstone has smartly kept the offbeat humor of the original, this time with clever nods to \u201cKnight Rider\u201d and a surreal use of the Kate Bush song \u201cThis Woman\u2019s Work.\u201d Jemaine Clement from \u201cFlight of the Conchords\u201d has fun as an arrogant tech billionaire, while Brian Jordan Alvarez and Jen Van Epps return as Gemma\u2019s tech teammates, this time crawling through ducts or getting choked almost to death.",
      "We wouldn't be here if someone had taken the advice of Ronny Chieng's character in the original movie: \u201cI want you to take this cyborg puppet show and put it in a dark closet where it belongs.\u201d Not after grossing $180 million worldwide. \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d was inevitable, but it didn't have to be so inevitably too much.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0,\u201d a Universal Pictures release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 for \u201cstrong violent content, bloody images, some strong language, sexual material and brief drug references.\u201d Running time: 120 minutes. Two stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",

      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know.

      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon wrote: \u201cBobby is a stellar example of the statement \u2018to protect and serve.\u2019 We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\u201d",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \u201cTeen Idols Tour\u201d with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman\u2019s Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman\u2019s performances: \u201cDressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with \u2018Easy Come, Easy Go.\u2019 As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\u201d",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children\u2019s Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health, and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",
      "\u201cEven in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That\u2019s who Bobby was \u2014 brave, gentle, and full of light,\u201d Poublon wrote.",

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",

      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",

      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",

      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",

      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",

TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",

      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",

      "A new Idaho law restricting public benefits for undocumented immigrants is facing a legal challenge",
      "BOISE, Idaho -- An Idaho doctor and four residents are challenging a new state law that halts some of the few public benefits available to people living in the U.S. unlawfully, including a program that provides access to life-saving HIV and AIDS medication for low income patients.",
      "The ACLU of Idaho filed the federal lawsuit Thursday night on behalf of Dr. Abby Davids and four people with HIV who are not named because they are immigrants without lawful permanent residency.",
      "The complaint says the new law is vague, contradicts federal law and makes it impossible for health care providers to determine exactly what kind of immigration status is excluded and how to verify that status for patients. They want a judge to grant them class-action status, expanding any ruling to other impacted people.",
      "Dozens of patients treated by one Boise-area clinic stand to lose access to HIV and AIDS medication under the law, according to the complaint, including several cared for by Davids.",
      "\u201cWithdrawing HIV treatment from her patients will not only have devastating consequences on their health, it raises the public health risk of increased HIV transmission,\u201d the ACLU wrote in the lawsuit. \u201cWhen her patients are undetectable, they cannot transmit the virus. Without HIV treatment, however, they cannot maintain an undetectable viral level and therefore are able to transmit the virus to others.\u201d",
      "The new Idaho law takes effect July 1, and appears to be the first limiting public health benefits since President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies to enhance eligibility verification and ensure that public benefits aren't going to ineligible immigrants.",
      "The law requires people to verify that they are legal U.S. residents to receive public benefits like communicable disease testing, vaccinations, prenatal and postnatal care for women, crisis counseling, some food assistance for children and even access to food banks or soup kitchens that rely on public funding.",
      "Federal law generally prohibits immigrants in the U.S. illegally from receiving taxpayer-funded benefits like Medicare, Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Social Security. But there are some exceptions for things like emergency medical care and other emergency or public health services.",
      "Idaho\u2019s law still allows for emergency medical services. But in a June 18 letter to health care providers, Idaho Division of Public Health administrator Elke Shaw-Tulloch said HIV is a long-term condition and not an emergency \u2014 so people must verify their lawful presence in order to get benefits through the federal Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program.",
      "The HIV patients challenging the new law include a married couple from Columbia with pending asylum applications, a man who was brought to the U.S. when he was just 4 years old and has Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status until next year, and a man from Mexico who has been living and working in Idaho since 2020.",
      "One of the patients said she and her husband were diagnosed with HIV in 2019 and immediately started antiretroviral therapy, receiving the medications at no cost through the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program. The medication has lowered the viral load in her body enough that it is now undetectable, she wrote in a court filing, ensuring that she won't transmit the virus to others.",
      "\u201cMy medication protected my daughter while I was pregnant because it prevented me from transmitting HIV to her during pregnancy,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The treatment allows her to be with her child, watching her grow, she said.",
      "Davids has been trying for weeks to get clarity from the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare about exactly what kind of verification her patients will have to show, and exactly which kinds of immigration status are considered \u201clawful.\u201d But the state has yet to provide clear direction, according to the complaint.",
      "\u201cI am really scared about what this means for many of our patients. Their lives will now be in jeopardy,\u201d Davids wrote in a May 30 email to the Department of Health and Welfare.",

      "Prosecutors said it was the first time a school district in the U.S. has faced such environmental criminal allegations.",
      "The district is charged with eight counts of violating the federal Toxic Substances Control Act for allegedly failing to perform inspections in a timely manner during a recent five-year period.",

      "Asbestos, a construction material in wide use until the 1980s, has been linked to cancer and lung disease.",
      "Investigators said some asbestos was improperly addressed and that schools have had to close as a result of asbestos problems. Prosecutors said the \u201clongstanding and widespread problem\u201d put students and teachers in danger.",

      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",

      "At the panel's meeting Wednesday, Chrissie Juliano, executive director of the Big Cities Health Coalition, lamented the ouster of the former ACIP panel and the agenda of the new one.",
      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "CDC nominee Susan Monarez says she values vaccines and rigorous scientific evidence but has largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F",
      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",
      "Monarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy's decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",
      "The CDC director nominee, Susan Monarez, is slated to go before a Senate committee on Wednesday.",

      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",

      "A West Virginia woman has filed a lawsuit seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",

      "NEW YORK -- An intense and nearly historic weather pattern is cooking much of America under a dangerous heat dome this week with triple-digit temperatures in places that haven't been so hot in more than a decade.",
      "The heat wave is especially threatening because it's hitting cities like Boston, New York and Philadelphia early in the summer when people haven't gotten their bodies adapted to the broiling conditions, several meteorologists said. The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",

      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",

      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief. Many retailers across the state also pointed to the thousands of jobs and millions in revenue the industry brings each year.",

    "story": [
      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "Their rallies at times turned violent and led to military coups in 2006 and 2014, which respectively ousted the elected governments of Thaksin and Paetongtarn\u2019s aunt, former Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra.",
      "Outrage over the recorded phone call mostly revolved around Paetongtarn telling Hun Sen, the current Cambodian Senate president and a longtime friend of her father, not to listen to \u201can opponent\u201d in Thailand. It\u2019s believed to be a reference to the regional Thai army commander in charge of the area where the clash happened, who publicly criticized Cambodia over the border dispute.",
      "Hun Sen on Saturday vowed to protect his country\u2019s territory from foreign invaders and condemned what he called an attack by Thai forces last month.",
      "At a 74th anniversary celebration of the foundation of his long-ruling Cambodian People\u2019s Party, Hun Sen claimed the action by the Thai army was illegal when it engaged Cambodian forces. He said the skirmish inside Cambodian territory was a serious violation of country\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity, despite Cambodia's good will in attempting to resolve the border issue.",
      "\u201cThis poor Cambodia has suffered from foreign invasion, war, and genocide, been surrounded and isolated and insulted in the past but now Cambodia has risen on an equal face with other countries. We need peace, friendship, cooperation, and development the most, and we have no politics and no unfriendly stance with any nation,\u201d Hun Sen said in front of cheerful thousands of party members at the event in the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh.",
      "There is a long history of territorial disputes between the countries. Thailand is still rattled by a 1962 International Court of Justice ruling that awarded Cambodia the disputed territory where the historic Preah Vihear temple stands. There were sporadic though serious clashes there in 2011. The ruling from the U.N. court was reaffirmed in 2013, when Yingluck was prime minister.",
      "The scandal has broken Paetongtarn's fragile coalition government, costing her Pheu Thai Party the loss of its biggest partner, Bhumjaithai Party. There already was a rift between Bhumjaithai and Pheu Thai Party over reports Bhumjaithai would be shuffled out of the powerful Interior Ministry.",
      "Several Bhumjaithai leaders also are under investigation over an alleged rigging of last year's Senate election in which many figures who are reportedly close to the party claimed a majority of seats.",
      "The departure of Bhumjaithai left the 10-party coalition with 255 seats, just above the majority of the 500-seat house.",
      "Paetongtarn also faces investigations by the Constitutional Court and the national anti-corruption agency. Their decisions could lead to her removal from office.",
      "Sarote Phuengrampan, secretary-general of the Office of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, said Wednesday that his agency is investigating Paetongtarn for a serious breach of ethics over the phone call with Hun Sen. He did not give a possible timeline for a decision.",
      "Reports said the Constitutional Court can suspend Paetongtarn from duty pending the investigation and could decide as early as next week whether it will take the case. The prime minister said Tuesday she is not worried and is ready to give evidence to support her case.",
      "\u201cIt was clear from the phone call that I had nothing to gain from it, and I also didn\u2019t cause any damage to the country,\u201d she said.",
      "The court last year removed her predecessor from Pheu Thai over a breach of ethics. Thailand\u2019s courts, especially the Constitutional Court, are considered a bulwark of the country\u2019s royalist establishment, which has used them and nominally independent state agencies such as the Election Commission to cripple or sink political opponents.",

      "PARIS -- Few Paris addresses conjure myth quite like Maxim\u2019s, the gilded Belle \u00c9poque haunt where artists and aristocrats once jostled for a seat at dinner, and a place immortalized in Cole Porter\u2019s lyrics and classic Hollywood films as the very symbol of Parisian chic. On Friday night, at Paris Fashion Week the renowned restaurant-turned-nightclub became the improbable stage for Kenzo\u2019s latest co-ed show \u2014 a riot of pop color, celebrity and cultural collision served tableside.",
      "Guests perched around white tablecloths as Nigo, the first Japanese designer to helm Kenzo since the late, great Kenzo Takada, set out to prove the house can still surprise. What unfolded was a knowingly playful mash-up of preppy classics and off-kilter eveningwear: eye-popping pink dresses loosely gathered and knotted, each one tossed with a Left Bank silk scarf; a slinky tuxedo jacket paired with a blaring urban-printed tee in wild color, topped with a cartoon bunny in intentional clash. Think cocktail hour by way of Shibuya street style.",
      "Tongue-in-cheek references ran rampant \u2014 a circus master\u2019s striped waistcoat here, sheeny tiger-motif pants there, all nodding to Kenzo\u2019s signature mix of high craft and subcultural wink. If the goal was to recapture the house\u2019s historic sense of fun, Nigo went all in.",
      "While the creativity on display was undeniable, the sheer abundance of ideas sometimes made it hard for a single vision to shine through. With so many bold references and layers echoing recent seasons\u2019 spirit of collaboration and eclecticism, the collection sometimes felt more like a lively collage than a focused statement. Still, there were moments where the craftsmanship and playful accessories truly stood out, offering glimpses of the distinct Kenzo spirit that Nigo has made his own.",
      "Since joining Kenzo, Nigo has brought a fresh spirit of collaboration and cross-cultural exchange, most visibly in his headline-grabbing work with Pharrell Williams at Louis Vuitton and his frequent partnerships with artists from across the globe. That outward-looking energy has helped pull Kenzo back into the pop-culture conversation, blending the house\u2019s playful legacy with new momentum. As part of the LVMH stable, Kenzo now enjoys the reach and resources of the world\u2019s largest luxury group, giving Nigo freedom to experiment, push boundaries and reawaken the brand\u2019s irreverent roots.",
      "It was a night that nodded to both past and future. After a string of worn years under the previous design duo, Kenzo seems determined to shake off old dust and reclaim its seat at Paris\u2019 most storied table. The show at Maxim\u2019s \u2014 equal parts fashion circus and cultural memory \u2014 was a reminder that Paris style is best served with a wink, a clash and more than a little mischief.",

      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A deal signed in Washington on Friday has been touted as a major step toward peace in Congo following decades of conflict that has killed millions, including thousands this year.",
      "The U.S.-mediated agreement is between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has been battered by fighting with more than 100 armed groups. The most potent is backed by neighboring Rwanda, and it is not clear if it will abide by the deal as the group wasn't part of the negotiations.",
      "President Donald Trump says the deal gives the United States \u201ca lot of the mineral rights\u201d from Congo. His administration has pushed to gain access to minerals key to much of the world's technology and is seeking to counter China, a key player in the region where the U.S. presence and influence have eroded.",
      "Both the Congolese and Rwandan presidents are expected in Washington in a few weeks to \u201cfinalize the complete protocol and agreement,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said.",
      "Here's a look at what we know about the agreement:",
      "The agreement details general expectations but is short on how it will be implemented, particularly in getting the key actors of the conflict \u2014 the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels \u2014 to lay down their arms, according to a copy seen by The Associated Press.",
      "The deal emphasizes the two neighboring countries' sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful coexistence, with a commitment to halt all hostilities and any support for armed groups.",
      "Although it denies supporting the M23 rebels, Rwanda has said it is protecting its border and going after the ethnic Hutus, whom it accuses of participating in the 1994 Rwandan genocide and now working with Congolese forces after fleeing to the neighboring country.",
      "Armed gangs involved in the conflict may be reintegrated into Congolese security forces only after individual vetting based on loyalty, fitness and human rights records, the deal says.",
      "In what the U.N. has called \u201cone of the most protracted, complex, serious humanitarian crises on Earth,\u201d the deal includes a commitment to protect and facilitate humanitarian access for displaced people in Congo, estimated to be more than 7 million.",
      "The two countries also commit to creating an economic framework \u201cto expand foreign trade and investment derived from regional critical mineral supply chains,\u201d including ones that \u201clink both countries, in partnership, as appropriate, with the U.S. government and U.S. investors.\u201d",
      "Analysts say it is going to be difficult for the M23 rebels to withdraw from the cities they seized during their major advance this year and that such withdrawal may either take a long time or another round of fighting.",
      "Rwanda is estimated to have thousands of troops supporting the M23 rebels in eastern Congo. Even if Rwanda ends its support for the rebels, the M23 has been consolidating its grip in the cities it has seized, setting up local administrative offices and enforcing a new governing structure.",
      "A team of U.N. experts said in a report in December that Rwanda was benefitting from minerals \u201cfraudulently\u201d exported from areas in the region under the control of the M23. Rwanda has denied involvement.",
      "The rebels were not directly involved in the U.S.-facilitated negotiations and have not spoken publicly about the deal. And Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance, which includes the M23, told the AP in March that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe pointed to separate talks happening in Qatar that are meant to get both Congo and the M23 rebels to agree among themselves how they will end the fighting. He also said Rwanda agreed to lift its \"defensive measures.\u201d It was not clear if he meant withdrawing the troops that Rwanda has said are defending its territorial interests.",
      "Of five people that the AP spoke to in the conflict-battered region, none of them was convinced the deal would quickly end the fighting.",
      "They called for caution in granting the U.S. access to the region\u2019s minerals \u2014 resources that even late Pope Francis had reprimanded developed countries for exploiting to the detriment of the Congolese.",
      "\u201cWe draw the attention of the Congolese government not to give in completely or to sell the Congo to the Americans just because the United States has supported us in restoring peace,\u201d said Hangi Muhindo, a resident of Goma, the city at the center of the conflict.",
      "\u201cThe commitments to the United States must not jeopardize the future of our people,\u201d he added.",
      "Some also felt the agreement is only a part of the solution and called for more dialogue and justice.",

      "Leo appealed for unity in a triptych of messages to priests who are celebrating a special Holy Year week in Rome dedicated to clergy. He hosted a special meeting on Thursday afternoon, celebrated an ordination Mass on Friday morning and also delivered a written message to priests around the world.",
      "During the Mass in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, Leo ordained 32 new priests and recalled his appeal for unity during his installation Mass right after his May 8 election.",
      "\u201cToday, I share this desire once more with all of you,\u201d he said. He quoted St. Augustine \u2013 the inspiration of his Augustinian religious order \u2013 in repeating the words he said on the night of his election: \u201cFor you I am a bishop, with you I am a Christian.\u201d",

      "Leo\u2019s consistent reference to unity in the church suggests he has heard those appeals and is working to respond.",
      "In a message to priests around the world Friday, Leo offered encouragement in his appeal for unity, not a browbeating as Francis often gave priests.",
      "\u201cIn a world marked by growing tensions, even within families and ecclesial communities, priests are called to promote reconciliation and foster communion,\u201d Leo said. He added that priests should not be afraid of their own weaknesses. \u201cThe Lord does not look for perfect priests, but for humble hearts that are open to conversion and prepared to love others as he himself loved us,\u201d he said.",
      "He gave a similar message Thursday to thousands of priests who gathered in a Vatican-area auditorium for a Jubilee rally that ended with Leo giving English-language shoutouts to priests from various parts of the world, including his native Chicago.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Russian forces launched 363 Shahed and decoy drones as well as eight missiles at Ukraine overnight, the Ukrainian air force said Friday, claiming that air defenses stopped all but four of the drones and downed six cruise missiles.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said that 39 Ukrainian drones were downed in several regions overnight, including 19 over the Rostov region and 13 over the Volgograd region. Both regions lie east of Ukraine.",
      "Long-range drone strikes have been a hallmark of the war, now in its fourth year. The race by both sides to develop increasingly sophisticated and deadlier drones has turned the war into a testing ground for new weaponry.",
      "The Ukrainian air force said that 359 incoming drones were either intercepted or electronically jammed.",
      "The Ukrainian attack forced three Russian airports to briefly suspend flights, officials said. The authorities also briefly closed the Crimean Bridge overnight as drones targeted Crimea.",
      "Neither Russia nor Ukraine reported any major damage or casualties in the attacks.",
      "Russia manufactures Shahed drones based on an original Iranian model, churning out thousands of them at a plant in the Tatarstan region. It has upgraded the Shaheds with its own innovations, including bigger warheads.",
      "They are known as suicide drones because they nosedive into targets and explode on impact, like a missile. The incessant buzzing of the propeller-driven Shahed drones is unnerving for anyone under its flight path because no one on the ground knows exactly when or where the weapon will hit.",
      "Being outgunned and outnumbered in the war against its bigger neighbor, Ukraine also has developed its own cutting-edge drone technology, including long-range sea drones, and has trained thousands of drone pilots.",

      "Those drones, fitted with onboard cameras that give their operators a real-time view of possible targets, have also struck civilian areas.",
      "The U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine said in a report published Thursday that short-range drone attacks killed at least 395 civilians and injured 2,635 between the start of the war and last April. Almost 90% of the attacks were by the Russian armed forces, it reported.",
      "The strikes not only spread fear among civilians but also severely disrupt daily life by restricting movement and limiting access to food and medical services, the report said.",

      "German lawmakers have voted to suspend family reunions for many migrants",
      "BERLIN -- German lawmakers voted Friday to suspend family reunions for many migrants, part of a drive by the new conservative-led government for a tougher approach to migration.",
      "Parliament's lower house voted 444-135 to suspend the possibility of family reunions for two years for migrants who have \u201csubsidiary protection,\u201d a status that falls short of asylum.",
      "At the end of March, more than 388,000 people living in Germany had the status, which was granted to many people fleeing Syria's civil war.",
      "New Chancellor Friedrich Merz made tougher migration policy a central plank of his campaign for Germany\u2019s election in February. Just after he took office in early May, the government stationed more police at the border and said some asylum-seekers trying to enter Europe\u2019s biggest economy would be turned away.",
      "The bill approved Friday is the first legislation on migration since Merz took office. It will suspend rules dating to 2018 that allowed up to 1,000 close relatives per month to join the migrants granted limited protection, with authorities making case-by-case decisions on humanitarian grounds rather than granting an automatic right for reunions.",
      "Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt told lawmakers that the change would result in 12,000 fewer people being able to come to Germany each year and \u201cbreak a business model\u201d for smugglers.",
      "People often know they won't get full recognition as refugees, \u201cbut they set off for Germany because it is known that, even without asylum recognition ... you can have your family follow,\" Dobrindt said. \"That is a significant pull effect and we are removing this pull effect today.\u201d",
      "Dobrindt said \u201cour country's capacity for integration simply has a limit.\u201d",
      "Liberal opposition lawmakers decried the government's approach. Marcel Emmerich, of the Greens, described the legislation as \u201can attack on the core of every society, on a truly central value \u2014 the family.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnyone who wants integration must bring families together,\u201d he said.",
      "The far-right, anti-migration Alternative for Germany described the move as a very small step in the right direction.",
      "German governments have for years faced pressure to curb migration as shelters across the country filled up. The administration of Merz's predecessor, Olaf Scholz, already had taken some measures including the introduction of checks on all Germany's borders.",
      "Asylum applications declined from 329,120 in 2023 to 229,751 last year and have continued to fall this year.",

      "Lauded by President Trump last week as \u201ca Great Day for Africa and ... for the World,\u201d the crucial deal comes as part of other ongoing peace talks to end the conflict, including ones mediated by the African Union as well as Qatar.",
      "The agreement involves provisions on respect for territorial integrity, a prohibition of hostilities as well as the disengagement, disarmament and conditional integration of non-state armed groups, U.S. State Department deputy spokesperson Tommy Pigott told reporters on Thursday.",
      "U.N. spokesperson Stephane Dujarric also said on Thursday that such a deal is welcomed, adding: \u201cWe talk almost every day about \u2026 the horrific suffering of civilians, the hunger, the sexual violence, the constant fear, the constant displacement\u201d in eastern Congo.",
      "Congo hopes the U.S. will provide it with the security support needed to fight the rebels and possibly get them to withdraw from the key cities of Goma and Bukavu, and from the entire region where Rwanda is estimated to have up to 4,000 troops. Rwanda has said it is defending its territorial interests and not supporting the M23.",
      "However, the M23 rebels have suggested the agreement won\u2019t be binding on them. The rebel group has not been directly involved in the planned peace deal although it has been part of other ongoing peace talks.",
      "Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance that includes the M23, told the Associated Press in March that direct peace talks with Congo can only be held if the country acknowledges their grievances and that \u201canything regarding us which are done without us, it\u2019s against us.\u201d",
      "An M23 spokesman, Oscar Balinda, also echoed those thoughts in an interview with AP this week, saying the U.S.-facilitated deal does not concern the rebels.",
      "Analysts say the U.S. government\u2019s commitment might depend on how much access it has to the minerals being discussed under a separate minerals deal being negotiated.",
      "The mostly untapped minerals \u2014 estimated to be worth as much as $24 trillion by the U.S. Department of Commerce \u2014 are critical to much of the world\u2019s technology.",
      "Christian Moleka, a political scientist at the Congolese think tank Dypol, called the planned deal a \u201cmajor turning point\u201d in the decadeslong conflict, but that the signing could \"in no way eliminate all the issues of the conflict.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe current draft agreement ignores war crimes and justice for victims by imposing a partnership between the victim and the aggressor,\u201d he said. \u201cThis seems like a trigger-happy proposition and cannot establish lasting peace without justice and reparation.\u201d",
      "In Congo's North Kivu province, the hardest hit by the fighting, some believe the peace deal will help resolve the violence but warn justice must still be served for an enduring peace to take hold.",
      "\u201cI don't think the Americans should be trusted 100%,\u201d said Hope Muhinuka, an activist from the province. \u201cIt is up to us to capitalize on all we have now as an opportunity.\u201d",

      "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Keir Starmer gave way to political pressure on Friday, watering down planned welfare reforms to avoid defeat by his own party\u2019s lawmakers. It\u2019s the latest forced U-turn for a center-left government caught between conflicting goals of cutting spending and improving public services.",
      "The government planned to bring a bill to Parliament next week that would tighten eligibility for a key disability benefit, removing the Personal Independence Payment from hundreds of thousands of people with long-term physical or mental health conditions. Another health-related benefit received by people on low incomes would also be reduced under the plans.",
      "The government said the proposed changes would help people find jobs while preserving a safety net for those who can never work. It would also save an estimated 5 billion pounds ($7 billion) a year from a welfare bill that has ballooned since the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "But many Labour lawmakers balked at the changes, which the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank estimated would cut the income of 3.2 million people by 2030.",
      "More than 120 of the 403 Labour legislators signed a motion that would effectively kill the bill if it were to be passed. Defeat at the hands of his own party in the vote planned for Tuesday would have seriously damaged Starmer\u2019s authority.",
      "To avoid that, the government said no existing recipients would lose either the PIP benefit or an additional payment given to those whose health conditions limit their ability to work.",
      "It seems that much of the opposition has melted away as a result of the overnight concessions, though some on the left of Labour look like they will vote against the bill unless the government rows back further.",
      "Meg Hillier, the chair of the influential Treasury Select Committee and a high-profile rebel, said the changes announced are \u201cpositive\" and show the government is willing to listen.",
      "\u201cI have already had a flurry of messages from people saying they feel this is a good step forward,\u201d she told the BBC.",

      "Starmer was elected a year ago in a landslide victory, winning a commanding majority of seats in the House of Commons. Since then his popularity has plunged as a sluggish economy and stubbornly high inflation resist efforts to raise living standards and ease a cost-of-living squeeze.",
      "Even as Starmer enjoyed success on the world stage \u2014 charming U.S. President Donald Trump and securing a trade deal to exempt Britain from some U.S. tariffs \u2014 Labour lawmakers have grown restive at the party\u2019s sagging poll ratings and the rise of the hard-right Reform U.K. party led by Nigel Farage.",
      "Starmer has been forced into several U-turns. In May, the government dropped a plan to end winter home heating subsidies for millions of retirees. Last week, Starmer announced a national inquiry into organized child sexual abuse, something he was pressured to do by opposition politicians \u2014 and Elon Musk.",
      "Starmer, who just a few days ago was adamant there would be no changes to the planned welfare reforms, sought to put a brave face on his latest about-turn.",
      "\u201cI have listened to colleagues who have rightly shared ways for us to improve our changes,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we are taking those improvements forward.\u201d",
      "Starmer insisted that major changes to welfare are needed to deal with a \u201cbroken\u201d system inherited from the previous Conservative government.",
      "The government said spending cuts would be balanced by new money and support to help people who are able to work to find jobs. It also said that it wants to reduce the number of working-age people who are economically inactive through long-term sickness, which it said stands at 2.8 million, the highest rate of any G7 nation.",
      "Though the U-turns may ease some of the political pressures on the government, they come at a cost.",
      "The Resolution Foundation, a think tank that focuses its work on those on lower incomes, said the changes to welfare and heating subsidies will cost the government 4 billion pounds ($5.5 billion), which will have to be found in the next budget in the fall. This comes at a time when money is scarce given the state of the public finances, international uncertainty and low economic growth.",
      "The latest changes pile pressure on Treasury chief Rachel Reeves, who is widely blamed for pushing the cuts in the first place, as she prepares her next budget. Most economists think that it is likely she will have to raise taxes again.",

      "Officials said during the meeting that shops that are currently licensed can continue to operate but they must get their products only from pharmaceutical-grade farms that are certified by the department, and must declare sources of their products to authorities every month. Those farms must also acquire a license for selling cannabis. The order says shops can only sell a limited amount of cannabis to those with a prescription, enough for personal use in 30 days.",

      "She said shops that violate the order will be closed and the ministry will also tighten requirements for approval of a new license in the future. She said there are curently about 18,000 shops that hold a license to sell cannabis.",
      "Chokwan argued that the rules were already in place, but what was lacking was the enforcement. She also said the abrupt change was politically motivated.",
      "\u201cWe know we need regulation. We need control. The existing rule that is in the announcement previously needs to be enforced. Can we enforce that first? Before we move on to something that is harder and people don\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Iranian Kurdish dissidents have been watching from abroad for signs that the government in Tehran might falter after the 12-day Israel-Iran war",
      "IRBIL, Iraq -- From abroad, Iranian Kurdish dissident groups have been watching closely for signs that Iran\u2019s theocracy could falter in its grip on the country, battered by Israeli airstrikes in the intense, 12-day war until a U.S.-negotiated ceasefire halted the fighting.",
      "Israel launched the strikes on June 13, drawing Iranian missiles that targeted Israel. But it was not until the United States inserted itself into the war and hit Iranian nuclear sites on Sunday, including with 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs, that the war came to a watershed moment.",
      "Now, with the fragile ceasefire holding and many Iranians trying to return to a normal life, questions swirl about whether and how much the war has weakened Iran's clerical rule, in place since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.",
      "A handful of Iranian Kurdish groups \u2014 many with a distinctly militant past \u2014 have long found a safe haven in northern Iraq\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdish region, but their presence has been a point of friction between the central government in Baghdad and Tehran.",
      "Iraq in 2023 reached an agreement with Iran to disarm the groups and move them from their bases near the border areas with Iran \u2014 where they potentially posed an armed challenge to Tehran \u2014 into camps designated by Baghdad.",
      "Their armed bases were shut down and their movement within Iraq restricted, but the groups have not entirely given up their weapons.",
      "Officials with two prominent Iranian Kurdish groups in Iraq told The Associated Press they are trying to organize politically to ensure that they would not be sidelined should the administration in Iran lose its hold on power.",
      "When asked if their groups were preparing an armed uprising, they either denied it or avoided a direct response.",
      "President Donald Trump floated the idea of \u201cregime change\u201d in Tehran in the wake of the U.S. strikes, only to have his administration later say that was not the goal. Some of the Kurdish dissidents say they expect no immediate upheaval in Iran's ruling theocracy.",
      "\u201cSome of the parties think this war between Iran and Israel is a good opportunity for us\u201d to advance the Kurdish cause, said Khalil Naderi, spokesperson for the Kurdistan Freedom Party, or PAK, a separatist Iranian Kurdish group based in Iraq.",
      "But Naderi disagreed with that premise. \"The U.S. and Israel attacked Iran to protect themselves from its weapons, not for Kurdish rights,\u201d he said.",
      "Any premature armed mobilization on their part could endanger both the Kurdish groups and the fragile security of the Kurdish areas, both in Iraq and across the border in Iran, Naderi said.",
      "His stand was a contrast to that of PAK leader Hussein Yazdanpanah, who days after the outbreak of the Israel-Iran war, called on X for Kurdish youth to rise against the authorities in Tehran.",
      "\u201cAttack the enemy, its centers, and its facilities\u201d and \u201cavenge the blood\" of their fallen, Yazdanpanah posted.",
      "And last week in Washington, where he had been pushing U.S. officials to include the Kurds in plans for a potential \u201cday after\u201d in Iran, Abdullah Mohtadi, the head of the leftist Komala Party from Iran's Kurdish regions, said he hopes the Israel-Iran war could represent a turning point.",
      "\u201cWar can bring about internal domestic change,\" he said. \"We hope that this time this will be the case.\u201d",
      "Mohtadi denied that any external player, including the U.S. and Israel, had encouraged Kurdish groups to take up arms. But he didn't rule out the possibility that they would.",
      "\u201cWe haven\u2019t at the moment called for an uprising, or we haven\u2019t called for an armed struggle, but we are monitoring developments very closely,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohtadi maintained that Komala has avoided an armed struggle for nearly 30 years and that its camps in northern Iraq are purely for \u201cself defense.\u201d",
      "Both Komala and the PAK, as well as another exiled Kurdish group, the Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan or KDPI, have fought Iranian authorities in the past \u2014 but also sometimes fought against each other.",
      "The groups have different approaches to the question of Kurdish separatism. PAK advocates for an independent Kurdish state, while Komala and KDPI want a system in Iran similar to that in northern Iraq, where Iraqi Kurds have a semiautonomous and self-governed region.",
      "Iran has occasionally launched strikes on the Iranian Kurdish dissidents, but none during the Israel-Iran war this month.",
      "The dissident groups are walking a fine line, balancing the differences among themselves and with their hosts in Iraq, the Iraqi Kurds and the Iraqi government in Baghdad \u2014 neither of which they want to antagonize.",
      "Despite having shared grievances over the marginalization of Kurds in Iran, the Iranian Kurdish parties have not been able to build a consensus",
      "\"We haven\u2019t been able to unite, even though we would like to,\u201d Naderi said.",
      "In March, ahead of Nowruz, the Persian New Year, the Kurdish dissident groups had planned to \u201cmeet and discuss\" Kurdish rights and destiny, but plans fell through. Even now, he said, coordination remains elusive.",
      "Kawsar Fattahi, a central committee member of Komala, said the dissidents should not plan for \u201cthe fall of the regime, but on what will happen after that.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause our goal is to rebuild a new Iran,\u201d she said.",
      "Mohtadi, the Komala leader, said he has tried to reassure Washington that his group is not separatist but wants a \u201cdemocratic, secular federal Iran where the rights of Kurds and other ethnic groups are protected by the new constitution.\u201d",
      "He denied anyone is pushing Komala into armed conflict.",
      "\u201cWe aren\u2019t puppets,\u201d Mohtadi said. \u201cNobody has asked us to rise (up). We will decide when is the right time.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Brazil's first lady, Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, is drawing attention for her outspoken role in politics",
      "SAO PAULO -- In early May, an air of triumph filled a dinner in Beijing, where Brazil's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva celebrated a diplomatic victory: businessmen travelling with him said they had secured billions of dollars in investments as the veteran leader renewed his international prestige standing alongside his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.",
      "But then Brazilian first lady Ros\u00e2ngela da Silva, better known as Janja, raised her hand.",
      "Although no one was expected to speak, da Silva addressed Xi, saying that Chinese social media company TikTok posed a challenge for leftists, claiming its algorithm favors right-wingers. China's president reportedly answered. The exchange was leaked to Brazilian media by the time dessert was served.",
      "Lula\u2019s government is grappling with unpopularity that has dented his credentials as the frontrunner for reelection next year. Some analysts, including members of his government, attribute this partly to his wife\u2019s perceived overstepping in what was once a ceremonial role.",
      "Janja, a 58-year-old sociologist, has drawn criticism for insulting tech billionaire Elon Musk, mocking the suicide of a pro-Jair Bolsonaro supporter and advising the president on how to use the military during the Jan. 8, 2023 riots in the capital, Brasilia. Still, she insists she will speak out whenever it serves the public interest.",
      "A Datafolha poll released June 12 found that 36% of Brazilians think the first lady\u2019s actions hurt the government, while 14% say they are helpful. It was the pollster's first measure of the first lady's approval.",
      "The same poll showed Lula with a 40% job disapproval rating, an 8 percentage point increase from October 2024.",
      "Brazil\u2019s presidency said in a statement to The Associated Press on June 20 that da Silva adheres to the solicitor-general\u2019s office guidelines, adding that she \u201cacts as a citizen, combining her public visibility with the experience she has built throughout her professional career in support of relevant social issues and matters of public interest.\u201d",
      "Under guidelines published by the solicitor-general\u2019s office, the president\u2019s spouse primarily fulfills \u201ca symbolically representative role on behalf of the president in a social, cultural, ceremonial, political or diplomatic nature.\" For many of her critics, this does not grant her the authority to speak as a government representative.",
      "Brazilian media have reported that government ministers, lawmakers and staunch leftist campaigners are privately raising concerns about the first lady being a hindrance more than an asset. These worries have skyrocketed since the incident in China \u2014 even as Lula himself has praised his wife for speaking out.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Brazil is governed by a couple,\u201d said Beatriz Rey, a political science postdoctoral and research fellow at the University of Lisbon. \u201cWhen (the first lady) says there won\u2019t be any protocols to silence her, she disrespects our democratic institutions for she has no elected office, no government position. It is not about being a woman or a feminist. It is undue interference.\u201d",
      "Lula\u2019s first wife, Maria de Lourdes, died in 1971. His second, Marisa Let\u00edcia, died in 2017. Lula, 79, and Janja said they met in 2017 and started seeing each other frequently during the leftist leader's 580 days in jail in the city of Curitiba between 2018 and 2019. They married in 2022.",
      "Many supporters of Lula's Workers' Party partly attribute the criticism against the first lady to misinformation and disinformation. In May, the party launched the \u201cI am with Janja\u201d social media campaign in her defense. But the week-long effort garnered less than 100,000 views and only a few hundred comments.",
      "\u201cJanja is an asset because she rejuvenates Lula, everyone in the government understands that, even her critics,\u201d a Brazilian government source told the AP. \u201cNo one wants to alienate her. But many important people in Brasilia, friends and allies of Lula, do understand that by overstepping she brings some of her rejection to the president.\u201d",
      "The source, who spoke under condition of anonymity for lack of authorization to speak about the matter publicly, often travels with the president and the first lady.",
      "Adriana Negreiros, a journalist who profiled the first lady for a 2024 podcast titled \u201cJanja,\u201d said that allies of the president who criticize her do it with extreme caution.",
      "\u201d(Janja) dances, sings, speaks out, appears at official events and meetings with heads of state. She insists on being present and vocal,\u201d Negreiros said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sexism and misogyny directed at her, no doubt. But not all criticism is sexist.\u201d",
      "Da Silva said she doesn't go to dinners \u201cjust to accompany\" her husband.",
      "\u201cI have common sense. I consider myself an intelligent person. So I know very well what my limits are. I\u2019m fully aware of that,\" she told a podcast of daily Folha de S. Paulo.",
      "Da Silva did, however, express remorse during the same podcast for the expletive she used against Musk in 2024, once a close ally of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Many of Lula's adversaries say they want the first lady to remain in the spotlight.",
      "\u201cThe more she speaks, the more she holds a microphone, the more she helps the right wing,\u201d said Nikolas Ferreira, one of Brazil's most popular right-wing lawmakers.",
      "Ferreira, a prominent social media figure, claims the role of regulating social media is a matter for Brazil's Congress, not for the first lady to debate with foreign leaders like Xi.",
      "Da Silva is also expected to play as a keen hostess at the BRICS summit in Rio on July 6-7, a role her husband is almost certain not to oppose.",
      "\u201cShe will be wherever she wants,\" Lula told journalists in March following criticism for sending the first lady as his representative to a nutrition summit in Paris that month.",
      "\u201cShe will say what she wants and go wherever she wants.\"",

      "Police have detained six Americans in South Korea for allegedly trying to send 1,600 plastic bottles filled with rice, U.S. dollars bills and Bibles toward North Korea by sea",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Six Americans were detained Friday in South Korea for trying to send 1,600 plastic bottles filled with rice, miniature Bibles, $1 bills and USB sticks toward North Korea by sea, police said.",
      "The Americans were apprehended on front-line Gwanghwa Island before throwing the bottles into the sea so they could float toward North Korean shores on the tides, two Gwanghwa police officers said. They said the Americans are being investigated on allegations they violated the law on the management of safety and disasters.",
      "The officers, who requested anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to media on the issue, refused to provide personal details of the Americans in line with privacy rules.",
      "Gwanghwa police said they haven't found what is on the USB sticks.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in South Korea had no immediate public comment.",
      "For years, activists have sought to float plastic bottles or fly balloons across the border carrying anti-North Korea propaganda leaflets and USB thumb drives carrying South Korean dramas and K-pop songs, a practice that was banned from 2021-2023 over concerns it could inflame tensions with the North.",
      "North Korea has responded to previous balloon campaigns with fiery rhetoric and other shows of anger, and last year the country launched its own balloons across the border, dumping rubbish on various South Korean sites including the presidential compound.",
      "In 2023, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court struck down a controversial law that criminalized the sending of leaflets and other items to North Korea, calling it an excessive restriction on free speech.",
      "But since taking office in early June, the new liberal government of President Lee Jae Myung is pushing to crack down on such civilian campaigns with other safety-related laws to avoid a flare-up tensions with North Korea and promote the safety of frontline South Korean residents.",
      "On June 14, police detained an activist for allegedly flying balloons toward North Korea from Gwanghwa Island.",
      "Lee took office with a promise to restart long-dormant talks with North Korea and establish peace on the Korean Peninsula. Lee's government halted frontline anti-Pyongyang propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts to try to ease military tensions. North Korean broadcasts have not been heard in South Korean front-line towns since then.",
      "But it's unclear if North Korea will respond to Lee's conciliatory gesture after vowing last year to sever relations with South Korea and abandon the goal of peaceful Korean reunification. Official talks between the Koreas have been stalled since 2019, when U.S.-led diplomacy on North Korean denuclearization derailed.",

      "The court ruled that only Congress can investigate alleged irregularities in the financing of Petro's 2022 campaign. Petro has denied any financial impropriety.",
      "The ruling scraps a probe by the National Electoral Council into whether Petro's campaign exceeded fundraising limits by about $1.2 million and whether it accepted funds from labor organizations, which is banned by Colombian law.",
      "The council is an administrative body that supervises the electoral process and oversees campaign financing. It can also impose administrative sanctions, such as hefty fines against campaign staffers.",
      "The court ordered the electoral council to refer its investigation to Colombia\u2019s House of Representatives.",
      "It's unclear whether lawmakers will advance the case. Although Petro often clashes with Congress, lawmakers have never removed a Colombian president from office, even in the face of intense public pressure when investigators in 1996 demonstrated then-President Ernesto Samper's ties to drug cartel financing.",

      "In a remarks to reporters Thursday, authorities revealed further details about their efforts to locate Mac\u00edas and the hiding place where he spent his final weeks as a fugitive.",
      "Authorities had issued an international arrest warrant for Mac\u00edas, who was serving a 34-year prison sentence for drug trafficking, organized crime and murder in a Guayaquil prison before his shock escape. Mac\u00edas is also wanted by the United States on accusations of trafficking drugs and smuggling weapons.",
      "A month ago, authorities closed in on the drug trafficker's family, arresting several of his relatives, seizing their assets and raiding their businesses. Interior Minister John Reimberg described the crackdown on Mac\u00edas\u2019 family as a \u201cpsychological operation\u201d crucial to security forces' efforts to locate the notorious leader of Ecuador's \u201cLos Choneros\" gang.",
      "\u201cIt contributes to a person's conflict, their loss of control,\u201d he said in a press conference Thursday.",

Los Choneros is believed to have been one of the first from Ecuador to forge ties with Mexican drug cartels.",
      "Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez also said that authorities received final confirmation that Mac\u00edas would be in the house at the time of the 10-hourlong raid from his young daughter.",
      "In the predawn darkness Wednesday, hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and security officers stormed the mansion and blocked off the surrounding streets. But Mac\u00edas was nowhere to be found.",
      "Security forces flew drones overhead and noticed that the land around the house appeared uneven, with suspiciously altered vegetation that suggested infrastructure and possible ventilation below the surface.",
      "The fugitive was hunkered down in an air-conditioned bunker that could only be accessed through a small hatch, its entrance concealed by a cement and tile floor in the laundry room and openable only from the inside.",
      "Police brought in heavy machinery to start excavating, and when the roof above his head began to cave in Mac\u00edas recognized that capture was inevitable, Minister Reimberg said. The alternative was being crushed to death.",
      "\u201cWhen this happened, Fito panicked,\u201d he said. \u201cHe opened the hatch where military and police personnel were located and left the hole.\u201d",

      "Ecuador\u2019s President Daniel Noboa announced after the capture that the Mac\u00edas would be extradited to the U.S. to face prosecution. He was indicted in New York City in April on charges of importing and distributing thousands of pounds of cocaine in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe have done our part,\u201d Reimberg said. \u201cI expect the U.S. extradition request to arrive in the next few hours or at most the next few days.\"",

      "Former Juventus vice president Pavel Nedved requested a deal of 14 months and former Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici and chief legal officer Cesare Gabasio each requested 18 months.",
      "Prosecutors began investigating in 2021 whether Juventus, which is listed on the Milan stock exchange, cashed in on illegal commissions from transfer and loans of players. The case has also explored whether investors were misled with invoices being issued for non-existent transactions to demonstrate income that in turn could be deemed false accounting.",
      "A decision in the case, which was moved from Turin to Rome, is expected in September, a preliminary judge announced Friday.",
      "The case prompted Agnelli and Juventus\u2019 entire board of directors to resign in 2022. Agnelli was then given two separate bans by sports authorities, the last of which expires in October.",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "Brazil\u2019s Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office has signed a landmark agreement with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to limit the use of its satellite internet service in illegal mining and other criminal operations in the Amazon",
      "Brasilia, BRAZIL -- Brazil\u2019s Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office announced Friday a deal with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink to curb the use of its services in illegal mining and other criminal activities in the Amazon.",
      "Starlink\u2019s lightweight, high-speed internet system has rapidly spread across the Amazon, a region that for decades struggled with slow and unreliable connectivity. But the service has also been adopted by criminal organizations, which have used it to coordinate logistics, make payments and receive alerts about police raids.",
      "It's the first agreement of its kind aimed at curbing such use following years of pressure from Brazilian authorities.",
      "Starlink, a division of Musk's SpaceX, will begin requiring identification and proof of residence from all new users in Brazil\u2019s Amazon region starting in January. The company will also provide Brazilian authorities with user registration and geolocation data for internet units located in areas under investigation.",
      "If a terminal is confirmed to be used for illegal activity, Starlink has committed to blocking the service. The deal is for two years and can be renewed.",
      "Illegal gold mining has contaminated hundreds of miles of Amazon rivers with mercury and disrupted the traditional lives of several Indigenous tribes, including the Yanomami. Starlink, which first arrived in the region in 2022, has enabled criminal groups to manage mining operations in remote areas, where logistics are complex and equipment and fuel must be transported by small plane or boat.",
      "\u201cThe use of satellite internet has transformed the logistics of illegal mining. This new reality demands a proportional legal response. With the agreement, connectivity in remote areas also becomes a tool for environmental responsibility and respect for sovereignty,\u201d federal prosecutor Andr\u00e9 Porreca said in a statement.",
      "Illegal gold miners and loggers have always had some form of communication, mainly via radio, to evade law enforcement. Starlink, with its fast and mobile internet, has significantly enhanced that capability, Hugo Loss, operations coordinator for Brazil\u2019s environmental agency, told The Associated Press in a phone interview.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve been able to transmit in real time the locations of enforcement teams, allowing them to anticipate our arrival, which seriously compromises the safety of our personnel and undermines the effectiveness of operations,\u201d Loss said. \u201cCutting the signal in mining areas, especially on Indigenous lands and in protected areas, is essential because internet access in these locations serves only criminal purposes.\u201d",
      "Jair Schmitt, head of environmental protection for the agency, said what\u2019s also needed is tighter regulation on the sale and use of such equipment.",
      "The AP emailed James Gleeson, SpaceX\u2019s vice president of communications, with questions about the deal, but didn't immediately receive a response.",

      "The U.S. and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The United States and China have reached an agreement \u2014 again \u2014 to deescalate trade tensions. But details are scarce, and the latest pact leaves major issues between the world's two biggest economies unresolved.",
      "President Donald Trump said late Thursday that a deal with China had been signed \"the other day.'' China's Commerce Ministry confirmed Friday that some type of arrangement had been reached but offered few details about it.",
      "Sudden shifts and a lack of clarity have been hallmarks of Trump's trade policy since he returned to the White House determined to overturn a global trading system that he says is unfair to the United States and its workers.",
      "He's been engaged for months in a battle with China that has mostly revealed how much pain the two countries can inflict on each other. And he's racing against a July 8 deadline to reach deals with other major U.S. trading partners.",
      "The uncertainty over his dealmaking and the cost of the tariffs, which are paid by U.S. importers and usually passed on to consumers, have raised worries about the outlook for the U.S. economy. And although analysts welcomed the apparent easing of tensions with China, they also warned that the issues dividing Washington and Beijing are unlikely to be resolved anytime soon.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Friday that the Chinese had agreed to make it easier for American firms to acquire Chinese magnets and rare earth minerals critical for manufacturing and microchip production. Beijing had slowed exports of the materials amid a bitter trade dispute with the Trump administration.",
      "Without explicitly mentioning U.S. access to rare earths, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said that \u201cChina will, in accordance with the law, review and approve eligible export applications for controlled items. In turn, the United States will lift a series of restrictive measures it had imposed on China.''",
      "The Chinese have complained about U.S. controls on exports of advanced U.S. technology to China. But the ministry statement did not specifically say whether the United States planned to ease or lift those controls.",
      "In his interview on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Bessent mentioned that the United States had earlier imposed \u201ccountermeasures'' against China and \u201dhad held back some vital supplies for them.''",
      "\"What we\u2019re seeing here is a de-escalation under President Trump\u2019s leadership,'' Bessent said, without spelling out what concessions the United States had made or whether they involved America's export controls.",
      "Jeff Moon, a trade official in the Obama administration who now runs the China Moon Strategies consultancy, wondered why Trump hadn\u2019t disclosed details of the agreement two days after it had been reached.",
      "\u201cSilence regarding the terms suggests that there is less substance to the deal than the Trump Administration implies,\u2033 said Moon, who also served as a diplomat in China.",
      "The agreement that emerged Thursday and Friday builds on a \"framework'' that Trump announced June 11 after two days of high-level U.S.-China talks in London. Then, he announced, China had agreed to ease restrictions on rare earths. In return, the United States said it would stop seeking to revoke the visas of Chinese students on U.S. college campuses.",
      "And last month, after another meeting in Geneva, the two countries had agreed to dramatically reduce massive taxes they'd slapped on each other's products, which had reached as high as 145% against China and 125% against the U.S.",
      "Those triple-digit tariffs threatened to effectively end trade between the United States and China and caused a frightening sell-off in financial markets. In Geneva, the two countries agreed to back off and keep talking: America\u2019s tariffs went back down to a still-high 30% and China\u2019s to 10%. That led to the talks in London earlier this month and to this week's announcement.",
      "If nothing else, the two countries are trying to ratchet down tensions after demonstrating how much they can hurt each other.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. and China appear to be easing the chokeholds they had on each other\u2019s economies through export controls on computer chips and rare earth minerals, respectively,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"This is a positive step but a far cry from signaling prospects of a substantial de-escalation of tariffs and other trade hostilities.''",
      "Trump launched a trade war with China in his first term, imposing tariffs on most Chinese goods in a dispute over China's attempts to supplant U.S. technological supremacy. Trump's trade team charged that China was unfairly subsidizing its own tech companies, forcing U.S. and other foreign companies to hand over sensitive technology in exchange for access to the Chinese market and even engaging outright theft of trade secrets.",
      "The squabbling and negotiating of the past few months appear to have done little to resolve Washington's complaints about unfair Chinese trade practices and America's massive trade deficit with China, which came to $262 billion last year.",
      "This week's agreement \u201cincludes absolutely nothing related to the U.S.\u2019s concerns regarding China\u2019s trade surplus or non-market behavior,'' said Scott Kennedy of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \u201dIf the two sides can implement these elements of the ceasefire, then they could begin negotiations on issues which generated the initial escalation in tensions in the first place.''",
      "Since returning to the White House in January, Trump has made aggressive use of tariffs. In addition to his levies on China, he has imposed \"baseline'' 10% taxes on imports from every country in the world . And he's announced even higher taxes \u2014 so-called reciprocal tariffs ranging from 11% to 50% \u2014 on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit.",
      "But after financial markets sank on fears of massive disruption to world trade, Trump suspended the reciprocal levies for 90 days to give countries a chance to negotiate reductions in their barriers to U.S. exports. That pause lasts until July 8.",
      "On Friday, Bessent told Fox Business Network that the talks could extend beyond the deadline and be \u201cwrapped up by Labor Day\u2019\u2019 Sept. 1 with 10 to 12 of America's most important trading partners.",
      "Trump further played down the July 8 deadline at a White House press conference Friday by noting that negotiations are ongoing but that \u201cwe have 200 countries, you could say 200 countries-plus. You can't do that.\u201d",
      "Instead of new trade deals, Trump said his administration would in coming days or weeks send out a letter where \u201cwe're just gonna tell them what they have to pay to do business in the United States.''",
      "Separately, Trump took sudden aim at Canada Friday, saying on social media that he's immediately suspending trade talks with that country over its plan to impose a tax on technology firms next Monday. Trump called Canada's digital services tax \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d",
      "The digital services tax will hit companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, Uber and Airbnb with a 3% levy on revenue from Canadian users. It will apply retroactively, leaving U.S. companies with a $2 billion bill due at the end of the month.",

      "The Federal Reserve said all major banks passed this year\u2019s stress tests, showing they can withstand a hypothetical severe economic downturn",
      "NEW YORK -- All the major banks passed the Federal Reserve's annual \u201cstress tests\" of the financial system, the central bank said Friday, but the test conducted by the central bank was notably less vigorous than it had been in previous years.",
      "All 22 banks tested this year would have remained solvent and above the minimum thresholds to continue to operate, the Fed said, despite absorbing roughly $550 billion in theoretical losses. In the Fed's scenario, there would be less of a rise in unemployment, less of a severe economic contraction, less of a drop in commercial real estate prices, less of a drop in housing prices, among other metrics compared to what they tested in 2024.",
      "All of these less harmful, but simulated, drops mean there would be less damage to these banks' balance sheets and less risk of these banks of potentially failing. Since the banks passed the 2024 tests, it was expected that the banks would pass the 2025 tests.",
      "\u201cLarge banks remain well capitalized and resilient to a range of severe outcomes,\u201d said Michelle Bowman, the bank's vice chair for supervision, in a statement. An appointee of President Trump, Bowman became the Fed's vice chair of supervision earlier this month.",
      "It\u2019s not clear why the Fed chose to go with a less vigorous test this year. In a statement, the bank said previous tests had shown \u201cunintended volatility\u201d in the results and it plans to seek public and industry comment to adjust stress tests in future years. The Fed also chose to not test the banks as heavily on their exposure to private equity assets, arguing that private equity assets are typically held for the long term and are not typically sold at times of distress.",
      "The Fed also didn\u2019t test for any bank exposure to private credit, a $2 trillion asset class that even Fed researchers themselves have observed to be growing alarmingly quickly. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston recently pointed out that private credit could be a systemic risk to the financial system under a severe adverse scenario, which is exactly what the stress tests are supposed to test for.",
      "There was no wording or phrasing in the Fed's press release, reports or methodology about testing or measuring private credit or private debt in this year's test.",
      "The Fed's \u201cstress tests\u201d were created after the 2008 financial crisis as a way to gauge whether the nation's \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks could withstand another financial crisis like the once that happened nearly 20 years ago. The tests are effectively an academic exercise, where the Fed simulates a scenario in the global economy and measures what that scenario would do to bank balance sheets.",
      "The 22 banks that are tested are the biggest names in the business, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which hold hundreds of billions of dollars in assets and have wide-ranging businesses that touch every part of the U.S. and global economy.",
      "Under this year's hypothetical scenario, a major global recession would have caused a 30% decline in commercial real estate prices and a 33% decline in housing prices. The unemployment rate would rise to 10% and stock prices would fall 50%. In 2024, the hypothetical scenario was a 40% decline in commercial real estate prices, a 55% decline in stock prices and a 36% decline in housing prices.",
      "With their passing grades, the major banks will be allowed to issue dividends to shareholders and buy back shares of stock to return proceeds to investors. Those dividend plans will be announced next week.",

      "Smucker said the majority of its products \u2013 including its Uncrustables sandwiches \u2013 are already free of synthetic dyes. But some products still have them, including sugar-free jams and ice cream toppings.",
      "Smucker said some products from Hostess, which it acquired in 2023, also contain artificial colors. Twinkies are made with Red 40 and Yellow 5, for example, while Snoballs snack cakes are made with Red 40 Lake, a dye combined with aluminum to keep it from dissolving in water.",
      "Smucker joins a growing number of big food companies that have announced plans to eliminate artificial dyes. Earlier this week, Nestle and Conagra Brands \u2014 the parent company of Duncan Hines \u2014 both said they would phase out synthetic dyes. Kraft Heinz and General Mills made similar pledges last week.",

      "A California judge has ruled the state's bare-bones home insurance program's handling of smoke damage claims is unlawful, a decision that could have wide-ranging implications as insurers increasingly deal with the aftermath of wildfires.",
      "Home insurance broadly covers fire damage, but there is a growing dispute over what damage must be covered when flames don\u2019t torch the property. The decision Tuesday by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Stuart M. Rice is a victory for homeowners in a state where the risk of catastrophic wildfires has intensified alongside a brewing home insurance crisis.",
      "The specific case involved Jay Aliff, who sued in 2021 over the insurance payout for his house near Lake Tahoe, which was damaged in the November 2020 Mountain View fire. His lawsuit challenged the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, or the FAIR Plan, the state\u2019s high-risk insurance pool or the last-resort option for those dropped by private insurance companies.",
      "With high premiums and basic coverage, the FAIR Plan was designed as a temporary safety net until policyholders could find a more permanent option. Today, it has become the default option for many, with the number of residential policies reaching 550,000 in March, more than double from 2020, state data shows.",
      "Reports from other urban wildfires, in which building materials, appliances, cars and more burn at incredibly high temperatures, show increased levels of heavy metals including lead and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) such as benzene that are tied to negative health risks. But insurance companies haven\u2019t standardized testing for those contaminants.",
      "The FAIR Plan has been scrutinized for years over allegations of summarily denying smoke damage claims unless there\u2019s proof of permanent physical change, even though the California Department of Insurance has long determined that that threshold is illegal.",
      "Aliff's lawsuit claims that FAIR Plan at the time offered a fraction of the money he expected to cover the costs to remediate the damages, citing a partial denial letter that said the fire debris could be cleaned up \u2013- and therefore didn\u2019t qualify for coverage as a \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d to the home.",
      "\u201cThe things that burn are terrifying like lead, cyanide. It\u2019s not possible to get that out with Swiffer,\u201d said Aliff\u2019s attorney, Dylan Schaffer, referring to the brand of disposable mops.",
      "Schaffer, who is also the attorney in a number of other lawsuits against the FAIR Plan related to the smoke damage issue, said the new court ruling was a game-changer in California insurance law at a time when thousands of homeowners in the recent Palisades and Eaton wildfires are still fighting for coverage.",
      "\u201cIt is the most important decision in California insurance law in decades,\u201d Schaffer said. \u201cIt draws a line in the sand as it relates to where carriers can start carving out their liability and avoiding liability.\u201d",
      "The ruling said the way the FAIR Plan limits smoke damage coverage to its definition of \u201cdirect physical loss\u201d was a violation of the law, stating that \u201cthis language limits coverage reasonably expected by an insured in a manner which is not conspicuous, plain and clear.\u201d",
      "The judge also said it was unlawful that the FAIR Plan required smoke damage to be \u201cvisible to the unaided human eye\u201d or capable of being \u201cdetected by the unaided human nose of an average person\u201d rather than \"the subjective senses of (the insured) or by laboratory testing.\u201d",
      "\u201cBeing unable to resort to their own senses or laboratory tests, it is entirely unclear how an insured could determine whether a particular loss is covered or not,\u201d the court decision noted.",
      "FAIR Plan spokeswoman Hilary McLean said in a statement that the insurer has been working with the state insurance agency to update its policy language and has already eliminated the so-called sight and smell test.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to continue providing fair and reasonable coverage for wildfire-related losses while maintaining the financial integrity of the FAIR Plan for all policyholders,\" McLean said in a statement.",

      "The House version of the GOP's bill removed silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms considered the most dangerous, and in the process, would have eliminated a $200 tax. The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Under the National Firearms Act, potential buyers of the regulated weapons must also undergo a finger-print based background check. There is no deadline for such checks. The process is arguably more thorough than the name-based background check completed for other firearms purchases.",
      "Lawmakers said the silencers provision was deemed by the Senate parliamentarian to be in violation of the \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d which stipulates that the budget changes sought in the legislation cannot be \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the policy changes. The special rules are designed to deter provisions unrelated to spending or taxes from being included in the bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Republicans will jump at any opportunity to please the gun lobby by rolling back gun safety measures, but that kind of policy does not belong in a reconciliation bill,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.",
      "Gun rights groups complained about the $200 tax and how the background check process often takes weeks and even months for silencers and short-barreled weapons.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, said before the ruling that the proposed changes were aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argued that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane said.",
      "John Commerford, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, disagreed with the parliamentarian's ruling, noting that she was originally appointed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, we remain committed to working with our allies on Capitol Hill to end the unjust tax burden on these constitutionally-protected arms,\u201d Commerford said.",
      "Groups opposed to the measure included Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization co-founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords who was grievously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in her district.",
      "Emma Brown, the group's executive director said \u201cremoving safeguards on gun silencers would have made it easier for violent criminals to escape, putting both law enforcement and civilians at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\"What\u2019s more, removing safeguards on short barreled firearms would have only enabled more criminals to access these easily concealable weapons, which can be easily brought into large crowds,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The gun language had broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues.",
      "It is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items that were included to entice members to vote for the legislation and will have broad implications in the years to come.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key inflation gauge moved higher in May in the latest sign that prices remain stubbornly elevated while Americans cut back on their spending.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, the Commerce Department said Friday. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, an increase from 2.5% the previous month. Both figures are modestly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.",
      "At the same time, Americans cut back on spending for the first time since January, as overall spending fell 0.1%.",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Donald Trump\u2019s broad-based tariffsare still having only a modest effect on prices. The costs of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares, and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month\u2019s 0.1%.",
      "The weakness in spending in part likely reflects reduced purchases of cars and other manufactured goods after Americans stepped up their spending on those items this spring to get ahead of tariffs.",

      "It started off at 8.50 euros per hour, but the independent commission reviews its level regularly.

      "NEW YORK -- Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans who use the loans to buy clothing, furniture, concert tickets, and takeout.",
      "Scoring company FICO said Monday that it is rolling out a new model that factors the short-term loans into their consumer scores. A majority of lenders use FICO scores to determine a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness. Previously, the loans had been excluded, though Buy Now, Pay Later company Affirm began voluntarily reporting pay-in-four loans to Experian, a separate credit bureau, in April.",
      "The new FICO scores will be available beginning in the fall, as an option for lenders to increase visibility into consumers' repayment behavior, the company said. Still, not all Buy Now, Pay Later companies share their data with the credit bureaus, and not all lenders will opt in to using the new models, so widespread adoption could take time, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Typically, when using Buy Now, Pay Later loans, consumers pay for a given purchase in four installments over six weeks, in a model more similar to layaway than to a traditional credit card. The loans are marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or only a soft credit check.",
      "The main three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, haven't yet incorporated a standard way of including these new financial products in their reports, since they don't adhere to existing models of lending and repayment. FICO, the score of the Fair Isaac Corporation, uses data from the bureaus to calculate its own credit score, and is independently choosing to pilot a new score that takes the loans into account.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as safer alternatives to credit cards, while consumer advocates warn about \u201cloan stacking,\u201d in which consumers take on many loans at once across several companies. So far, there's been little visibility into this practice in the industry, and the opacity has led to warnings of \u201cphantom debt\" that could mask the health of the consumer.",
      "In a statement, FICO said that their new credit score model is accounting for the growing significance of the loans in the U.S. credit ecosystem.",
      "\u201cBuy Now, Pay Later loans are playing an increasingly important role in consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d said Julie May, vice president and general manager of business-to-business scores at FICO. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling lenders to more accurately evaluate credit readiness, especially for consumers whose first credit experience is through BNPL products.\"",
      "FICO said the new model will responsibly expand access to credit. Many users of BNPL loans are younger consumers and consumers who may not have good or lengthy credit histories. In a joint study with Affirm, FICO trained its new scores on a sample of more than 500,000 BNPL borrowers and found that consumers with five or more loans typically saw their scores increase or remain stable under the new model.",
      "For consumers who pay back their BNPL loans in a timely way, the new credit scoring model could help them improve their credit scores, increasing access to mortgages, car loans, and apartment rentals. Currently, the loans don't typically contribute directly to improved scores, though missed payments can hurt or ding a score.",
      "Since March, credit scores have declined steeply for millions, as student loan payments resume and many student borrowers find themselves unable to make regular payments on their federal student loans.",
      "Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said her main concern is that the integration of the loans into a score could have unexpected negative effects on people who are already credit-restrained.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about how integrating BNPL into credit scoring will work out,\u201d Chabrier said. \u201cFICO simulated the effect on credit scoring through a study. They saw that some users\u2019 scores increased. But if you factor in something that, last week, didn\u2019t affect your credit, and this week, it does, without having very much information about the modeling, it's a little hard to tell what the consequences will be.\u201d",
      "Chabrier cited research that\u2019s shown that many BNPL users have revolving credit card balances, lower credit scores, delinquencies, and existing debt. Women of color are also more likely to use the loans, she said.",

      "GE Appliances has announced a nearly half-billion-dollar project that will create 800 jobs and shift production of clothes washers from China to its manufacturing complex in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances announced a nearly half-billion-dollar project Thursday that it says will create 800 new jobs and shift production of clothes washers from China to its massive manufacturing complex in Kentucky.",
      "The $490 million investment positions the Kentucky home appliances company to rank as the biggest U.S. manufacturer of washing machines, it said.",
      "\u201cWe are bringing laundry production to our global headquarters in Louisville because manufacturing in the U.S. is fundamental to our \u2018zero-distance\u2019 business strategy to make appliances as close as possible to our customers and consumers,\u201d CEO Kevin Nolan said. \u201cThis decision is our most recent product reshoring and aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. He has slapped 10% tariffs on imports from most countries and put 30% levies on Chinese goods. GE Appliances says nearly all the steel used in its U.S. manufacturing for its appliances comes from American steelmakers.",
      "GE Appliances said the project will move production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers from China to the Bluegrass State. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's sprawling Louisville production complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said. Once the added production is in place, the total area devoted to clothes care production at the Louisville complex will equal 33 football fields, it said.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has criticized Trump's tariffs, hailed the company's deepening commitment to the state.",
      "\u201cToday's announcement brings more appliance manufacturing back to the United States and solidifies Kentucky and Louisville as the global headquarters of GE Appliances,\u201d the governor said.",
      "The redesigned factory will become its most advanced manufacturing plant for clothes washing production, the company said, featuring the latest in automation, robotics and material-handling technologies including automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots.",
      "The new manufacturing lines will open in 2027, the company said.",
      "Next door at the complex's Building 1, the company produces top load washers and front load dryers.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but lacks overall production capacity to make all of its products at its U.S. plants. So it contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and the investment announced Thursday is another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "\u201cManufacturing in Louisville puts production closer to our designers, engineers and consumers so that together we can create our most innovative laundry platforms,\u201d said Lee Lagomarcino, vice president of clothes care at GE Appliances.",
      "The $490 million infusion into Appliance Park is the latest round of investments in recent years as part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. It builds on the company's previous investments of $3.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing in the past decade, with more than one-third of the amount going to Appliance Park.",
      "Appliance Park in Louisville employs about 8,000 workers and is home to five plants that produce washers, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators as well as parts and components. GE Appliances also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill doesn't adhere to procedural rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill does not adhere to the chamber's procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow as Republicans rush to finish the package this week.",
      "Guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and Republican leaders are now forced to consider difficult options. Republicans were counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks, their top priority. Additionally, the parliamentarian, who is the Senate's chief arbiter of its often complicated rules, advised against various GOP provisions barring certain immigrants from health care programs.",
      "Republicans scrambled Thursday to respond, with some calling for challenging, or ever firing, the nonpartisan parliamentarian, who has been on the job since 2012. GOP leaders dismissed those views and instead worked to revise the various proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have contingency plans,\u201d said Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.",
      "Friday's expected votes appeared to be slipping, but Thune insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re plowing forward.\u201d",
      "But Democrats, who are unified against the package as a tax giveaway for the wealthy at the expense of American safety net programs, said the procedural decisions would devastate the GOP package.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican proposals would have meant $250 billion less for the health care program, \u201cmassive Medicaid cuts that hurt kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.\u201d",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans race toward a weekend session to pass the bill and send it back to the House for another vote before Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline. Trump hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP lawmakers in the East Room at the White House, joined by truck drivers, firefighters, tipped workers, ranchers and others that the administration says will benefit from the bill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have grandstanders,\u201d Trump said of the GOP holdouts.",
      "Trump said there are \u201chundreds of things\u201d in the emerging package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money to carry out his mass deportation plans. \u201cIt's so good.\u201d",
      "At its core, the big bill, which has passed the House and is now being revised in the Senate, includes $3.8 trillion in tax breaks that had been approved during Trump's first term but will expire in December, imposing a tax hike if Congress fails to act. To help offset lost revenues, Republicans are relying on steep cuts to health care and food stamps, and imposing new fees on immigrants.",
      "GOP leaders were already struggling to rally support for Medicaid changes that some senators said went too far and would have left millions without coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said more than 10.9 million more people would not have health care under the House-passed bill; Senate Republicans were proposing deeper cuts.",
      "After the parliamentarian advised against the Medicaid provider tax change, Republicans said they would try to revise the provision to make it acceptable, perhaps by extending the start date of any changes. They are rushing to come up with similar adjustments to other proposals that have run into violations, including one to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "It's all delaying action on the bill, but Republican leaders have little choice. They are counting on the health care restrictions to save billions of dollars and offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, rejected calls to fire the parliamentarian, and said in a statement he was working with the office to \u201cfind a pathway forward.\u201d",
      "States impose the so-called provider tax on hospitals and other entities as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics say the system is a type of \u201claundering,\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the tax, while the Senate would cut the tax that some states are allowed to impose.",
      "Several GOP senators have opposed cutting the Medicaid provider tax, saying it would hurt rural hospitals that depend on the money. Hospital organizations have warned that it could lead to hospital closures.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., among those fighting the change, said he had spoken to Trump late Wednesday and the president told him to revert to the earlier proposal from the House.",
      "\u201cI think it just confirms that we weren\u2019t ready for a vote yet,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who also had raised concerns about the provider tax cuts.",
      "More than 80 million people in the United States use the Medicaid program, alongside the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to scale Medicaid back to what they say is its original mission, providing care mainly to women and children, rather than a much larger group of people.",
      "To help defray lost revenues to the hospitals, one plan Republicans had been considering would have created a rural hospital fund with $15 billion as backup. Some GOP senators said that was too much; others, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, wanted at least $100 billion.",
      "The parliamentarian has worked around the clock to assess the legislation and ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It essentially bars policy matters in budget reconciliation bills.",
      "If leaders moved ahead without altering the provisions, the measures could be challenged, requiring a 60-vote threshold to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate divided 53-47 and with Democrats unified against Trump's bill.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty frustrating,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who wants even steeper reductions.",
      "Overnight Wednesday the parliamentarian advised against GOP student loan repayment plans, and Thursday the parliamentarian cited those that would have blocked access to Medicaid and other health care programs from immigrants who are not citizens. Earlier, plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also found to violate the rules.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said there's no desire to challenge the parliamentarian's advice. \u201cIt's the institutional integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I'm convinced 100% she's wrong.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republicans lost another potential revenue source Thursday after agreeing to a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to remove the so-called revenge tax provision, section 899, that would have allowed the government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and investors from certain countries. Bessent said he has reached a separate agreement with such countries.",

      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit planet-warming carbon dioxide are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.",
      "The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.",
      "But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.",
      "Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped \u2014 usually through a pipeline \u2014 to a location where it\u2019s injected deep underground for long-term storage.",
      "Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.",
      "Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.",
      "The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves \u2014 meaning it's not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.",
      "Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, \u201cin practice, that has never happened,\u201d said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s Oil & Gas Watch.",
      "That's because it's difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it's emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.",
      "Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it's less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.",
      "A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.",
      "About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.",
      "It's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.",
      "The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil\u2019s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.",
      "Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a substitution for renewables ... it\u2019s just a complementary technology,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.\u201d",
      "Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.",
      "They remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

      "Applications for unemployment aid are a proxy for layoffs, and so the decline is evidence that businesses are mostly holding onto their employees. Yet separate data suggests hiring also remains cool, in what economists are referring to as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d job market.",
      "The unemployment rate remains low, though there are signs that the economy is slowing. So far this year, employers have added a solid but unspectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year. Most of the hiring has been concentrated in a few industries, specifically health care, restaurants and hotels, and government. Layoffs have mostly remained low, but hiring has also been weak.",
      "Yet for many job-seekers, the sluggish creation of new jobs has been a challenge. Recent college graduates are facing the toughest job market in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for grads aged 22 to 27 is now higher than the overall jobless rate, and the gap between the two is the widest it has been in more than 30 years.",
      "The difficulty many of the unemployed are having in finding work can be seen in the number of people continuing to claim unemployment aid, which rose 37,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 14. That is the most since November 2021.",
      "Separately, the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a worse showing than its previous estimate of a 0.2% decline. A flood of imports swamped the economy as companies rushed to bring in foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect.",

The Commerce Department previously estimated that the economy fell 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast no change in the department's third and final estimate.",

Imports expanded 37.9%, fastest since 2020, and pushed GDP down by nearly 4.7 percentage points.",

    "summary": "The European Union is reassessing its ties with China strained relations with the United States",
    "story": [
      "The European Union is reassessing its ties with China strained relations with the United States",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Jilted, betrayed, dumped, or defiant. It's hard to describe the European Union after relentless attacks from its once-dependable ally, the United States. The threat from Donald Trump's second administration against Greenland, its sweeping tariff plans and courtship of Moscow have firmed up some European leaders\u2019 vows to reduce their reliance on America.",
      "That has not gone unnoticed in another global power. China hopes for a Europe detached from the U.S. and is sensing an opportunity now to divide the West. For the past several years, the EU moved in lockstep with Washington to levy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and sanction Chinese officials accused of rights violations.",
      "Now, locked in a trade war with Washington that may be prolonged, Beijing sees the 27-nation bloc as a desirable partner in blunting the impact from Trump\u2019s tariffs and to maintain its strong global position.",
      "But for EU leaders, meeting Thursday in Brussels to discuss China among a host of regional and global issues, managing ties with Beijing is no easy matter.",
      "An upcoming summit in China in July to mark 50 years of ties might offer the first hint of new consensus between these two global behemoths.",
      "The EU-China economic ties are hefty: bilateral trade is estimated at 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) per day.",
      "China is the EU\u2019s second largest trading partner in goods, after the United States. Both China and the EU believe it is in their interest to keep their trade ties stable for the sake of the global economy, and they share certain climate goals.",
      "Like the U.S., Europe runs a massive trade deficit with China: around 300 billion euros last year. It relies heavily on China for critical minerals, which are also used to make magnets used in cars and appliances. As European companies are seeing declining profitability in China, Brussels is hoping Beijing will follow through on recent pledges, like one announced Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce, to ease restrictions on foreign business ventures.",
      "\u201cWhile other opened their market, China focused undercutting intellectual property protections, massive subsidies with the aim to dominate global manufacturing and supply chains,\u201d said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the G7 meeting in Canada. \u201cThis is not market competition \u2013 it is distortion with intent.\"",
      "Now, Europe, already fretting over the trade deficit, worries that Trump's tariffs could divert even more Chinese goods to Europe, destabilizing markets across the continent.",
      "Such vulnerabilities could strengthen Beijing's negotiating position, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, a China analyst with the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.",
      "\u201cChina has built so many strategic dependencies that the EU is trapped in an asymmetric relationship,\u201d she said, and Beijing could leverage them to \u201cget a deal in July\" at the summit.",
      "Analysts don\u2019t expect a grand bargain at the summit, but China will likely demand the EU lift tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles or even reopen the bilateral trade treaty, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. Either or both would send a powerful signal to Washington.",
      "But China's main goal is ensuring the EU remains an accessible and affluent market for goods that might not reach the U.S. because of Trump\u2019s tariff blitzkrieg. Despite a truce in the trade war, Chinese businesses are widening their global reach to be less dependent on the U.S.",
      "Regardless of any deal, the summit itself will be the message, said Noah Barkin, an analyst of Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank. For the EU, the main goal would be for von der Leyen to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said.",
      "Whereas she was \u201ctreated rather shabbily\u201d on a 2023 trip to Beijing, Barkin said the Chinese this time will probably \u201croll out the red carpet,\" keen to see \u201cpictures of Chinese and European leaders walking through gardens and sending a message of unity.\u201d",
      "Sun Chenghao, head of the U.S.-EU program at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy, expressed hope \u201cthat the future of China-Europe relations can be more independent on both sides.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Europe, that would mean shaping its China policy based on its own interests, rather than simply taking sides,\u201d Sun told the German Marshall Fund in a podcast. \u201cAnd for China, this means building a more independent and nuanced approach to Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is precisely because most European decision-makers realize the necessity of strategic autonomy that they have made it clear that they must strengthen cooperation with China,\" said Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news site.",
      "\"Even if China and Europe have differences on the Ukraine issue, there is still room for expanding cooperation in areas beyond the differences.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s deepening ties with its historic allies in Europe like Hungary and Greece stand alongside fears across the continent about its human rights record, espionage, trade policies, military buildup and support for Russia.",
      "European police arrested employees of the Chinese tech giant Huawei during an ongoing bribery investigation in Brussels. Czech intelligence services have claimed Beijing directed cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. And the EU\u2019s criticisms of China\u2019s human rights violations remain unabated.",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further disaffected Europe from China. Despite Beijing\u2019s claims of neutrality, Europe largely sees China as complicit in, if not covertly supporting Russia\u2019s war machine.",
      "The EU recently cancelled a high-level economic and trade dialogue with China, due to a lack of progress on trade disputes. It also has moved to restrict Chinese participation in EU medical devices procurement.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called out Spain for its courtship of China, warning that countries seeking to get closer to China would be \u201ccutting their own throat\u201d because Chinese factories will be looking to dump goods that they can\u2019t ship to the U.S.",
      "By decoupling their positions on China, analysts say both Brussels and Washington have weaker hands dealing with Beijing. And that might hurt the U.S., which has vowed to prevail over China and retain its global dominance but, as many believe, needs help from its allies and partners.",
      "\u201cIf we could just get Japan and the EU and the U.S. together on any issue, ... we could outweigh the Chinese at the negotiating table,\u201d said Nick Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China in the Biden administration. \u201cPresident Trump, I think, because of his inattention to our allies and maybe even worse, his sometimes just acrimonious behaviors towards allies, has given away that leverage.\u201d",
      "Joerg Wuttke, former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China and now a partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington, argued that the fundamentals underlining EU-China relations have not changed as long as China does not take genuine steps to open its market and that the EU remains \u201cgeared towards\u201d the U.S., though he described Washington as a \u201cmajor backdrop noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not allies. We are trading partners,\u201d Wuttke said of EU and China. \u201cAnd, so from my point of view is, what is there to worry for the United States?\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Coco Gauff is a tennis star who is seeded No. 2 at Wimbledon and already owns two Grand Slam titles at age 21",
      "LONDON -- To be clear, Coco Gauff didn't bring up the word \u201cstar\u201d during a recent interview with The Associated Press; the reporter did. So as Gauff began to answer a question about balancing her life as a professional athlete with her off-court interests, she caught herself repeating that term.",
      "\u201cI definitely didn\u2019t know how it would look like,\u201d she began with a smile, \u201cbefore I got to be, I guess, a star \u2014 feels weird to call myself that \u2014 but I definitely did want to expand outside of tennis. Always. Since I was young.\u201d",
      "She still is young, by just about any measure, and she is a really good tennis player \u2014 Gauff owns the Grand Slam titles and No. 2 ranking to prove it as she heads into Wimbledon, which begins Monday \u2014 but the 21-year-old American is also more than that.",
      "Someone unafraid to express her opinions about societal issues. Someone who connects with fans via social media. Someone who is the highest-paid female athlete in any sport, topping $30 million last year, according to Sportico.com, with less than a third of that from prize money and most via deals with companies such as UPS, New Balance, Rolex and Barilla. Someone who recently launched her own management firm.",
      "And someone who wants to succeed in the business world long after she no longer swings a racket on tour.",
      "\u201cIt's definitely something that I want to start to step up for post-career. Kind of start building that process, which is why I wanted to do it early. Because I didn\u2019t want to feel like I was playing catch-up at the end of my career,\u201d said Gauff, who will face Dayana Yastremska in the first round at the All England Club on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cOn the business side of things, it doesn\u2019t come as natural as tennis feels. I\u2019m still learning, and I have a lot to learn about,\" Gauff said. \"I\u2019ve debated different things and what paths I wanted to take when it came to just stimulating my brain outside of the court, because I always knew that once I finished high school that I needed to put my brain into something else.\u201d",
      "In a campaign announced this week by UPS, which first partnered with Gauff in 2023 before she won that year's U.S. Open, she connects with business coach Emma Grede \u2014 known for working with Kim Kardashian on Skims, and with Khloe Kardashian on Good American \u2014 to offer mentoring to three small-business owners.",
      "\u201cCoco plays a key role in helping us connect with those younger Gen-Z business owners \u2014 emerging or younger entrepreneurs,\u201d Betsy Wilson, VP of digital marketing and brand activation at UPS, said in a phone interview. \u201cObviously, she\u2019s very relevant in social media and in culture, and working with Coco helps us really connect with that younger group.\u201d",
      "While Grede helped the entrepreneurs, Gauff also got the opportunity to pick up tips.",
      "\u201cIt's really cool to learn from someone like her,\u201d Gauff said. \u201cWhenever I feel like I\u2019m ready to make that leap, I can definitely reach out to her for advice and things like that. ... This will help me right now and definitely in the long term.\u201d",

      "Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation that provides public funding to renovate Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks",
      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cWithout the Diamondbacks in Chase Field, there wouldn't be the tax revenue that's being used,\u201d said Hobbs spokesperson Christian Slater, who confirmed that the governor signed the bill Friday.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, team president Derrick Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

      "Added Ricky Stenhouse, who is 24th in the points race, of the new tournament: \u201cIt's cool. I think after this weekend you'll have a little better idea of what you have. Our main goal in Atlanta is winning and getting into the playoffs.\u201d",
      "Team Penske claimed four of the top five qualifying positions and Ford claimed all of the top five spots.",
      "Logano was first at 178.960 mph, tying Josh Berry, who drives for Wood Brothers but has a technical alliance with Team Penske. Ryan Blaney qualified third and Austin Cindric was one spot back for Team Penske, while Ryan Preece, in another Ford for RFK Racing, was fifth.",
      "\u201cIt definitely helps at the start for sure,\u201d Logano said. \u201cBeing at the front and controlling the race is the thing for sure.\u201d",
      "Briscoe is facing No. 31 seed Noah Gragson in the first bracket. He says it's a difficult matchup, in part because \u201che\u2019s actually probably my best friend on the circuit \u2026 and my son\u2019s favorite driver.\u201d",
      "Briscoe said his 3-year-old son, Brooks, thinks of Gragson \u201clike that uncle that just you take your kid to, and he has Pop-Tarts and ice cream and everything else when he\u2019s with them.\u201d",
      "Added Briscoe: \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll win. If not I\u2019ll never here the end of it from Noah or my son.\u201d",
      "Briscoe posted a photo on his X account of his son's bracket. The photo shows the smiling Brooks holding a bracket with his father's No. 19 winning every round of the tournament.",
      "Chase Elliott has a special paint scheme on his No. 9 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet that was designed by 11-year-old cancer patient Rhealynn Mills. Elliott chose Mills' design to highlight his foundation's efforts to raise money for Children\u2019s Healthcare of Atlanta.",
      "Elliott said the \u201cDesign to Drive\u201d program has raised $500,000 for the children's hospital.",
      "\u201cThe only bad thing is I feel like we've crashed every time we've done it,\u201d Elliott said, adding his sponsor, NAPA Auto Parts, deserved credit \u201cfor giving up the car\u201d so the paint scheme could instead feature Mills' design.",
      "EchoPark Speedway is the new name for the track that was still known as Atlanta Motor Speedway in February when Christopher Bell won while leading only the final lap in overtime. It's the home track for Elliott, from Dawsonville, Georgia, and he acknowledged seeing the name change and the new green paint \u201cwas different for me. I think it's fine.\u201d",
      "Ryan Blaney is the favorite (+800) to win the race, per BetMGM Sportsbook. Joey Logano and Austin Cindric, each at +1000, were next.",

      "The West Indies was set a stressful 301 target to win on a tricky pitch and folded in 33.4 overs.",
      "The chief destroyer was seamer Josh Hazlewood with 5-43 from 12 overs.",
      "The West Indies collapsed to 86-8 inside 27 overs but the Australians didn't mop up the last resistance until the day's last over in an extra 75 minutes.",
      "Despite the inevitable, allrounder Justin Greaves, 38 not out, and No. 10 batter Shamar Joseph, a career-best 44 with four sixes, went for broke in a team-best ninth-wicket stand of 55 runs.",
      "Australia started the day in some bother at 92-4 in its second innings, but half-centuries from Travis Head, Beau Webster and Alex Carey hoisted them to an impressive 310 all out and a 300-run lead.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to get 200 but felt lot more comfortable (with 300),\u201d captain Pat Cummins said. \u201cWe're lucky to have Josh, he presents a good seam and hits good areas. He bowled beautifully.\u201d",
      "West Indies' attempt at its eighth highest successful run chase and highest in eight years was in trouble from the outset.",
      "Mitchell Starc claimed opening batter Kraigg Brathwaite in the first over, caught at backward square by a diving Sam Konstas.",
      "\u201cWe lost our most experienced batsman in the first over and never got a foot back in the game,\u201d West Indies captain Roston Chase said. \u201cThe result was heartbreaking. We did well to get a (10-run first-innings) lead but couldn't put a batting innings together.\u201d",

      "Australia, starting on 92-4 and a lead of 82, amassed a bonus 310 total.",
      "After taking cover late Thursday, Head came out firing in the morning but should have gone on 21 and it be 107-5. Greaves spilled the catch at second slip off the bowling of Alzarri Joseph. It was West Indies' seventh dropped catch in the match.",
      "Head shook it off and drove Alzarri Joseph, Jayden Seales, Warrican and Greaves to the ropes. From 13 off 37 balls overnight, Head reached his 50 in 77 balls. The match had only two half-centuries at that stage, and Head had both.",

      "He and Webster rattled off the only century partnership of the game, too. Head was the only wicket to fall in the morning, to a low nip-backer by Shamar Joseph. Head had eight boundaries in his 61 off 95 balls.",
      "Straight after lunch, Webster got his third half-century in his fifth test from 100 deliveries. He was also out to Shamar Joseph, edging behind, which was picked up on review. He also had eight boundaries.",

      "A tech industry trade group has sued Arkansas over two new law placing limits on content on social media platforms",
      "LITTLE ROCK, Ark. -- A tech industry trade group sued Arkansas Friday over two new laws that would place limits on content on social media platforms and would allow parents of children who killed themselves to sue over content on the platforms.",
      "The lawsuit by NetChoice filed in federal court in Fayetteville, Arkansas, comes months after a federal judge struck down a state law requiring parental consent before minors can create new social media accounts. The new laws were signed by Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders earlier this year.",
      "\u201cDespite the overwhelming consensus that laws like the Social Media Safety Act are unconstitutional, Arkansas elected to respond to this Court\u2019s decision not by repealing the provisions that it held unconstitutional but by instead doubling down on its overreach,\u201d NetChoice said in its lawsuit.",
      "Arkansas is among several states that have been enacting restrictions on social media, prompted by concerns about the impact on children's mental health. NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "LONDON -- Apple has revamped its app store policies in the European Union with hopes of fending off escalating fines under the 27-nation bloc's digital competition regulations.",
      "It's a last-minute bid by the iPhone maker to avoid further charges following a 500 million euro ($585 million) penalty in April. The bloc's executive Commission punished Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store, and gave it a 60-day deadline, which expired Thursday, to avoid additional, periodic fines.",
      "The changes made by Apple will make it easier for app makers to point users to better deals on digital products and options to pay for them outside of Apple's own App Store, including other websites, apps or alternative app stores.",
      "The California company is also rolling out a two-tier system of fees to accommodate app developers that want to use alternative payments.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\" Apple said in a statement. \"We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "The commission noted Apple\u2019s announcement and \u201cwill now assess these new business terms for DMA compliance,\u201d referring to the EU\u2019s Digital Markets Act. The rulebook was designed to rein in the power of big tech companies under threat of hefty fines worth up to 10% of a company's global annual revenue.",
      "Among the DMA\u2019s provisions are requirements that developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options, and direct them to those offers.",
      "Apple's restrictions preventing developers from steering users to outside payment channels had been fiercely opposed by some companies. It's the reason, for example, Spotify removed the in-app payment option to avoid having to pay a commission of up to 30% on digital subscriptions bought through iOS.",

      "A video of Kennedy's speech was shown to participants at a Gavi meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, where the vaccines group was hoping to raise at least $9 billion for the next five years.",

      "Kennedy said Gavi continues to make \u201cquestionable recommendations,\u201d like advising pregnant women to get immunized against COVID-19 and funding the roll-out of a vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis in poorer countries.",
      "WHO and other health authorities have recommended pregnant women get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying they are at higher risk of severe disease.",
      "Kennedy said he has seen research that concluded that young girls vaccinated against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis were more likely to die from all other causes than children who weren\u2019t immunized.",
      "Some observational studies have shown that vaccinated girls do have a higher death rate compared to unvaccinated children, but there is no evidence the deaths are caused by the vaccine.",

      "A federal judge on Wednesday sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge sided with Facebook parent Meta Platforms in dismissing a copyright infringement lawsuit from a group of authors who accused the company of stealing their works to train its artificial intelligence technology.",
      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",

      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",

      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",
      "Calls to bolster America's digital defense come as the Trump administration has moved to slash some cybersecurity programs as part of its effort to shrink the size of government.",
      "CISA has placed staffers who worked on election security on leave and cut millions of dollars in funding for cybersecurity programs for local and state elections.",
      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",
      "There is a new arms race when it comes to cyberwar, Bellini said, and it's a contest America can't afford to lose.",
      "\u201cIt's Wile E. Coyote vs. the Road Runner,\u201d Bellini said. \"It will go back and forth, and it will never end.\u201d",

      "DENVER -- It is often said music is the universal language of humanity. Now a 12-year-old Houston boy is putting that to the test among an unlikely audience \u2014 man's best friend.",
      "Yuvi Agarwal started playing keyboard when he was 4 and several years ago noticed his playing soothed his family's restless golden doodle, Bozo. He grew curious if it also could help stressed homeless animals.",
      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",
      "\u201cThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",

      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",
      "With 18 different robotaxi partnerships in place around the world, Uber says it is on pace to make about 1.5 million annual driverless trips that either transport passengers or deliver food.",

      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",

      "The administration can start planning how it will end birthright citizenship.",
      "The Supreme Court on Friday handed down a highly-anticipated ruling involving President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive order to effectively end birthright citizenship.",
      "But many questions remain about how such an order would be carried out on a practical level.",
      "And while the court's conservative majority limited nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges against the order, the court did not rule on whether the order itself is constitutional.",
      "Still, the decision could lead to a radical reshaping of a legal right to citizenship that's been long guaranteed by the 14th Amendment -- at least in the short term.",
      "Effective immediately, the administration can begin planning for how it would implement an end to birthright citizenship.",
      "Trump's order itself has a 30-day grace period before taking effect, meaning right now there is no change to birthright citizenship and children born everywhere in the country are still U.S. citizens.",
      "Regulations will need to be drafted and specifics of such an order still need to be addressed: for example, will every pregnant woman in America now need to go to the hospital with a passport or birth certificate?",
      "The White House on Friday had no clear answers when pressed for specifics.",
      "Federal district courts in Maryland, Massachusetts and New Hampshire will soon have to revisit nationwide injunctions issued there in light of the court's decision and tailor or narrow them to apply only to the plaintiffs who brought these cases.",
      "The plaintiffs were 22 states, immigrant advocacy groups and a number of pregnant noncitizen women.",
      "Challengers to Trump's executive order will continue to litigate the order on the merits. No court has directly considered the constitutionality of the executive order, though three lower courts have said it would appear to plainly violate the 14th Amendment and there are three longstanding Supreme Court precedents unambiguously upholding birthright citizenship.",
      "But for the remaining 28 states that have not sued, Trump's attempts to end birthright citizenship could go into effect in as soon as 30 days.",
      "Challengers can and will also fight broad implementation in other ways as it moves forward.",
      "On Friday, one group filed a class action lawsuit seeking broad protection of all noncitizen pregnant women, even those who are not plaintiffs.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh indicated plaintiffs might also be able to challenge the administration's citizenship regulations, once issued, under the Administrative Procedures Act.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi, though, struggled on Friday to address how exactly administration is planning to implement Trump's order.",
      "Asked who would be tasked with vetting citizenship (for example, whether it would be nurses or doctors as babies are being born) Bondi only responded: \"This is all pending litigation.\"",
      "Another reporter asked Bondi, \"If you have an undocumented baby, would that baby then be an enforcement priority?\"",
      "\"The violent criminals in our country are the priority,\" Bondi deflected.",
      "What's next for nationwide injunctions?",
      "More broadly, the administration will likely seek to roll back nationwide injunctions blocking Trump policies in other cases.",
      "Those hearings and decisions will play out in the coming weeks.",
      "\"These injunctions have blocked our policies from tariffs to military readiness to immigration to foreign affairs, fraud, abuse and many other issues,\" Bondi said on Friday. \"The judges have tried to seize the executive branch's power and they cannot do that. No longer.\"",
      "President Trump said similarly as he celebrated the ruling.",
      "\"So, thanks to this decision, we can now promptly filed to proceed with these numerous policies and those that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis, including birthright citizenship, ending sanctuary city funding, suspending refugee resettlement, freezing unnecessary funding, stopping federal taxpayers from paying for transgender surgeries and numerous other priorities of the American people,\" the president said.",

    "story": [
      "The court voted 6-3 in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled in favor of parents seeking to opt their children out of public school instruction that conflicts with sincerely held religious beliefs.",
      "The case, brought by a group of Christian, Muslim and Jewish parents from Montgomery County, Maryland, sought a guaranteed exemption from the classroom reading of storybooks with LGBTQ themes, including same-sex marriage and exploration of gender identity.",
      "Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson cast the dissenting votes in the 6-3 decision.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito, writing for the court, said in the decision that refusing to allow parents to opt-out their kids from instruction that \"poses a very real threat of undermining their religious beliefs and practices\" violates the First Amendment protections for religious exercise.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education's \"introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks, along with its decision to withhold opt outs, places an unconstitutional burden on the parents' rights to the free exercise of their religion,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The court found that the parents are also likely to succeed in their lawsuit over free-exercise claims, and have shown they are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuit proceeds.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor accused the court of inventing a \"constitutional right to avoid exposure to subtle themes contrary to the religious principles that parents wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "She also reproduced in full one of the books at the heart of the dispute -- \"Uncle Bobby's Wedding,\" an illustrated children's book about a gay couple and their niece -- in the appendix of her dissent. Alito accused the book of advancing a \"specific, if subtle, message\" about marriage -- that two people, regardless of their sex, can get married so long as they love each other -- that is \"contrary to the religious principles that the parents in this case wish to instill in their children.\"",
      "\"The majority's myopic attempt to resolve a major constitutional question through close textual analysis of Uncle Bobby's Wedding also reveals its failure to accept and account for a fundamental truth: LGBTQ people exist. They are part of virtually every community and workplace of any appreciable size,\" Sotomayor wrote in her dissent while blasting Alito for his interpretation of the book. \"Eliminating books depicting LGBTQ individuals as happily accepted by their families will not eliminate student exposure to that concept. Nor does the Free Exercise Clause require the government to alter its programs to insulate students from that 'message.'\"",
      "In 2022, after introducing several LGBTQ-themed books into its language arts curriculum, the Montgomery County school board allowed parents to opt out if the content was deemed objectionable as a matter of faith. One year later, officials reversed course and said the opt-out program had become unwieldy and ran counter to values of inclusion.",
      "The parents alleged that use of the books in an elementary school curriculum -- without an opportunity to be excused -- amounts to government-led indoctrination regarding sensitive matters of sexuality. The school board insisted the books merely expose kids to diverse viewpoints and ideas.",
      "Pending the completion of the legal challenge, the school board \"should be ordered to notify them in advance whenever one of the books in question or any other similar book is to be used in any way and to allow them to have their children excused from that instruction,\" Alito wrote.",
      "The Supreme Court's conservative majority signaled during oral arguments in April that it was poised to establish a right of parents to opt out for sensitive subjects, saying it should be common sense.",
      "Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty who argued the case on behalf of the parents seeking the opt-out, called the ruling an \"historic victory for parental rights in Maryland and across America.\"",
      "\"Kids shouldn't be forced into conversations about drag queens, pride parades, or gender transitions without their parents' permission,\" Baxter said in a statement. \"Today, the Court restored common sense and made clear that parents -- not government -- have the final say in how their children are raised.\"",
      "An attorney representing the authors of some of the books involved in the case called the ruling \"a deeply disappointing blow to the right to read under the First Amendment.\"",
      "\"It is a fundamental betrayal of public schools' duty to prepare students to live in a diverse and pluralistic society,\" attorney Elly Brinkley, with U.S. Free Expression Programs, said in a statement. \"By allowing parents to pull their children out of classrooms when they object to particular content, the justices are laying the foundation for a new frontier in the assault on books of all kinds in schools.\"",
      "Brinkley said opt-outs for religious objections \"will chill what is taught in schools and usher in a more narrow orthodoxy as fear of offending any ideology or sensibility takes hold.\"",
      "President Donald Trump called the ruling a \"tremendous victory for parents\" during a White House press briefing Friday.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, during the briefing, thanked the Supreme Court for the decision, saying that restoring parents' rights to decide their child's education \"seems like a basic idea, but it took the Supreme Court to set the record straight.\"",
      "\"Now that ruling allows parents to opt out of dangerous trans ideology and make the decisions for their children that they believe is correct,\" Blanche said.",

      "While Trump celebrated the 6-3 court decision as a \"monumental win,\" the justices did not weigh in on whether his executive order is constitutional and allowed legal challenges to continue.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi acknowledged the justices will rule on the merits of Trump's Day 1 order during their next term, which starts in October.",
      "Trump and Bondi, though, praised the court's conservative majority for limiting a federal judge's power to block a president's policy nationwide. Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued only the Supreme Court can provide such universal relief.",
      "Nationwide injunctions have been at the center of the administration's monthslong standoff with the judiciary, as several of Trump's actions -- from his immigration crackdown to efforts to freeze federal funding -- have been halted by district court judges.",
      "\"I was elected on a historic mandate,\" Trump said from the podium. \"In recent months we've seen a handful of radical left judges effectively try to overrule the rightful powers of the president to stop the American people from getting the policies that they've voted for in record numbers. It was a grave threat to democracy.\"",
      "Trump specifically thanked Justice Barrett, who authored the opinion. Barrett has drawn some ire from conservatives for staking out independent ground and at times breaking with Trump, who appointed her to the bench.",
      "Asked about the conservative criticism of Barrett, Trump responded: \"I don't know about that. I just have great respect for her. I always have. And her decision was brilliantly written today.\"",
      "Trump also continued to make the case for his Day 1 executive order that would deny citizenship to children born on U.S. soil to unlawful immigrants or those on a temporary immigrant status. District court judges, so far, have said such a move would appear plainly contrary to the text of the 14th Amendment and legal precedent.",
      "The administration's claimed in court proceedings birthright citizenship creates a strong incentive for illegal immigration.",
      "\"They used birthright citizenship, some of the worst people, some of the cartels, to get people into our country,\" Trump said on Friday.",
      "Several Democrats, however, quickly spoke out against the court's ruling.",
      "Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, called it a \"green light\" for Trump to \"unravel the foundations of American democracy.\"",
      "\"The Supreme Court\u2019s decision to limit courts of their long-held authority to block illegal executive actions is an unprecedented and terrifying step toward authoritarianism, a grave danger to our democracy, and a predictable move from this extremist MAGA court,\" he wrote on X. \"By weakening the power of district courts to check the presidency, the Court is not defending the Constitution -- it\u2019s defacing it.\"",
      "\"His plan to end birthright citizenship is blatantly unconstitutional, but instead of stopping it in its tracks, the Court has instead ducked the question and bowed to an out-of-control Executive Branch,\" Schumer added.",

Because I will not be complicit in so grave an attack on our system of law, I dissent.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the Trump administration of \"gamesmanship\" and said with this ruling the Supreme Court's majority \"plays along.\"",
      "\"Every conceivable source of law confirms, birthright citizenship is the law of the land,\" she wrote in dissent.",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to underscore, in his view, the narrowness of the decision, insisting that class-action claims are still available and that the Supreme Court itself can and likely will review lower courts along the way with respect to scope of relief from an alleged illegal government policy.",

      "\"The statute advances the State's important interest in shielding children from sexually explicit content.

      "\"Many reasonable people, after all, view the speech at issue here as ugly and harmful for any audience. But the First Amendment protects those sexually explicit materials, for every adult.

      "Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback",
      "WASHINGTON -- Republican efforts to loosen regulations on gun silencers and short-barreled rifles and shotguns have been dealt a big setback with the Senate parliamentarian advising that the proposal would need to clear a 60-vote threshold if included in their big tax and immigration bill.",
      "Gun rights groups had been lobbying aggressively for the measure, which would essentially treat silencers and the short-barreled firearms like long guns. Gun-control groups celebrated the parliamentarian's ruling, saying the items have been regulated for nearly 100 years for good reason \u2014 they are a threat to first responders and communities.",
      "The House version of the GOP's bill removed silencers \u2014 called \u201csuppressors\u201d by the gun industry \u2014 from a 1930s law that regulates firearms considered the most dangerous, and in the process, would have eliminated a $200 tax. The Senate kept the provision on silencers in its version of the bill and expanded upon it, adding short-barreled, or sawed-off, rifles and shotguns.",
      "Under the National Firearms Act, potential buyers of the regulated weapons must also undergo a finger-print based background check. There is no deadline for such checks. The process is arguably more thorough than the name-based background check completed for other firearms purchases.",
      "Lawmakers said the silencers provision was deemed by the Senate parliamentarian to be in violation of the \u201cByrd Rule,\u201d which stipulates that the budget changes sought in the legislation cannot be \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the policy changes. The special rules are designed to deter provisions unrelated to spending or taxes from being included in the bill.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s no surprise that Republicans will jump at any opportunity to please the gun lobby by rolling back gun safety measures, but that kind of policy does not belong in a reconciliation bill,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.",
      "Gun rights groups complained about the $200 tax and how the background check process often takes weeks and even months for silencers and short-barreled weapons.",
      "Larry Keane of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, who supports the legislation, said before the ruling that the proposed changes were aimed at helping target shooters and hunters protect their hearing. He argued that the use of silencers in violent crimes is rare. \u201cAll it\u2019s ever intended to do is to reduce the report of the firearm to hearing safe levels,\u201d Keane said.",
      "John Commerford, executive director of the National Rifle Association's Institute for Legislative Action, disagreed with the parliamentarian's ruling, noting that she was originally appointed by then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat.",
      "\u201cNevertheless, we remain committed to working with our allies on Capitol Hill to end the unjust tax burden on these constitutionally-protected arms,\u201d Commerford said.",
      "Groups opposed to the measure included Giffords, the gun violence prevention organization co-founded by former Rep. Gabby Giffords who was grievously wounded in a 2011 mass shooting in her district.",
      "Emma Brown, the group's executive director said \u201cremoving safeguards on gun silencers would have made it easier for violent criminals to escape, putting both law enforcement and civilians at greater risk.\u201d",
      "\"What\u2019s more, removing safeguards on short barreled firearms would have only enabled more criminals to access these easily concealable weapons, which can be easily brought into large crowds,\u201d Brown said.",
      "The gun language had broad support among Republicans and has received little attention as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., work to settle differences within the party on cuts to Medicaid and energy tax credits, among other issues.",
      "It is just one of hundreds of policy and spending items that were included to entice members to vote for the legislation and will have broad implications in the years to come.",

    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani's New York mayoral primary prompted a variety of reactions among the city's Democrats, with some vowing to oppose him and others offering support.",
    "story": [
      "The 33-year-old's success prompted varied reactions in the city.",
      "Just hours after Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani declared victory in New York's mayoral primary on Wednesday, a small group of business leaders convened with Mayor Eric Adams, who bypassed the Democratic primary and is instead running in the general election as an independent.",
      "Attendees were focused on strategizing how to prevent Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblymember, from winning the mayoralty -- and assessing whether Adams was the strongest contender to oppose him in November.",
      "Among those present was former NYC mayoral candidate and former hedge fund executive Whitney Tilson, who recently shared a debate stage with Mamdani. Tilson described Mamdani as \u201cvery charming and charismatic,\u201d but added he sharply disagrees with Mamdani\u2019s policies and \u201c[About] 5% [A small fraction] of New York City voters picked him\u2026 It's a totally rigged closed primary.\u201d",
      "Tilson told ABC News when it became clear the race was between two people, he had hoped former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo would win. He said he would \u201c...continue for the next 130 days what I began in earnest 45 days ago -- to make sure Zohran Mamdani, an unqualified radical socialist, does not become mayor of our city.\u201d",
      "Several other vexed moderate-minded Democrats, beyond the handful in the meeting with Adams, are making similar schemes, a Democratic source with knowledge of the conversations confirmed to ABC.",
      "That source suggested that some are mulling over boosting centrist lawyer Jim Walden, who is running as an independent, as a potential spoiler. And billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman (who supported Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election) pledged to bankroll whichever viable challenger vows to take on Mamdani in November.",
      "Linda Yaccarino, CEO of X, wrote that Mamdani\u2019s win was \"disastrous\" and that she, Ackman, and others must \u201cfigure out a way to save New York\u201d in response to his promise.",
      "However, former New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he\u2019s not aware of any progressives who are \u201cquaking in their boots about a particular scenario\u201d and that serious Mamdani supporters' worries come not from threats, but \u201cbecause we should be worried of the unknown, and no one should take this general election lightly.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's more than ironic that Ackman thinks he has anything left to say to anybody in the Democratic Party after his activities last few months,\u201d de Blasio told ABC News. \u201cAs some of these people are flailing about, they are only reminding people that Zohran\u2019s positions are going to be the majority positions in this town.\u201d",
      "The former mayor, whom Mamdani said was the best in his lifetime, said he doesn\u2019t believe the accusations of radicalism or extremism will stick, pointing to Mamdani's strong margins from Tuesday night.",
      "\u201cI think the magnitude of the victory has woken up a lot of people who were buying into stereotypes -- unfair stereotypes -- of Zohran,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cYou can't be extreme if such a clear majority want you. To use a New York City phrase: he's instantly been koshered.\"",
      "Mamdani isn\u2019t shielding himself from the incoming, either.",
      "Longtime New York powerbroker Kathryn Wylde told ABC News Mamdani called her Thursday evening, and expressed interest in meeting with the CEOs whom Wylde said were \u201cextremely concerned\u201d with his economic and fiscal policies.",
      "Wylde agreed -- and plans to host a meeting between Mamdani and any of the interested 300 plus executives who are members of Partnership for the City, where she serves as CEO, during the third week in July.",
      "\u201cThe business community will not determine who is mayor. But we want whomever is mayor to have relationships and understand the issues that will keep our city strong,\u201d Wylde said.",
      "His campaign told ABC News he\u2019s committed to meeting \u201cwith anyone and everyone.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Zohran has said throughout this campaign, he\u2019ll meet with anyone and everyone to move our city forward. Zohran\u2019s committed to delivering an administration of excellence that delivers an affordable and safe city for everyone, not just the wealthy and well-connected,\u201d Mamdani campaign spokesperson Lekha Sunder said in a statement.",
      "Mark Gorton, founder of LimeWire and chairman of Tower Research Capital hedge fund, said he donated $250,000 to Cuomo\u2019s super PAC, Fix the City, after it became clear that his preferred candidate, Brad Lander, would not win the primary. However, Gorton acknowledged to ABC News he did so reluctantly.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m tired of being on the outside -- I want to be on the inside,\u201d he said.",
      "Still, he knew his top concerns -- support for cyclists, reducing car traffic and expanding bus service -- were not priorities for Cuomo.",
      "\u201cCuomo was a disaster,\u201d the activist, who started a non-profit focused on New York\u2019s streets nearly three decades ago, said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t even show up at the candidate forum and drives around in a Dodge Charger.\u201d",
      "Gorton said he felt relieved when Cuomo lost, noting that both Mamdani and Lander are strong on the issues he cares about. If November\u2019s election were held today, he said, he would vote for Mamdani.",
      "When asked whether he would contribute to Mamdani\u2019s campaign, Gorton hesitated.",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t need my money. Money doesn\u2019t always make a difference,\" he said.",
      "Some Democrats in New York\u2019s Congressional delegation are distancing themselves from Mamdani. Speaking on WNYC\u2019s \"The Brian Lehrer Show\" on Thursday Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand declined to say who she would endorse. When pressed, she said: \u201cI vote in Albany,\u201d and will leave the decision to New York City voters.",
      "Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents a Long Island swing-district that includes some parts of Queens, posted on X that he continues to have \u201cserious concerns\u201d about Mamdani.",
      "Yet some of the highest ranking of the delegation seem open to Mamdani.",
      "Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, both of New York, praised Mamdani after his apparent primary win. Showing particular support for his campaign's focus on affordability, both vowed to meet with him. Rep. Gregory Meeks, (D-NY), also told ABC News he was looking to speak with the presumptive nominee.",
      "Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-NY), the most senior Jewish member of the House of Representatives, went even further. After backing one of Mamdani\u2019s challengers during the primary, Nadler has since endorsed Mamdani\u2019s general election bid.",
      "And former president Bill Clinton, who backed Cuomo, wrote on X that he is \u201cwishing [Mamdani] much success in November and beyond as you look to bring New Yorkers together.\u201d",
      "Veteran Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who once worked for Cuomo and is now a critic, told ABC News centrist Democrats are partially to blame for the former governor's loss and suggested they look in the mirror.",
      "\u201cIt is baffling that they decided to cast their lot with a disgraced former governor who was run out of office and had no new ideas or inspirational message to offer New Yorkers. Spare us the freak out,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis just seems like the last gasp of the establishment and the affiliated billionaires trying to stop a grassroots moment that, frankly, they helped fuel.\u201d",

      "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are set to attend the funeral of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman on Saturday",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris will join the mourners Saturday at the funeral for former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman, who was killed in a pair of attacks that authorities have called an assassination and that also left her husband dead and a state senator and his wife seriously wounded.",
      "Biden also paid his respects Friday as Hortman, her husband, Mark, and their golden retriever, Gilbert, lay in state in the Minnesota Capitol rotunda in St. Paul, a few hours after the man charged with killing them while disguised as a police officer June 14 made a brief court appearance in a suicide prevention suit.",
      "The couple\u2019s private funeral, at the Basilica of Saint Mary in Minneapolis, is set for 10:30 a.m. Saturday. It will be livestreamed on the Department of Public Safety\u2019s YouTube channel.",
      "Neither Biden nor Harris is expected to speak. Harris expressed her condolences earlier this week to Hortman\u2019s adult children, and spoke with Gov. Tim Walz, her running mate on the 2024 Democratic presidential ticket, who extended an invitation on behalf of the Hortman family, her office said.",
      "Hortman, a Democrat, was the first woman and one of fewer than 20 Minnesotans to lay in state at the Capitol. It was the first time a couple has been accorded the honor, and the first for a dog. Gilbert was seriously wounded in the attack and had to be euthanized. The Hortmans' caskets and the dog's urn were arranged in the center of the rotunda, under the Capitol dome, with law enforcement officers keeping watch as thousands of people filed by. Many fought back tears as they left.",
      "Among the first to pay their respects were Walz, who has called Hortman his closest political ally, and his wife, Gwen. Biden, a Catholic, visited later in the afternoon, walking up to the velvet rope in front of the caskets, making the sign of the cross and spending a few moments by himself in silence. He then took a knee briefly, got up, made the sign of the cross again and walked off to greet people waiting in the wings of the rotunda.",
      "Lisa Greene, who lives in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park like Hortman did, but in a different House district, said she came to the Capitol because she had so much respect for the former speaker.",
      "\u201cShe was just amazing. Amazing woman. And I was just so proud that she represented the city that I lived in,\u201d Greene said in a voice choked with emotion. \u201cShe was such a leader. She could bring people together. She was so accessible. I mean, she was friendly, you could talk to her.\"",
      "But, she went on to say admiringly, Hortman was also \u201ca boss.\"",
      "\u201cShe just knew what she was doing and she could just make things happen,\u201d she said.",
      "The man accused of killing the Hortmans at their home and wounding Democratic state Sen. John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in nearby Champlin, made a short court appearance Friday for what the acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, Joseph Thompson, has called \u201ca political assassination.\u201d",
      "Vance Boelter, 57, of Green Isle, surrendered near his home the night of June 15 after what authorities called the largest search in Minnesota history.",
      "An unshaven Boelter was brought in wearing just a green padded suicide prevention suit and orange slippers. Federal defender Manny Atwal asked Magistrate Judge Douglas Micko to continue the hearing until Thursday. He agreed. She said Boelter has been sleep deprived while on suicide watch in the Sherburne County Jail, and that it has been difficult to communicate with him as a result.",
      "\u201cYour honor, I haven't really slept in about 12 to 14 days,\" Boelter told the judge. And he denied being suicidal. \"I\u2019ve never been suicidal and I am not suicidal now.\u201d",
      "Atwal told the court that Boelter had been in what's known as a \u201cGumby suit,\u201d without undergarments, ever since his transfer to the jail after his first court appearance on June 16. She said the lights are on in his area 24 hours a day, doors slam frequently, the inmate in the next cell spreads feces on the walls and the smell drifts to Boelter's cell.",
      "The attorney said transferring him to segregation instead, and giving him a normal jail uniform, would let him get some sleep, restore some dignity and let him communicate better.",
      "Boelter did not enter a plea. Prosecutors need to secure a grand jury indictment first. According to the federal complaint, police video shows Boelter outside the Hortmans\u2019 home and captures the sound of gunfire. And it says security video shows Boelter approaching the front doors of two other lawmakers\u2019 homes.",
      "His lawyers have declined to comment on the charges, which could carry the federal death penalty. Thompson said last week that no decision has been made. Minnesota abolished its death penalty in 1911. Boelter also faces separate murder and attempted murder charges in state court that could carry life without parole.",
      "Friends have described Boelter as an evangelical Christian with politically conservative views. But prosecutors have declined so far to speculate on a motive.",

      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause",
      "More than four years after a Florida condominium collapse killed 98 people, federal investigators have yet to make a final determination of the cause \u2014 but they do have some leading theories.",
      "The National Institute of Standards and Technology, the agency handling the probe, said this week it hopes to conclude the investigation in 2026.",
      "\u201cWe intend for our investigation of this failure to have a lasting impact, save future lives and ensure this never happens again,\u201d NIST investigator Judith Mitrani-Reiser said in the agency's latest report.",
      "Most residents were asleep in the 12-story Champlain Towers South when the beachfront condo building in Surfside, Florida, collapsed into a huge pile of rubble at 1:22 a.m. on June 24, 2021. As the investigation continued, a Miami judge approved a more than $1 billion settlement for personal injury and wrongful death claims from the disaster.",
      "Meanwhile, a new luxury condominium is going up at the Champlain Towers site, a few miles north of Miami.",
      "NIST has zeroed in on what it calls three \u201chigher-likelihood\u201d scenarios, all related to construction flaws that date to the beginning of the 40-year-old structure.",
      "\u201cThese conditions existed from the time construction was complete, 40 years before the partial collapse,\" said Glen Bell, co-lead investigator on NIST\u2019s National Construction Safety Team.",
      "One possibility is the failure of a connection between a building column and the pool deck slab that never met building code standards. Another is that steel reinforcement \u201cwas not placed where it should have been,\u201d which meant the column and pool deck were far too weak.",
      "And a third theory is that work done later around the pool \u2014 when heavy planters, sand and pavers were added \u2014 increased the weight load on a deck \u201cthat was already functionally and structurally inadequate.\u201d",
      "The NIST report also notes that support columns in the building's basement parking garage had been exposed to frequent flooding, which causes corrosion in steel reinforcements and concrete deterioration.",
      "Investigators did not find evidence of voids in the ground under the building, known as \u201ckarst.\u201d Using satellite data, the NIST team found there was no sinking or settling underneath Champlain Towers, which would indicate existence of karst.",
      "In addition, investigators found the limestone upon which the condo was built was \u201csufficient to carry the building loads\" and that testing of the concrete supporting Champlain Towers had \u201cadequate material strength.\u201d",
      "One challenge for investigators was the lack of any available records from the original building construction and not many from its earlier years.",
      "After Surfside, state legislators enacted a law in 2022 requiring condo associations to have sufficient reserves to cover major repairs. Some residents were caught off guard by hefty fees imposed to cover years of deferred maintenance expenses required to bring their buildings into compliance with the law's standards.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis this week signed new legislation allowing some condo associations to fund their reserves through a loan or line of credit. It also gives residents more flexibility to pause payments into reserve funds while they prioritize needed repairs. It extends the deadline for condo associations to complete structural integrity studies and exempts some smaller buildings from those studies.",
      "\u201cNow it\u2019s time to make the change,\u201d state Sen. Ed Hooper said. \u201cElderly people are losing their condos because they could not afford to make the increase in their monthly HOA fees. That\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "It's a luxury condo building, dubbed the Delmore, with 37 \u201cmansions in the sky\u201d and a starting price of $15 million. The site was purchased at auction by Dubai-based DAMAC International for $120 million.",
      "According to the company, there will be amenities such as a see-through swimming pool, an indoor pool, an outdoor kitchen, a fitness center and a meditation garden.",
      "The new condo is expected to be completed by 2029.",
      "A design for a memorial to the 98 victims and that honors their families was approved earlier this year by Surfside officials and a family committee. But the city's planning and zoning board objected to its appearance and recommended that alternatives be considered.",
      "The existing proposal envisions a tall \u201cwall of water\u201d and exhibition of materials from the collapsed building. Surfside officials say they want to keep the project on track but will consider additional input, especially from the family committee.",
      "\u201cI understand the urgency. But this memorial is going to be here long beyond anyone in this room,\" said planning board chair Lindsay Lecour at an April city commission meeting.",

      "Fireworks are as American as apple pie",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Like clockwork, Carla Johnson sends out letters every spring asking for donations to help pay for the annual Fourth of July fireworks show that draws tens of thousands of people to New Mexico's largest lake.",
      "And she has no reservations about doling out verbal reminders when she sees her patrons around town. There's too much at stake to be shy about fundraising when donations collected by Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park are what make the tradition possible.",
      "But even Johnson\u2019s ardent efforts as the group's fundraiser might not cut it next year if the U.S. and China remain locked in a trade war.",
      "With nearly all of the aerial shells, paper rockets and sparkly fountains that fuel America's Fourth of July celebrations being imported from China, volunteer groups like Johnson's and cities big and small have been closely watching the negotiations.",
      "A 90-day pause on what had been massive tariffs brought some temporary relief, but industry experts acknowledge that the tiff has lit a fuse of uncertainty as the price tag for future fireworks displays could skyrocket if an agreement isn\u2019t reached.",
      "There were similar concerns in 2019 as trade talks between the U.S. and China dragged on. Industry groups had called on officials then to exempt fireworks from escalating tariffs.",
      "The American Pyrotechnics Association and the National Fireworks Association reignited the lobbying effort this spring, noting in letters to President Donald Trump that fireworks play a crucial role in American celebrations. The groups say the industry is made up mostly of family-owned companies that are often locked into long-term contracts that leave them unable to raise prices to offset cost surges brought on by higher tariffs.",
      "And there are few options for sourcing the more than 300 million pounds (136 million kilograms) of fireworks needed to feed demands. China produces 99% of consumer fireworks and 90% of professional display fireworks used in the U.S., according to the APA.",
      "\u201cI think overall it\u2019s the uncertainty,\u201d said Julie Heckman, the APA's executive director. \u201cYeah, we have a 90-day pause, but are the negotiations with China going to go well? Or is it going to go sky-high again? You know, triple digits. It\u2019s very hard for a small business to plan.\"",
      "Fireworks have their roots in China. To ward off evil spirits, people would throw bamboo stalks into a fire, causing them to pop as the air inside the hollow pockets heated up. These early firecrackers evolved into more sophisticated fireworks after the Chinese developed gunpowder in the 9th century.",
      "By the 15th century, Europe was using fireworks for religious festivals and entertainment. In 1777, they were used in Philadelphia and Boston for what were the first organized Independence Day celebrations.",
      "Now, fireworks are synonymous with the summer holiday and with ringing in the new year. Shows have become elaborately choreographed displays that are often synced to live music. In Nashville, the Music City's award-winning symphony orchestra puts its own spin on the festivities.",
      "In New York City, organizers of the Macy's show will fire off 80,000 shells, with some reaching heights of 1,000 feet (304 meters). The National Park Service promises a spectacular show on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.",
      "At Elephant Butte in southern New Mexico, they're going old school and will light the fireworks by hand. Charlie Warren, vice president of the Friends of Elephant Butte Lake State Park, said it's like spectators are getting two shows at once as the colors reflect on the water below and the loud booms reverberate off the lake.",
      "Johnson, who also serves as the group's treasurer, gets emotional describing the experience.",
      "\u201cOh man, in my heart and sometimes out loud, I\u2019m singing the Star-Spangled Banner. I\u2019ll sing it out loud to the top of my lungs when I watch that show,\" she said. \u201cIt makes you proud to be in this country, and we\u2019re celebrating our freedom, and I\u2019m going to start crying now. Don\u2019t get me started.\u201d",
      "Organizers in Nashville ordered fireworks for that show over a year ago so they weren't affected by the tariffs. It was the same in one of New Mexico's largest cities, where Rio Rancho officials planned to spend a little more to go bigger and higher this year.",
      "In Oklahoma, Big Blast Fireworks supplies nonprofit groups so they can fundraise by setting up fireworks stands. The company received its first container from China in January before the tariffs hit. The second container arrived in February and was subject to a 10% tariff. The third container was put on hold to avoid the highest tariffs, meaning inventory could be tight later this year if nothing changes.",
      "\u201cAs a small business, we are passionate about watching our price points and intentional about passing along as much savings on to customers as possible,\" said Melissa Torkleson, a managing partner at Big Blast.",
      "With some orders on hold, industry experts say Chinese manufacturers throttled back production as warehouses filled up. The backup in the supply chain also has resulted in competition for shipping space aboard ocean vessels, and Heckman, the APA's director, said it will take much more than flipping a light switch to ease either situation.",
      "If the trade war drags on, she said, there are ways that show organizers can adjust and spectators might not notice. A minute or two could be shaved from a show or certain types of fireworks could be substituted with less expensive options.",
      "As for this year, Warren said the price tag for the Elephant Butte show was unchanged and he and Johnson can't wait to see spectators lining the shoreline, on the surrounding hillsides and on boats bobbing on the lake. The mission every year is to make sure \u201cthat the T's are all crossed,\" Warren said.",
      "\"Because this community would not be happy if this show didn\u2019t come off,\u201d he said.",

      "Child safety advocates are warning about the dangers of heatstroke from leaving kids in hot cars",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- A record heat wave that spread across the East Coast of the United States during the first week of summer has child advocates warning parents and caretakers about the risks of heatstroke to children left inside hot vehicles.",
      "So far this year, nine children have died after being left unattended in vehicles in California, Florida, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New Jersey and North Carolina, according to Kids and Car Safety, which collects data on hot car deaths. Five died in June.",
      "And last year, 39 children in the U.S. died after being left in hot cars.",
      "Human-caused climate change keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists say. But the temperature outside doesn't have to be super hot for a child left in a vehicle to be affected by the heat, said Kathy Wall, director of Safe Kids Palm Beach County.",
      "\u201cInside, the vehicle can heat up 20 degrees in just 20 minutes,\u201d Wall said. \u201cSo if you imagine it\u2019s an 80 degree day, which in South Florida is a cool day, it could be over 100 degrees within 10 minutes inside the car.\"",
      "Hot car deaths can happen any time of year, and since 1998, every state but Alaska has reported a hot car death, according to the National Safety Council. In both 2018 and 2019, a record 53 children died after being left in hot cars.",
      "About 80% of the heat rise in vehicles happens in the first 30 minutes of a child being left inside, when maximum temperatures can exceed 150 degrees Fahrenheit (65 degrees Celsius), according to data compiled by Jan Null, a certified consulting meteorologist at San Jose State University.",
      "\u201cChildren sweat a lot less than adults do and their internal temperature can increase three to five times faster than an adult. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s just as important to make sure that your child isn\u2019t left in the vehicle, especially during these rising temperatures,\" said Capt. Karen Derogatis of Palm Beach County Fire Rescue.",
      "While it\u2019s easy to place blame for leaving a child in a vehicle, even people trained to know the dangers have made that tragic mistake, Wall said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a socioeconomic group, it\u2019s not a cultural group,\u201d she said. \u201cThis sadly has happened to doctors, it\u2019s happened to dentists, it happened to school teachers, it\u2019s happened to child care workers. Nobody is exempt from this.\u201d",
      "Distraction often leads to forgetting about a child in the backseat, which is why it is important to create routines and reminders, she said.",
      "\u201cIt sounds crazy, but sometimes people get out of routines or are distracted, especially in today\u2019s world. There\u2019s lots going on in the news, lots going with families,\u201d she said.",
      "A parent who normally doesn't drop a child off at a day care facility might become distracted and forget that the child is in the vehicle, she said.",
      "She encourages parents and caregivers to establish routines.",
      "\u201cWe have an acronym, ACT,\" Wall said.",
      "A stands for avoiding leaving a child unattended in a vehicle.",
      "C stands for creating a reminder that works best for you. Authorities suggest leaving a personal item such as a purse or briefcase in the backseat so you'll have to open the back door before locking the vehicle.",
      "T is to take action right away. \u201cIf you see a child in a car, don\u2019t try to figure out how long they\u2019ve been in the car. Call 911 immediately,\" Wall said.",
      "Some newer cars offer warnings for drivers to check the backseat for passengers.",
      "Double checking the vehicle is key, said Derogatis, the fire captain.",
      "\"If you make it a common habit, just like you would look in their rear view mirror to see if somebody\u2019s behind you, or if you look at your side view mirror to see if you want to switch lanes, make it habit to look in your rearview mirror, whether you have a child or an animal or anything, just to ensure that they are as safe as possible,\u201d she said.",

      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her Cowboy Carter tour has caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born pop star",
      "A T-shirt worn by Beyonc\u00e9 during a Juneteenth performance on her \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d tour has sparked a discussion over how Americans frame their history and caused a wave of criticism for the Houston-born superstar.",
      "The T-shirt worn during a concert in Paris featured images of the Buffalo Soldiers, who belonged to Black U.S. Army units active during the late 1800s and early 1900s. On the back was a lengthy description of the soldiers that included \u201cTheir antagonists were the enemies of peace, order and settlement: warring Indians, bandits, cattle thieves, murderous gunmen, bootleggers, trespassers, and Mexican revolutionaries.\u201d",
      "Images of the shirt and videos of the performance are also featured on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s website.",
      "As she prepares to return to the U.S. for performances in her hometown this weekend, fans and Indigenous influencers took to social media to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 for framing Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries as anything but the victims of American imperialism and promoting anti-Indigenous language.",
      "A publicist for Beyonc\u00e9 did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Buffalo Soldiers served in six military units created after the Civil War in 1866. They were comprised formerly enslaved men, freemen, and Black Civil War soldiers and fought in hundreds of conflicts \u2014 including in the Spanish-American War, World War I, and World War II \u2014 until they were disbanded in 1951.",
      "As the quote on Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s shirt notes, they also fought numerous battles against Indigenous peoples as part of the U.S. Army's campaign of violence and land theft during the country's westward expansion.",
      "Some historians say the moniker \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d was bestowed by the tribes who admired the bravery and tenacity of the fighters, but that might be more legend than fact. \u201cAt the end of the day, we really don\u2019t have that kind of information,\u201d said Cale Carter, director of exhibitions at the Buffalo Soldiers National Museum in Houston.",
      "Carter and other museum staff said that, only in the past few years, the museum made broader efforts to include more of the complexities of the battles the Buffalo Soldiers fought against Native Americans and Mexican revolutionaries and the role they played in the subjugation of Indigenous peoples. They, much like many other museums across the country, are hoping to add more nuance to the framing of American history and be more respectful of the ways they have caused harm to Indigenous communities.",
      "\u201cWe romanticize the Western frontier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe early stories that talked about the Buffalo Soldiers were impacted by a lot of those factors. So you really didn\u2019t see a changing in that narrative until recently.\u201d",
      "There has often been a lack of diverse voices discussing the way Buffalo Soldiers history is framed, said Michelle Tovar, the museum's director of education. The current political climate has put enormous pressure on schools, including those in Texas, to avoid honest discussions about American history, she said.",
      "\u201cRight now, in this area, we are getting push back from a lot of school districts in which we can\u2019t go and teach this history,\" Tovar said. \"We are a museum where we can at least be a hub, where we can invite the community regardless of what districts say, invite them to learn it and do what we can do the outreach to continue to teach honest history.\u201d",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's recent album \u201cAct II: Cowboy Carter\u201d has played on a kind of American iconography, which many see as her way of subverting the country music genre's adjacency to whiteness and reclaiming the cowboy aesthetic for Black Americans. Last year, she became the first Black woman ever to top Billboard's country music chart, and \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d won her the top prize at the 2025 Grammy Awards, album of the year.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers play this major role in the Black ownership of the American West,\u201d said Tad Stoermer, a historian and professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIn my view, (Beyonc\u00e9 is) well aware of the role that these images play. This is the \u2018Cowboy Carter\u2019 tour for crying out loud. The entire tour, the entire album, the entire piece is situated in this layered narrative.\u201d",
      "But Stoermer also points out that the Buffalo Soldier have been framed in the American story in a way that also plays into the myths of American nationalism.",
      "As Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Buffalo Soldiers imagery implies, Black Americans also use their story to claim agency over their role in the creation of the country, said Alaina E. Roberts, a historian, author and professor at Pittsburgh University who studies the intersection of Black and Native American life from the Civil War to present day.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the category in which she thought maybe she was coming into this conversation, but the Buffalo Soldiers are even a step above that because they were literally involved in not just the settlement of the West but of genocide in a sense,\u201d she said.",
      "Several Native influencers, performers, and academics took to social media this week to criticize Beyonc\u00e9 or call the language on her shirt anti-Indigenous. \u201cDo you think Beyonc\u00e9 will apologize (or acknowledge) the shirt,\u201d indigenous.tv, an Indigenous news and culture Instagram account with more than 130,000, asked in a post Thursday.",
      "Many of her critics, as well as fans, agree. A flood of social media posts called out the pop star for the historic framing on the shirt.",
      "\u201cThe Buffalo Soldiers are an interesting historical moment to look at. But we have to be honest about what they did, especially in their operations against Indigenous Americans and Mexicans,\u201d said Chisom Okorafor, who posts on TikTok under the handle @confirmedsomaya.",
      "Okorafor said there is no \u201cprogressive\u201d way to reclaim America's history of empire building in the West, and that Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s use of Western symbolism sends a problematic message.",
      "\u201cWhich is that Black people too can engage in American nationalism,\" she said. \"Black people too can profit from the atrocities of American empire. It is a message that tells you to abandon immigrants, Indigenous people, and people who live outside of the United States. It is a message that tells you not only is it a virtue to have been born in this country but the longer your line extends in this country the more virtuous you are.\u201d",

      "The success of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic primary for mayor is euphoric for Hari Kondabolu, a stand-up comedian who's been friends with the candidate for 15 years.",
      "Mamdani stunned the political establishment when he declared victory in the primary on Tuesday, a ranked choice election in which his strongest competition, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, conceded defeat.",
      "When he launched his campaign, the unabashed democratic socialist ranked near the bottom of the pack. Now, the 33-year-old state assemblyman has a chance to be New York City's first Asian American and Muslim mayor. Mamdani's family came to the United States when he was 7, and he became a citizen in 2018. He was born to Indian parents in Kampala, Uganda.",
      "For Kondabolu, this moment is not just exciting, but emotional.",
      "\u201cI think so many of us have had those experiences in New York of being brown and in a city that has always been really diverse and feels like ours. But after 9/11, like you start to question it like, is this our city too,\u201d Kondabolu said. \u201cAnd 25 years later ... it\u2019s surreal, like this is the same city but it\u2019s not because we\u2019ve elected this person.\u201d",
      "Mamdani's campaign has piqued the interest of many Indian, Pakistani and other South Asian Americans, as well as Muslims \u2014 even those who may not agree with Mamdani on every issue.

      "\u201cAs a Muslim American, this victory puts my trust back in the people,\u201d said Sardar, who was born and raised in India. \u201cI am happy that there are people who value the candidate and his policies more than his personal religious beliefs and didn\u2019t vote him down because of the color of his skin, or the fact that he was an immigrant with an uncommon name.\u201d",

      "But the 34-year-old \u2014 who donated, voted and canvassed for Mamdani \u2014 said it was his vision for New York City that was the draw for her. She and her husband briefly chatted with Mamdani at a fundraiser and she found him to be \u201cvery friendly and genuine.\u201d",
      "She suspects that for some who aren\u2019t very politically active, Mamdani\u2019s political ascent could make a difference.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of Muslim communities like my parents\u2019 generation who are focused a lot more on the politics back home and less on the politics here in America,\u201d said Shabbir. \u201cSeeing people like Zohran Mamdani be in office, it\u2019ll really change that perspective in a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Supporters and pundits agree that Mamdani's campaign has demonstrated social media savvy and authenticity. He visited multiple mosques. In videos, he speaks in Hindi or gives a touch of Bollywood. Other South Asian American politicians such as Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna praised that.",
      "\u201cI love that he didn\u2019t run away from his heritage. I mean, he did video clips with Amitabh Bachchan and Hindi movies,\u201d Khanna said, referencing the Indian actor. \u201cHe shows that one can embrace their roots and their heritage and yet succeed in American politics.\u201d",

      "She found Mamdani to be \u201cunabashedly Muslim\u201d and also \u201ca voice, who, literally, to me sounds like a New Yorker who\u2019s stepping in and saying, hey, let\u2019s reclaim our power,\u201d she said.",
      "While Mamdani has been speaking to the working class, he had a somewhat privileged upbringing. His mother is filmmaker Mira Nair and his father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a professor at Columbia University.",
      "He lived in Queens but attended The Bronx High School of Science. Even as a teen, he cared about social justice, Kondabolu, the comedian, recalled.",
      "His campaign messaging on issues such as affordable housing and free bus rides might not resonate with South Asian households in New York City who have income levels above the median. But, the irony is that his campaign and \u201cgreat kind of soundbites\u201d earned support from that demographic, too, according to Sur.",
      "\u201cIt was, I think, a surprise that he did so well among the wealthiest, including his own community,\u201d Sur said.",
      "Mamdani\u2019s outspoken support for Palestinian causes and criticism of Israel and its military campaign in Gaza resonated with pro-Palestinian residents, including Muslims, but caused tension in the mayor\u2019s race. Some of his positions and remarks on the charged issue have drawn recriminations from opponents and some Jewish groups, though he\u2019s also been endorsed by some Jewish politicians and activists.",
      "Mamdani's success immediately elicited strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant rhetoric from some high-profile conservatives on social media, including conservative media personality Charlie Kirk who posted that \u201clegal immigration can ruin your country.\u201d In response, Democratic Congressman Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, tweeted \u201cFor years they sold people the lie of \u2018we have no problem if you come the right way!\u2019\u201d",

      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California should pause Gov. Gavin Newsom's plan to penalize oil companies if their profits climb too high, a top energy regulator said Friday while unveiling proposals aimed at addressing high gas prices.",
      "The Democratic governor signed a law in 2023 giving the California Energy Commission the authority to penalize oil companies for excess profits, declaring the state had \u201cfinally beat big oil.\u201d More than two years later, the commission hasn't imposed a single penalty or determined what counts as an excessive profit.",
      "Now, Siva Gunda, the energy commission's vice-chair, says the state should pause the effort in favor of pursuing other policies to lower prices and maintain a steady oil supply \u2014 all while pushing to phase out reliance on fossil fuels over the next two decades.",
      "\u201cTogether, we will evolve California\u2019s strategy to successfully phase out petroleum-based fuels by 2045 while protecting communities, workers, and consumers, and foster market conditions that support the industry\u2019s ability to operate safely, reliably, and successfully to meet demand through the transition,\u201d Gunda wrote in a letter to Newsom.",
      "Gunda's recommended pause of the penalty would have to be agreed upon by the full commission. Newsom has pitched the penalty as a way to rein in profits by oil companies, but critics said it would only raise prices.",
      "California has the highest gas prices in the nation, largely due to taxes and environmental regulations. Regular unleaded gas prices were $4.61 a gallon Friday, compared to a national average of $3.20, according to AAA.",
      "The commission still plans to set rules that would require oil refineries to keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to avoid shortages when refineries go offline for maintenance, Gunda said. That proposal came out of a law Newsom signed last year after convening a special session aimed at preventing gas price spikes.",
      "Gunda's recommendations come months after Newsom in April directed energy regulators to work with refiners on plans to ensure the state maintains a reliable fuel supply as it transitions away from fossil fuels.",

      "Two major oil companies announced plans over the past year to shut down refineries in the state, further driving uncertainty about how the state should maintain a stable fuel supply as California transitions toward renewable energy. Phillips 66 announced plans to shut down its Los Angeles-area refinery, and Valero said it would cease operations at its Benicia refinery. The two refineries combined account for more than 17% of the state's refining capacity, according to the energy commission.",
      "A group of about 50 environmental and consumer groups penned a letter to Newsom and legislative leaders Friday criticizing the proposal to pause implementing a penalty on oil company profits.",

      "PHOENIX -- Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs signed legislation Friday that funds up to $500 million in renovations to Chase Field, home of the Arizona Diamondbacks.",
      "The bill, which won bipartisan support in both of the state's GOP-controlled chambers, will use sales tax revenue from the stadium and nearby buildings for infrastructure upgrades over the next 30 years, including improvements to air conditioning systems and the stadium\u2019s retractable roof.",
      "The team said it will also contribute $250 million for the renovations at the stadium, which is located in downtown Phoenix and is surrounded by small businesses and restaurants that see a boost of activity during the baseball season.",
      "The legislation is one of a handful of bipartisan deals that Hobbs, a Democrat, prioritized negotiating during the session. She says the funding is a responsible use of taxpayer dollars, will provide good-paying jobs and ensure the Diamondbacks do not leave Phoenix.",
      "Attendance at games has increased since the team's 2023 run to the World Series, where the Diamondbacks lost to the Texas Rangers. This season they are averaging 31,420 fans per game \u2014 the highest in two decades.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not going to let Arizona lose the Diamondbacks,\u201d Hobbs said Friday on the social platform X.",
      "Derrick Hall, president and CEO of the Diamondbacks, praised the governor and said the team will now turn its attention to extending its lease with Maricopa County.",
      "The bill cleared the Legislature June 23 after months of debate that included the question of whether the Diamondbacks could potentially leave unless a public funding deal was reached.",
      "Other MLB teams have threatened to leave host cities if they did not get public financing.",
      "The Oakland A's, for example, complained for years about the Oakland Coliseum and an inability to gain government assistance for a new ballpark. Now the team is bound for Las Vegas, where a groundbreaking ceremony was held this month for a $1.75 billion ballpark that is expected to be completed in time for the 2028 season. Nevada and Clark County approved up to $380 million in public funds for the project.",
      "And last year voters in Jackson County, Missouri, rejected an attempt to extend a sales tax that would have helped fund a ballpark for the Kansas City Royals and stadium renovations for the Kansas City Chiefs. Lawmakers in Kansas are trying to lure the teams with government subsidies, and Missouri is trying to keep them with its own financial incentives.",
      "The Diamondbacks have spent nearly three decades in their downtown ballpark, which is owned by the Maricopa County Stadium District. In 2017, the team sued the district over funding for repairs and sought to remove a contractual clause preventing the team from looking into other stadium options.",
      "A perennial problem has been the park's air conditioning system and its ability to keep it cool in triple-digit summer heat, Hall said. Fans of country music star Morgan Wallen bemoaned the heat at a concert there last July, despite the retractable roof being closed. Concession stands ran out of water, and some people simply left.",
      "Chase Field was one of the first MLB stadiums to have a retractable roof. Now seven out of the 30 teams play under one, including the Brewers, Blue Jays, Rangers, Marlins, Astros and Mariners. Chase Field also has a small swimming pool in right field, one of its most recognizable features.",
      "The funding from the Legislature will not mean upgrades to the pool or to stadium suites, the latter of which was a sticking point for Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego. She got on board after the bill was updated to prevent funds from being used for suites and a cap was placed on how much money the city would contribute for a land deal should the Diamondbacks break from the Stadium District, according to Gallego chief of staff Seth Scott.",
      "Hobbs is running for reelection, and while it's too early to say whether the Diamondbacks funding will be part of her campaign messaging, it's another bipartisan win, her communications director Michael Beyer said.",
      "Democratic state Sen. Mitzi Epstein, who voted against the funding, said Hobbs' support for the bill was wrong and hurtful for Arizonans. She said she was disappointed that amendments to create public benefits such as free streaming of games failed.",

NetChoice \u2014 whose members include TikTok, Facebook parent Meta, and the social platform X \u2014 challenged Arkansas' 2023 age-verification law for social media. A federal judge who initially blocked the law struck it down in March.",
      "Similar laws have been blocked by judges in Florida and Georgia.",
      "A spokesperson for Attorney General Tim Griffin said his office was reviewing the latest complaint and looked forward to defending the law.",
      "One of the new laws being challenged prohibits social media platforms from using a design, algorithm or feature it \u201cknows or should have known through the exercise of reasonable care\u201d would cause a user to kill themself, purchase a controlled substance, develop an eating disorder, develop an addiction to the platform.",
      "The lawsuit said that provision is unconstitutionally vague and doesn't offer guidance on how to determine which content would violate those restrictions, and the suit notes it would restrict content for both adults and minors. The suit questions whether songs that mention drugs, such as Afroman's \u201cBecause I Got High,\u201d would be prohibited under the new law.",
      "The law being challenged also would allow parents whose children have died by suicide or attempted to take their lives to sue social media companies if they were exposed to content promoting or advancing self-harm and suicide. The companies could face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per violation.",
      "NetChoice is also challenging another law that attempts to expand Arkansas' blocked restrictions on social media companies. That measure would require social media platforms to ensure minors don't receive notifications between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.",
      "The measure also would require social media companies to ensure their platform \u201cdoes not engage in practices to evoke any addiction or compulsive behavior.\u201d The suit argues that the law doesn't explain how to comply with that restriction and is so broadly written that it's unclear what kind of posts or material would violate it.",
      "\u201cWhat is \u2018addictive\u2019 to some minors may not be addictive to others. Does allowing teens to share photos with each other evoke addiction?\u201d the lawsuit said.",

      "NFL coach Jim Harbaugh has been added to a lawsuit against the University of Michigan and a former assistant football coach who is accused of hacking into the computer accounts of college athletes to look for intimate photos",
      "DETROIT -- NFL coach Jim Harbaugh was added Friday to a lawsuit against the University of Michigan and a former assistant football coach who is accused of hacking into the computer accounts of college athletes across the U.S. to look for intimate photos.",
      "Attorneys claim Harbaugh, who was Michigan's coach, and others knew that Matt Weiss was seen viewing private information on a computer in December 2022 but still allowed him to continue working as co-offensive coordinator in a national playoff game roughly a week later.",
      "Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel and other officials were also added to the lawsuit in federal court in Detroit.",
      "\u201cThe university's delay in taking meaningful protective action until after a high-stakes game sends a clear message: Student welfare was secondary,\u201d said Parker Stinar, who is the lead lawyer in a class-action lawsuit arising from a criminal investigation of Weiss.",
      "Messages seeking comment from Manuel and Harbaugh, who is currently the head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers, were not immediately returned Friday.",
      "Separately, Weiss has been charged with identity theft and unauthorized computer access from 2015 to 2023. The indictment says he got access to the social media, email and cloud storage accounts of more than 2,000 college athletes, as well as more than 1,300 students or alumni from schools across the U.S., to find private images, primarily of women. He has pleaded not guilty.",
      "\u201cHad Harbaugh implemented basic oversight of his staff, plaintiffs and the class would have been protected against predators such as Weiss,\u201d the updated lawsuit states. \u201cInstead, Weiss was a highly compensated asset that was promoted by and within the football program, from which position he was able to, and did, target female student athletes.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit says a staff member saw Weiss viewing private information at Schembechler Hall, headquarters for the football team, around Dec. 21, 2022, and reported it before Michigan played Texas Christian University in a playoff game days later on Dec. 31.",
      "Weiss was fired a few weeks later in January 2023 during an investigation of his computer use.",
      "Earlier this year, after charges were filed, Harbaugh told reporters that he didn't know anything about Weiss' troubles until after the playoff game. He said the allegations were \"shocking.\"",
      "Weiss worked for Harbaugh's brother, John, on the coaching staff of the NFL's Baltimore Ravens before joining the Michigan team in 2021.",
      "The lawsuit says Weiss\u2019 university computer had encryption software that had to be disabled by an external vendor as part of the investigation. Authorities disclosed in April that thousands of intimate photos and videos were found on his electronic devices and cloud storage accounts.",

      "Thousands of motorists have been stranded in West Virginia after a mudslide sent water and debris onto highway",
      "Thousands of motorists were stranded for more than eight hours along a section of rural interstate highway in southern West Virginia early Friday after a mudslide caused by heavy rains blocked a storm drain the previous night, flooding the northbound lanes.",
      "Traffic backed up for 12 miles (about 19 kilometers) along the West Virginia Turnpike about 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Charleston, the state capital. Traffic was not rerouted, and many motorists along the mountainous route had no choice but to remain in their vehicles overnight.",
      "Motorists posted on social media that they had no information on why the standstill occurred, that they had nothing to drink in their vehicles or that their children needed to use the bathroom.",
      "Nicky Walters said in a telephone interview that she felt fortunate while she was stuck because she is healthy, did not not need medicine and had nobody she was responsible for caring for.",
      "\u201cBut I felt desperate because I knew that other people needed help,\u201d said Walters, who became stranded while returning to Charleston from a pro wrestling event in Mount Hope. \u201cPeople needed, at minimum, water bottles passed out and some snacks, much less information. They needed any lifeline to the outside world, and there was none.\u201d",
      "Chuck Smith, executive director of the West Virginia Parkways Authority, said one lane reopened Friday morning but traffic remained at a standstill for hours.",
      "\u201cTraffic should have been detoured to allow drivers an alternate route around the mudslide,\u201d Smith said in a statement. \u201cThe Parkways Authority takes full responsibility for the failure to reroute traffic, and would like to assure the public that this will never happen again.\u201d",
      "No injuries were reported.",
      "By the time Brittany Lemon and her family finally got home to Parkersburg, 24 hours had passed since they began returning from their vacation in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.",
      "In a video posted to Facebook, Lemon said she had no water and her children needed to use the bathroom. They were able to get an hour's sleep while stuck on the highway.",
      "\u201cDefinitely next year when I go back, I\u2019ll be prepared for an emergency in the vehicle,\" she said.",

      "Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement that the shutdown \"was completely unacceptable. I have directed the Parkways Authority to immediately conduct an investigation and revise its procedures as necessary as a result of this incident.\"",
      "Shutdowns of the turnpike have happened before. In 2022 a tractor trailer crashed and spilled a chemical along the turnpike, closing all lanes for most of the day.",

      "Antoine Massey, 33, was taken into custody at a residence in New Orleans about 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the jail, said New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick.",
      "\u201cHe actually walked out of a home peacefully,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \u201cHe peacefully gave up to law enforcement who had surrounded the house.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty obvious over the last six weeks to remain a fugitive that long, he had assistance, he had help,\u201d Hodges said.",
      "Authorities had recently investigated social media posts by a man who identified himself as Massey and earlier this month raided a New Orleans home where they believed the videos were produced but did not find him.",
      "\u201cGreat work by all our law enforcement partners who have been working so hard for this outcome,\u201d Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill said after Massey's capture Friday. \u201cOne more to go!\u201d",
      "Authorities are still searching for convicted murderer Derrick Groves. Police previously captured the other eight escapees following the May 16 jailbreak, one of the largest in recent U.S. history. Authorities said the men yanked open a faulty cell door inside the New Orleans jail, squeezed through a hole behind a toilet, scaled a barbed-wire fence and fled into the dark.",
      "The men's absence wasn\u2019t discovered until a morning headcount, hours after they bolted for freedom. Authorities found a message drawn around the hole the men used to escape: an arrow pointing at the gap and the words \u201cTo Easy LoL.\u201d",
      "Officials have pointed to multiple security lapses in the jail, but authorities remain adamant that the men also had likely had help. A maintenance worker at the jail was arrested for allegedly helping the men escape by turning off the water to the toilet where the hole was cut behind. His lawyer says he has denied knowingly aiding them.",
      "Massey faced charges of rape, kidnapping, domestic violence involving strangulation and violation of a protective order, authorities in nearby St. Tammany Parish said. In Orleans Parish, he faced charges of motor vehicle theft and domestic battery.",
      "Murrill said Massey will face additional charges for his role in the escape.",
      "A woman police identified as being in an on-again, off-again relationship with Massey was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice and as a principal to aggravated escape, court records show. Authorities said the woman knew of Massey\u2019s escape plans beforehand, communicated with him afterward and misled authorities.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge on Friday struck down another of President Donald Trump's executive orders targeting law firms.",
      "U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order against the firm of Susman Godfrey was unconstitutional and must be permanently blocked.",
      "The order was the latest ruling to reject Trump's efforts to punish law firms for legal work he does not like and for employing attorneys he perceives as his adversaries. Susman Godfrey suggested that it had drawn Trump's ire at least in part because it represented Dominion Voting Systems in the voting machine company's defamation lawsuit against Fox News over false claims surrounding the 2020 presidential election. The suit ended in a massive settlement.",
      "Other judges in recent weeks have blocked similar orders against the firms of Jenner & Block, Perkins Coie and WilmerHale. The orders have sought to impose similar sanctions, including the suspension of security clearances of attorneys and the restriction of access to federal buildings.",
      "\u201cThe order was one in a series attacking firms that had taken positions with which President Trump disagreed. In the ensuing months, every court to have considered a challenge to one of these orders has found grave constitutional violations and permanently enjoined enforcement of the order in full,\" AliKhan wrote. \u201cToday, this court follows suit, concluding that the order targeting Susman violates the U.S. Constitution and must be permanently enjoined.\u201d",
      "In a statement, the firm called the ruling \u201ca resounding victory for the rule of law and the right of every American to be represented by legal counsel without fear of retaliation.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe applaud the Court for declaring the administration\u2019s order unconstitutional. Our firm is committed to the rule of law and to protecting the rights of our clients without regard to their political or other beliefs. Susman Godfrey\u2019s lawyers and staff live these values every day,\u201d the statement said.",

      "A federal appeals court is staying a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with dismantling the U.S. Institute of Peace",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court panel on Friday stayed a lower court ruling that blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with dismantling the U.S. Institute of Peace, an organization taken over in March by the Department of Government Efficiency, then led by Elon Musk.",
      "The three-judge panel with the U.S. Appeals Court for the District of Columbia Circuit issued the stay, saying the Trump administration's appeal of U.S. District Court Judge Beryl Howell's opinion would likely succeed on the merits. The stay added that the president would face \u201cirreparable harm from not being able to fully exercise his executive powers.\u201d",
      "In filings with the higher court supporting its request for an appeal and a stay of Howell\u2019s order, the government argued that \u201cas evidenced by its programmatic, grant making and peacebuilding activities, USIP\u201d was exercising \u201cconsiderable executive power.\u201d The filings also went on to explain the board members are \u201csubject to the president\u2019s at-will removal authority.\u201d",
      "In issuing the stay, the appeals court agreed and said the nonprofit think tank that focuses on peace initiatives is engaged in activities that fall under the purview of the executive branch.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s decision is a great victory for the American taxpayer. As we have said time and again, the President has the right to manage entities within the Executive Branch \u2014 including the so-called \u2018Institute of Peace,\u2019 which cost taxpayers over $50 million per year while failing to deliver peace,\u201d said White House spokesperson Anna Kelly. \u201cThe President looks forward to continuing to implement his government efficiency agenda.\u201d",
      "The appeal's court action is the latest turn in the government's shutdown of the USIP, which had been turned back over to the organization's board and acting president following Howell's May 19 ruling. It also places the staff's attempt at restarting its operations in limbo.",
      "President Donald Trump issued the executive order in February that targeted the institute and three other agencies for closure in an effort to deliver on campaign promises to shrink the size of the federal government. The first attempt by DOGE to take over the headquarters led to a standoff. Members of Musk\u2019s DOGE group returned days later with the FBI and Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police to help them gain entry.",
      "The institute and many of its board members sued the Trump administration March 18, seeking to prevent their removal and to prevent DOGE from taking over its operations. The firing of the board was followed by a Friday night mass firing by email on March 28, which threw the workforce into turmoil. DOGE transferred the administrative oversight of the organization\u2019s headquarters and assets to the General Services Administration that weekend.",
      "Howell, in a lengthy opinion in May, reversed the action when she determined the organization was not part of the executive branch and therefore Trump did not have authority to fire its board and acting president. She ruled that all subsequent actions, including the firing of most of the staff, the cessation of operations and the takeover of its headquarters and assets, were illegal as well.",
      "Howell denied a government request for a stay of her opinion while the government appeals, a move that led acting president George Moose and others to reclaim the headquarters and begin trying to ramp USIP's operations back up. Those efforts have been slow going, with much of the staff still furloughed and operations in parts of the world shut down.",
      "It was unclear Friday if there would be another change of hands of the headquarters.",
      "A press statement from the organization said \u201cwe will continue to fight for USIP\u2019s right to fulfill its commitment to our congressional mandate and to control USIP\u2019s headquarters, funds, and operations to the fullest extent of the law. We remain confident we will prevail in this case and we look forward to continuing our critical work both at our headquarters in Washington, DC and in conflict zones around the world.\"",

      "A newly filed class action lawsuit in New Hampshire seeks to block changes to an out-of-court settlement fund for victims of child abuse at the state's youth detention center",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- Lawyers representing hundreds of men and woman who claim they were abused at New Hampshire\u2019s youth detention center filed a class action lawsuit Friday seeking to prevent the independent administrator of the state\u2019s settlement fund for victims from being replaced with a political appointee.",
      "Lawmakers created the settlement fund in 2022, pitching it as a \u201cvictim-centered\u201d and \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d alternative to litigation that would be run by a neutral administrator appointed by the state Supreme Court. But the Republican-led Legislature changed that process through last-minute additions to the state budget approved Thursday and signed into law by Gov. Kelly Ayotte on Friday.",
      "Under the new provisions taking effect July 1, the governor will have the authority to hire and fire the fund's administrator, and the attorney general \u2014 also a political appointee \u2014 would have veto power over settlement awards.",
      "In affidavits filed with their complaint, the lead plaintiffs said the change amounts to a bait and switch that reignited the skepticism they initially felt about the settlement process but tried to put aside.",
      "\u201cI never would have shared the full story of what happened to me if I did not think I would be heard by someone impartial,\u201d said a woman identified only as Jane Doe, who said she ran away from home to escape sexual abuse only to be further abused in state custody.",
      "\u201cI feel incredibly betrayed by the state\u2019s actions, but this is just the latest in a long list of betrayals by the state, so maybe I should not be surprised,\u201d she said. \u201cThis also makes me wonder whether the state will next betray the promise of confidentiality, because it seems like their word does not mean anything to them.\u201d",
      "Another plaintiff, Andrew Foley, described being diagnosed with PTSD, not from his time as a combat soldier in Iraq but from the physical and sexual abuse he suffered as a child.",
      "\u201cAs I understand it, the State will now decide for itself how much my claim is worth. That is the opposite of a fair process,\u201d his affidavit said. \u201cAs I always believed, the state cannot be trusted.\u201d",
      "Neither Ayotte nor Attorney General John Formella responded to requests for comment Friday.",
      "More than 1,300 people have sued since 2020 alleging that they were physically or sexually abused in state custody as children, most of them at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester.",
      "Only one case has gone to trial, resulting in a $38 million verdict, though the state is trying to slash it to $475,000. Two other cases have been settled for $10 million and $4.5 million.",
      "The state also has brought criminal charges against former workers, with two convictions and two mistrials so far.",
      "Many of the alleged victims put their lawsuits on hold and applied to the settlement fund, which caps payouts at $2.5 million. As of March 31, 296 cases had been settled, with an average award of $543,000, according to the most recently available statistics.",
      "The lawsuit filed Friday seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent the governor from firing the current administrator, former state Supreme Court Chief Justice John Broderick.",

      "Between the start of the new administration and mid-May, judges issued roughly 40 nationwide injunctions against the White House on topics including federal funding, elections rules and diversity and equity considerations. Attorneys involved in some of those cases are vowing to keep fighting, noting the high court left open other legal paths that could have broad nationwide effect.",
      "Here's a look at some of the decisions that could be impacted:",
      "Multiple federal judges have issued nationwide injunctions blocking President Donald Trump's order denying citizenship to U.S.-born children of people who are in the country illegally or temporarily. The high court's decision Friday came in a lawsuit over that order, but the justices left unclear whether the restrictions on birthright citizenship could soon take effect in parts of the country.",
      "Opponents went back to court within hours of the opinion, using a legal path the court left open to file class-action lawsuits that could have nationwide effect.",
      "On June 13, U.S. District Judge Denise J. Casper in Massachusetts blocked Trump\u2019s attempt to overhaul elections in the U.S. An executive order the Republican president issued in March sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline.",
      "California was one of the plaintiffs in that suit. The office of the state's attorney general, Rob Bonta, said in an email it was assessing the effect of Friday's Supreme Court decision on all of the state's litigation.",
      "A federal judge in California in April blocked the administration from cutting off funding for legal representation for unaccompanied migrant children. The administration has appealed.",
      "U.S. District Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin in San Francisco said there was \u201cno practical way\u201d to limit the scope of the injunction by party or by geography.",
      "\u201cIndeed, as discussed with the Government\u2019s declarants at the preliminary injunction hearing, there exists only one contract for the provision of the subject funding, and it applies to direct legal services nationwide,\u201d Martinez-Olguin wrote.",
      "Plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Adina Appelbaum, program director for the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, said she didn't think the Supreme Court\u2019s decision would significantly affect her case.",
      "But she blasted it, saying the high court had \u201cturned its back on its role to protect the people,\u201d including immigrants.",
      "A federal judge in February largely blocked sweeping executive orders that sought to end government support for programs promoting diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson in Baltimore granted a preliminary injunction preventing the administration from terminating or changing federal contracts it considers equity-related.",
      "An appeals court later put the decision on hold. Attorneys for the group Democracy Forward represented plaintiffs in the case.",
      "The group's president and CEO, Skye Perryman, said she was disappointed by the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, calling it another barrier to seeking relief in court. But she also said it was limited and could keep at least some decisions blocking the Trump administration in place.",
      "A federal judge in February stopped the administration from withholding federal funds from health care facilities that provide gender-affirming care to patients under the age of 19.",
      "Explaining his reasoning for a nationwide injunction, U.S. District Judge Brendan Abell Hurson in Maryland said a \u201cpiecemeal approach is not appropriate in this case.\u201d",
      "\u201cSignificant confusion would result from preventing agencies from conditioning funding on certain medical institutions, while allowing conditional funding to persist as to other medical institutions,\u201d he wrote.",
      "An appeal in the case was on hold as the Supreme Court considered similar issues about minors and transgender health care. The high court last week upheld a Tennessee law banning key health care treatments for transgender youth.",
      "Omar Gonzalez-Pagan, senior counsel for the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund Inc., was one of the attorneys who secured Hurson's ruling. He said the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers were still evaluating the possible impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, but he believed the high court recognized that \u201csystematic, universal relief is sometimes appropriate.\u201d",
      "In May, a judge in Rhode Island blocked an executive order that sought to dismantle federal agencies supporting libraries, museums, minority businesses and parties in labor disputes.",
      "The administration has appealed.",
      "Rhode Island was a plaintiff in the lawsuit. The state's attorney general, Peter F. Neronha, said in a statement Friday he would \"continue to pull every available legal lever to ensure that Americans, all Americans, are protected from the progressively dangerous whims of this President.\u201d",

      "Democratic efforts in the Senate to prevent President Donald Trump from further escalating with Iran have fallen short",
      "WASHINGTON -- Democratic efforts in the Senate to prevent President Donald Trump from further escalating with Iran fell short Friday, with Republicans blocking a resolution that marked Congress\u2019 first attempt to reassert its war powers following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "The resolution, authored by Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, aimed to affirm that Trump should seek authorization from Congress before launching more military action against Iran. Asked Friday if he would bomb Iranian nuclear sites again if he deemed necessary, Trump said, \u201cSure, without question.\u201d",
      "The measure was defeated in a 53-47 vote in the Republican-held Senate. One Democrat, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, joined Republicans in opposition, while Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky was the only Republican to vote in favor.",
      "Most Republicans have said Iran posed an imminent threat that required decisive action from Trump, and they backed his decision to bomb three Iranian nuclear sites last weekend without seeking congressional approval.",
      "\u201cOf course, we can debate the scope and strategy of our military engagements,\u201d said Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn. \u201cBut we must not shackle our president in the middle of a crisis when lives are on the line.\u201d",
      "Democrats cast doubt on that justification, arguing the president should have come to Congress first. They also said the president did not update them adequately, with Congress' first briefings taking place Thursday.",
      "\u201cThe idea is this: We shouldn\u2019t send our sons and daughters into war unless there\u2019s a political consensus that this is a good idea, this is a national interest,\u201d Kaine said in a Thursday interview with The Associated Press. The resolution, Kaine said, wasn't aimed at restricting the president\u2019s ability to defend against a threat, but that \"if it\u2019s offense, let\u2019s really make sure we\u2019re making the right decision.\u201d",
      "In a statement following Friday's vote, Kaine said he was \u201cdisappointed that many of my colleagues are not willing to stand up and say Congress\" should be a part of a decision to go to war.",
      "Democrats' argument for backing the resolution centered on the War Powers Resolution, passed in the early 1970s, which requires the president \u201cin every possible instance\u201d to \u201cconsult with Congress before introducing United States Armed Forces.\u201d",
      "Speaking on the Senate floor ahead of Friday's vote, Paul said he would back the resolution, saying that \u201cdespite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran's nuclear aspirations,\u201d said Paul.",
      "Trump is just the latest in a line of presidents to test the limits of the resolution \u2014 though he\u2019s done so at a time when he\u2019s often bristling at the nation's checks and balances.",
      "Trump on Monday sent a letter to Congress \u2014 as required by the War Powers Resolution \u2014 that said strikes on Iran over the weekend were \u201climited in scope and purpose\u201d and \u201cdesigned to minimize casualties, deter future attacks and limit the risk of escalation.\u201d",
      "But following classified briefings with top White House officials this week, some lawmakers remain skeptical about how imminent the threat truly was.",
      "\u201cThere was no imminent threat to the United States,\u201d said Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, after Friday\u2019s classified briefings.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always an Iranian threat to the world. But, I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago,\u201d Himes said.",
      "Despite Democratic skepticism, nearly all Republicans applauded Trump\u2019s decision to strike Iran. And for GOP senators, supporting the resolution would have meant rebuking the president at the same time they\u2019re working to pass his major legislative package.",
      "Kaine proposed a similar resolution in 2020 aimed at limiting Trump\u2019s authority to launch military operations against Iran. Among the eight Republicans who joined Democrats in approving the resolution was Indiana Sen. Todd Young.",
      "After Thursday\u2019s classified briefing for the Senate, Young said he was \u201cconfident that Iran was prepared to pose a significant threat\u201d and that, given Trump\u2019s stated goal of no further escalation, \u201cI do not believe this resolution is necessary at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cShould the Administration\u2019s posture change or events dictate the consideration of additional American military action, Congress should be consulted so we can best support those efforts and weigh in on behalf of our constituents,\u201d Young said in a statement.",
      "Trump has said that a ceasefire between Israel and Iran is now in place. But he and Ayatollah Ali Khamenei have verbally sparred in recent days, with the ayatollah warning the U.S. not to launch future strikes on Iran.",
      "White House officials have said they expect to restart talks soon with Iran, though nothing has been scheduled.",

      "The Supreme Court delivered significant victories for President Donald Trump in its term that ended Friday",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court has been very good to President Donald Trump lately.",
      "Even before he won a new term in the White House, the court eliminated any doubt about whether Trump could appear on presidential ballots, then effectively spared him from having to stand trial before the 2024 election on criminal charges he tried to overturn the 2020 election. That same ruling spelled out a robust view of presidential power that may well have emboldened Trump's aggressive approach in his second term.",
      "In the five months since Trump's inauguration, the court has been largely deferential to presidential actions, culminating in Friday's decision to limit the authority of federal judges who have sought to block Trump initiatives through nationwide court orders.",
      "The decisions from a court that includes three justices Trump appointed during his first term have provoked a series of scathing dissents from liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson. They accuse the conservative supermajority of kowtowing to the president and putting the American system of government \u201cin grave jeopardy,\u201d as Jackson wrote Friday.",
      "Justice Amy Coney Barrett, author of the opinion limiting nationwide injunctions, responded to Jackson's \u201cstartling line of attack\u201d by noting that she \u201cdecries an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary.\u201d",
      "To be sure, the court has not ruled uniformly for Trump, including by indefinitely stopping deportations to a notorious prison in El Salvador without giving people a reasonable chance to object.",
      "But Trump's victories have dwarfed his losses.",
      "Here are some takeaways from the Supreme Court's term:",
      "That\u2019s where the court deals with cases that are still in their early stages, most often intervening to say whether a judge's order should be in effect while the case proceeds through the courts.",
      "While preliminary, the justices' decisions can signal where they eventually will come out in the end, months or years from now. Emergency orders are generally overshadowed by decisions the justices issued in the cases they heard arguments between last fall and the spring.",
      "Almost since the beginning of Trump\u2019s second term, the court\u2019s emergency docket has been packed with appeals from his administration. For a while, the justices were being asked to weigh in almost once a week as Trump pushed to lift lower court orders slowing his ambitious conservative agenda.",
      "Trump scored a series of wins on issues ranging from the revocation of temporary legal protections for immigrants to Elon Musk\u2019s dramatic cost cutting at the Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "And that was before Friday's decision on nationwide injunctions, court orders that prevent a policy from taking effect anywhere.",
      "Many of the recent orders are in line with the conservatives' robust view of executive power.",
      "The three liberal justices dissented from each of three cases involving transgender rights or LGBTQ issues more generally.",
      "Trump has moved aggressively to roll back the rights of transgender people and the court has rebuffed attempts to stop him.",
      "In another emergency appeal, the court\u2019s conservatives allowed a ban to take effect on transgender members of the military, even after lower courts had found the policy unconstitutional.",
      "In mid-June, Roberts wrote the opinion for a conservative majority that upheld Tennessee\u2019s ban on certain medical treatment for transgender youth, rejecting arguments that it amounted to unconstitutional discrimination. The decision probably will affect a range of other pending court cases on transgender issues, including those involving access to health care, participation on sports teams and gender markers on birth certificates.",
      "On the final day of decisions, the justices ruled in favor of Maryland parents with religious objections who don\u2019t want their children exposed to public school lessons using LGBTQ storybooks. The case was about religious freedom, Justice Samuel Alito wrote for the majority. Sotomayor wrote in dissent that the decision \u201cthreatens the very essence of public education.\u201d",
      "In 2008, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the court\u2019s decision in favor of Guantanamo Bay detainees \u201cwill almost certainly cause more Americans to be killed.\u201d That opinion was written in an era when conservatives were sometimes on the losing end of the term's biggest cases.",
      "Times have changed, as has the tilt of the court.",
      "\u201cIt is important to recognize that the Executive\u2019s bid to vanquish so-called \u2018universal injunctions\u2019 is, at bottom, a request for this court\u2019s permission to engage in unlawful behavior,\u201d Jackson wrote Friday.",
      "Objecting to the court's order in yet another emergency appeal to allow the resumption of quick deportations to third countries, Sotomayor wrote that her conservative colleagues were \u201crewarding lawlessness.\u201d",
      "Sotomayor also dissented from the transgender health care decision. \u201cIt also authorizes, without second thought, untold harm to transgender children and the parents and families who love them,\u201d she wrote.",
      "The court left for its long summer break without any retirements, despite talk that one of older conservative justices, 77-year-old Clarence Thomas or 75-year-old Samuel Alito, might step aside so that Trump could keep a conservative in their seats for the next few decades.",
      "But with Republicans in control of the Senate at least through the end of 2026, a justice could retire a year from now with sufficient time to have his replacement confirmed.",
      "Thomas, the longest-serving of the current justices, has just under three years to go until he would become the longest-serving justice in U.S. history. The record is held by William O. Douglas, whose 36-year tenure began during FDR's presidency in 1939 and ended when Gerald Ford was in the White House, in 1975.",

      "CHIMNEY ROCK, N.C. -- An iconic tourist attraction in an area of western North Carolina among the hardest hit by Hurricane Helene reopened to the public on Friday, nine months after the storm brought historic flooding, destruction and loss of life.",
      "North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein and other officials attended a reopening ceremony at Chimney Rock State Park, which is about 25 miles (40.2 kilometers) southeast of Asheville. The main portion of the park will now be open again from Fridays to Mondays to visitors who make reservations, Stein's office said.",
      "Stein also signed into law before the ceremony\u2019s crowd another state Helene recovery bill finalized by the General Assembly on Thursday that sends $700 million to the state's Helene relief fund and appropriates $500 million of that. And Stein announced a new tourism campaign to encourage travel and spending in the North Carolina mountains.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s reopening is a huge achievement,\u201d Stein told attendees. \u201cChimney Rock is just one of the many places that make western North Carolina unforgettable.\u201d",
      "Last September's storm swept away the ornate stone and concrete bridge across the Broad River to reach the portion of the park that contains the 315-foot (96-meter) high geological formation that's shaped in keeping with the park's name. The park, which also features hiking trails and other amenities, usually attracts 400,000 people annually.",
      "A road had to be paved and a temporary bridge made from old railroad cars was laid over the river.",
      "The reopening provides needed encouragement to those in adjoining Chimney Rock Village, where a third of the hamlet's businesses were destroyed as river waters removed buildings from their foundations.",
      "\u201cIt almost wiped us off the map,\u201d village Mayor Peter O\u2019Leary said on Friday. \u201cThe village knew one thing that was of utmost importance to our survival. We had to have Chimney Rock State Park open again.\u201d Some village businesses are reopening.",
      "Before Friday's bill signing, the General Assembly already had appropriated or reallocated more than $1.6 billion for Helene recovery.",
      "The new Helene law is the fifth relief package approved by the Republican-controlled General Assembly since last fall.

      "\u201cWe have a lot of work to do, but it\u2019s also good to take stock and recognize that today is a good day,\u201d Stein said. The governor is also seeking more federal funds for Helene recovery beyond the billions already received by the state and by those harmed by the storm.",
      "State officials say the storm caused more than 100 deaths in North Carolina and generated roughly $60 billion in damages and needs.",

    "story": [
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0was portrayed in his lawyer's closing argument on Friday as the victim of an overzealous prosecution that tried to turn the recreational use of drugs and a swinger lifestyle into a racketeering conspiracy that could put the music mogul behind bars for life.",
      "Attorney Marc Agnifilo mocked the government's case against Combs and belittled the agents who seized hundreds of bottles of Astroglide lubricant and baby oil at his properties as he began his four-hour presentation Friday in a New York courtroom.",
      "\"Way to go, fellas,\" he said of the agents.",
      "He said prosecutors had \"badly exaggerated\" evidence of a swinger lifestyle and threesomes to combine it with recreational drug use and call it a racketeering conspiracy.",
      "\"He did not do the things he's charged with. He didn't do racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking,\" the lawyer said.",
      "Agnifilo said of Combs: \"He sits there innocent. Return him to his family who have been waiting for him.\"",
      "Agnifilo called Combs' prosecution a \"fake trial\" and ridiculed the notion that he engaged in racketeering. \"Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me?\" Agnifilo asked. \"Did any witness get on that witness stand and say yes, I was part of a racketeering enterprise \u2014 I engaged in racketeering?\" No, Agnifilo argued, telling jurors that those accusations were a figment of the prosecution's imagination.",
      "The lawyer argued prosecutors had invaded Combs' most intimate personal affairs, telling jurors: \"Where's the crime scene? It's your sex life.\"",
      "Agnifilo also argued there's another factor at play in the allegations that women have lobbed against Combs: the prospect of draining him of his wealth through lawsuits.",
      "\"This isn't about crime. It's about money. This is about money,\" Agnifilo said.",
      "In the prosecution's rebuttal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey said Agnifilo had spent \"a whole lot of energy\" trying to distract from Combs' \"inexcusable behavior.\"",
      "\"Make no mistake,\" Comey told jurors, \"this trial was about how in Sean Combs' world, 'no' was never an option.\"",
      "In his closing argument, Agnifilo reiterated that the defense \"owns\" the fact that Combs was violent but argued that behavior does not justify the grave charges against him.",
      "Combs and R&B singer\u00a0Cassie Ventura Fine\u00a0had a \"loving, beautiful relationship,\" albeit a \"complicated\" one, Agnifilo said. \"If racketeering conspiracy had an opposite, it would be their relationship,\" Agnifilo said. \"They were deeply in love with each other.\"",
      "In her rebuttal, Comey said, \"Being a domestic abuser is not a defense to sex trafficking.\"",
      "Jurors are expected to begin deliberating on Monday.",
      "Combs' family, including six of his children and his mother, were in the audience for the defense's closing, which took place a day after the prosecution made its closing arguments Thursday \u2014 after calling on 34 witnesses over the course of seven weeks. Combs' ex-girlfriend, Ventura Fine, and rapper\u00a0Kid Cudi, were among those who testified.",
      "The trial of Combs, 55, began on May 12. Prosecutors allege he relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in \u2014 or attempted to engage in \u2014 \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "Combs has denied the allegations against him and\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts. If convicted, he could face up to life in prison.",
      "Combs has been present at the trial but told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian earlier this week that he decided not to testify.",
      "\"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it,\" he said.",
      "The defense\u00a0rested\u00a0on Tuesday after presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. It didn't call any witnesses.",
      "Combs' lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "In federal prosecutors' closing arguments, Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury that Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",

      "The 43-year-old artist said she is currently writing new material and finding the creative process particularly rewarding.",
      "\"I'm finding it such a flow right now, which is so cool,\" she said. \"Every writer gets writer's block sometimes, so when you're in a flow, you're like\u2014it's a download, in a stream.\"",

    "story": [
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \"Mission: Impossible\" and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan.",
      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996's first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand's Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Schifrin's background and his other prolific work",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band.",
      "Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie's quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \"Gillespiana.\"",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California's Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \"Christmas in Vienna\" in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event's 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",
      "In addition to his sons, he's survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "For British indie pop icon MARINA, the most thrilling part of writing a record is when she finally nails what it's about.",
      "\"I was like, it's 'Princess of Power' \u2026 and it spells 'pop.' It's like, this is meant to be,\" MARINA said.",
      "Her sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" comes after the artist \u2014 born Marina Diamandis \u2014 recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome while rebuilding her relationship with music and her identity.",
      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",
      "Although she admitted it's \"somewhat frustrating\" when music doesn't reach mainstream success, her dedicated fanbase never fails to find it.",
      "\"I always want people to choose to love my music. I don't want to shove it in anyone's face,\" she said.",
      "The origins of MARINA's journey",
      "The daughter of a Welsh mother and Greek father, MARINA moved from her hometown of Abergavenny, Wales, to London at 19. She was initially embarrassed to sing in public \u2014 but music felt like an \"innate calling.\"",
      "She overcame her stage fright \"painfully\" by going to open mic nights alone.",
      "\"I was like, if I'm bad, I need no one I know to see me be bad, which you can't do anymore, 'cause everyone's filming everything,\" she said, laughing.",
      "She launched her career with her 2010 debut \"The Family Jewels,\" then going by Marina and the Diamonds, followed by 2012's \"Electra Heart,\" which reached No. 1 on British charts.\u00a0But by 2016, success felt suffocating.",
      "\"And I just suddenly felt really trapped,\" she said. \"I felt like my identity was glued to my artist's identity. I just suddenly, like wanted out.\"",
      "Discovering health issues",
      "That same year, MARINA began experiencing mysterious symptoms that would later be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.",
      "\"The main symptom actually was buzzing all over,\" she explained. \"And it always started in my feet then it would basically go all the way up my body \u2026 like my face would basically be throbbing. Like my whole body would feel like it was ringing.\"",
      "It took six years to understand the condition was connected to her nervous system. Breathwork ultimately provided relief.",
      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",
      "That transformation represents more than recovery, it's a reclamation of her power.",

    "story": [
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

    "summary": "His mother is a member of the Kennedy clan; his father was the Terminator. Now, actor Patrick Schwarzenegger, a standout in the HBO Max series \"The White Lotus,\" talks about how he chose to pursue a career while carrying the weight of a famous Hollywood name.",
    "story": [
      "\"Every time I'm out in, like, nature, that's kind of where I like to do my prayers or gratitude list,\" said Patrick Schwarzenegger. These days he is counting his blessings, even though the role he was recently blessed with is anything but reverent. He plays the much-talked-about (and much-hated) Saxon Ratliff, the eldest son of a wealthy family visiting Thailand, in the latest incarnation of HBO's \"The White Lotus.\"",
      "Saxon is a chiseled car crash \u2013 a sex-obsessed, protein shake-chugging bro who is so irredeemably into his own masculinity, he offends even his own sister. How do you even audition for a part like that?",
      "Schwarzenegger says he was only given a short sentence describing Saxon's excitable personality: \"The wording was that ''He flirted with anything.' So, I just took the first few seconds and just kind of, you know, stared at the camera in a loving way.\"",
      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",
      "WATCH: \"The White Lotus\" clip: Saxon and TimothyIn this scene, Saxon Ratliff (Patrick Schwarzenegger) demands to know from his dad, Timothy (Jason Isaacs)\u00a0 whether everything is OK at the office. [Spoiler alert: Everything is NOT OK at the office.]",
      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",

    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

    "summary": "Lyn Redwood, who spread debunked claims about vaccines, will be in the CDC's Immunization Safety Office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring Lyn Redwood, a nurse and the former head of a group critics have denounced as anti-vaccine, to work in its vaccine safety office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",
      "\"I was so naive. I really thought that they would take immediate action, and that they would stop these exposures,\" she said.",

      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",
      "In its release, Novo Nordisk said a company investigation showed that the ingredients in knock-off drugs sold by telehealth entities and compounding pharmacies are manufactured by foreign suppliers in China and that a large share of the drugs were never inspected by the FDA.",

      "Novo Nordisk will continue to sell Wegovy on other telehealth platforms that \"share our commitment to patient safety,\" said Dave Moore, executive vice president at Novo Nordisk, in the company's\u00a0statement. Among the telehealth companies Novo Nordisk partners with are LifeMD and Ro.",

    "summary": "Tens of millions of Americans are unable to save for retirement through their jobs. \"That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis,\" one expert says.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

      "President Trump says he's \"terminating all discussions on trade with Canada, effective immediately,\" after Canada announced a digital services tax on large foreign and domestic technology companies.",
      "Posting on Truth Social\u00a0on Friday afternoon, the president said the U.S. will let Canada know what their tariff rate will be in the next week. The trade talks blowup comes only a week after the president met with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the Group of Seven\u00a0economic summit in Alberta.",
      "\"We have just been informed that Canada, a very difficult Country to TRADE with, including the fact that they have charged our Farmers as much as 400% Tariffs, for years, on Dairy Products, has just announced that they are putting a Digital Services Tax on our American Technology Companies, which is a direct and blatant attack on our Country,\" the president wrote. \"They are obviously copying the European Union, which has done the same thing, and is currently under discussion with us, also. Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.\"",
      "Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year, will hit tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Meta and Uber with a 3% tax on revenue from users in Canada. The Associated Press reports the retroactive tax bill is expected to cost U.S. companies $2 billion, due at the end of June.",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 15:13:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Economists warned that a barrage of new U.S. tariffs could trigger a renewed bout of inflation. So why aren't prices surging?",
    "story": [
      "Despite concerns earlier this year that President Trump's tariffs would cause a renewed bout of inflation, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have remained relatively stable.",
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, rose 2.3% in May, modestly above the central bank's 2% annual target. The May Consumer Price Index rose at an annual rate of 2.4%, cooler than economists expected.",
      "The muted inflation data reflects short-term steps taken by some companies to offset the tariff impact, such as pre-ordering inventory, absorbing the cost of some tariffs to cushion consumers from price hikes, and leveraging loopholes to delay or lower duty payments, economists say.",
      "\"Many businesses have been creative and savvy in using different means to buffer the initial shock,\" EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That doesn't mean consumers and businesses, who were battered by the highest inflation in decades during the pandemic, are out of the woods. Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, thinks prices are likely to rise as tariffs gradually push up import costs in the second half of the year.",
      "\"We still think in next few months we'll continue to see the impact of the new trade policies on price levels, and they should translate into higher inflation,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Here are three reasons why tariffs haven't driven up inflation as much as many economists expected, at least for now.",
      "Aggressive \"front-loading\"",
      "After the Trump administration announced a range of tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico and dozens of other countries earlier this year, many companies scrambled to stock up, or front-load, on products, parts and other imports to\u00a0avoid incurring added tariff costs.",
      "\"They tried to front-run the imposition of the duties by importing rapidly,\" Daco said. \"They bought goods they needed and stocked them, so that was the first line of defense against the tariffs.\"",
      "Much of that extra inventory remains in warehouses or on store shelves, allowing importers to delay price hikes.",
      "\"Lots of retailers pre-ordered inventory before the tariffs went into effect, so the inventory they're selling has not been marked up yet,\" Goldberg said.",
      "Waiting for clarity",
      "Some businesses facing higher tariffs are choosing to hold off on passing any cost increases through to consumers\u00a0as they wait for the fog around U.S. trade policy to lift.",
      "The Trump administration in April froze most of its tariffs for 90 days to allow time for negotiations, with that pause due to expire on July 9. And after announcing tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports earlier this year, Mr. Trump and Chinese officials on Thursday said the two countries have agreed on the framework for a trade deal.",
      "\"We have had literally dozens of changes in tariff policy in the last five months. In that highly uncertain environment, companies that sell items that are subject to tariff may be cautious about raising prices immediately,\" Charley Ballard, professor of economics emeritus at Michigan State University, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Companies often refrain from raising prices to avoid scaring away consumers and losing market share to competitors.",
      "Added Daco: \"Essentially, some business decided to not immediately pass on the cost. They said, 'Let's see if we can hold out for a month, delay some imports, use the inventory on hand and be creative in terms of our broader pricing strategy'.\"",
      "Although tariffs are paid by importers, which typically pass those costs on to consumers, some foreign exporters have also been willing to take a hit.",
      "Lower tariff costs",
      "Although Mr. Trump has announced sky-high tariff rates, the actual duties collected at the U.S. border so far are lower than the official rates. That's because some importers have been able to skirt the levies by storing goods in so-called bonded warehouses or foreign trade zones.",
      "Businesses can use bonded warehouses, which are usually located near major commercial ports, to temporarily store goods, components and other inputs without immediately having to pay tariffs or taxes.",
      "\"If you make use of a warehouse or so-called foreign trade zone, you are able to delay the payment of tariffs until these goods are put into commerce,\" Daco said. \"So it's a free-trade zone, or imaginary area that is not subject to tariffs.\"",
      "Additionally, the U.S. has implemented a number of tariff exemptions and exclusions. In practice, that has resulted in the actual levies on imports often being lower than the nominal rate initially announced by the White House.",
      "As of June, the effective U.S. tariff rate on all imports was around 10%, compared with an official average tariff rate of 15%.",
      "Still, business can't hold the line on price hikes indefinitely if tariffs remain elevated, experts say. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell\u00a0told lawmakers this week\u00a0that tariffs could yet spark higher inflation, likely starting this summer,",
      "\"Part of that is due to the start-stop nature of the tariffs that have been introduced,\" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"For us it's a question of patience more than a mystery as to where it is,\" he added. \"The typical pass-through takes some time. We expect July to be when you start to see it more.\"",

    "story": [
      "The personal consumption expenditures price index, or PCE, inched higher in May, the latest sign that inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target.",
      "Prices rose 2.3% in May compared with a year ago, up from just 2.1% in April, according to the PCE data. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.7% from a year earlier, up from a rate of 2.5% the previous month.",
      "While inflation ticked higher, prices across the U.S. haven't yet shown a major impact from the Trump administration's tariffs. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell cautioned earlier this week that inflation could reignite this summer as the import duties are passed through to consumers.",
      "Consumers also pared their spending last month, marking their first reduction since January, while incomes also dropped, the Commerce Department\u00a0said\u00a0on Friday. The pullback in spending, which dropped 0.1% last month, comes after Americans opened their wallets earlier in the year to buy goods before the tariffs took effect, economists said.",
      "\"While the spending numbers fell slightly and came in below expectations, we would not read too much into these numbers as this weakness is probably primarily just payback from the jump in spending earlier this year as consumers tried to buy goods ahead of the tariffs,\" Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income and portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Incomes dropped after a one-time adjustment to Social Security benefits had boosted payments in March and April. Social Security payments were raised for some retirees who had worked for state and local governments due to the Social Security Fairness Act.",
      "Modest impact from tariffs",
      "The inflation figures suggest that President Trump's broad-based tariffs are still having only a modest effect on prices. The cost of some goods, such as toys and sporting goods, have risen, but those increases have been partly offset by falling prices for new cars, airline fares and apartment rentals, among other items.",
      "On a monthly basis, in fact, inflation was mostly tame. Prices rose just 0.1% in May from April, according to the Commerce Department, the same as the previous month. Core prices climbed 0.2% in May, more than economists expected and above last month's 0.1%.",
      "Economists point to several reasons why Trump's tariffs have yet to accelerate the pace of inflation, as many analysts had expected. Like American consumers, companies imported billions of dollars of goods in the spring before the duties kicked in, and many items currently on store shelves were imported without paying higher levies.",
      "Some businesses are also absorbing higher import costs, cushioning consumers from price hikes.",
      "\"For the moment, there is nothing of consequence to worry about on the inflation side of this report,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told clients in a research note. \"There is, however, an unexpected drop in consumer spending, the first since the pandemic.

      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony expected to take place Friday, according to local media reports.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "Details on the wedding location of have remained under wraps, but Italian papers and Venetian locals predict it will take place Friday on San Giorgio Maggiore. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "The reception is expected to be held on Saturday at Arsenale, a sprawling brick complex and former shipyard that was used from the 12th century until World War I. It's best known today as one of the main venues for the Biennale cultural festivals, which include exhibitions on art, architecture, film, dance, music and theater.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "The event has put a spotlight on the uber-weathly, with local protestors pushing back against the event's extravagance.",
      "\"Venice is not just a pretty picture, a pretty postcard to please the needs and wants of the elite or of mass tourists, but it is an alive city, made of people who want to actually live there,\" Stella Faye, a university researcher from Venice,\u00a0told The Associated Press on Friday.",
      "According to a new Oxfam report, the world's richest 1% have increased their wealth by more than $33.9 trillion since 2015. The report also found that a group of 3,000 billionaires, which includes Bezos, have increased their wealth by $6.5 trillion in real terms since 2015. That's equivalent to 14.6% of global GDP.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion).",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports.",
      "The event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, the Kardashian sisters, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg, President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, The Associated Press reported.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protesters gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",
      "\"We will always respect the right to speak out, but we reject every form of intolerance and prejudice,\" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in Thursday's edition of Italian newspaper Il Foglio Quotidiano. \"No one in Venice can claim the right of deciding who can enter, who can love, who can celebrate.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",

    "summary": "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say. It appears that rare earth minerals are one key part of it.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say.",
      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",
      "\"We're going to have deal after deal after deal,\" Lutnick said.",

      "The S&P 500 has jumped 23% since closing at its 2025 low on April 8. On Thursday, it closed up 9 points, or 0.8%, to 6,141, just three points shy of its record closing high of 6,144 on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also flirted with its previous record of 20,174, set in December 2024, inching up 195 points, or 1%, on Thursday to close at 20,167.",
      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",

      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",

      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

    "story": [
      "Nestle announced on Wednesday that it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by mid-2026.",
      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday that it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers' changing nutritional needs and preferences. \"We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers. As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them,\" Nestle's U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement.",

      "The FTC reached a separate agreement last year under which Epic was fined $275 million over allegations it violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act Rule.",
      "How can I apply for a refund?",

Previously, consumers had until February 14 to file a claim, but the FTC has now extended that deadline to July 9. If you already filed a claim after February 14, no further action is required.",

      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4%, up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate.",
      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",
      "By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure.",
      "Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey.",

      "Health Insurance Plans (AHIP), a trade association that represents the health insurance industry, announced Monday that some of its biggest members are taking steps to streamline \"prior authorization\" \u2014 industry jargon for the process by which health care providers obtain approval from patients' insurance carriers to deliver care.",
      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 08:00:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Now in its sixth month, President Trump's administration has become the antithesis of progress, many LGBTQ Americans say.",
    "story": [
      "In Marsha P. Johnson's final interview before her death in 1992, the activist later recognized as an icon of the movement that preceded LGBTQ rights in the United States explained why she, a transgender woman, championed a cause that often excluded her.",
      "\"I've been walking for gay rights all these years,\" Johnson said, referencing early Pride marches in a conversation that appears in a 2012 documentary about her life. \"Because you never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights.\"",
      "Since then, social and political wins over time grew to encompass everyone represented by the acronym LGBTQ, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. But that's become less true in recent years, as lawmakers in Tennessee, Texas and a number of other states repeatedly pushed legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming care, bathrooms and sports teams for transgender people.",
      "Anti-trans sentiment was central to President Trump's 2024 campaign, LGBTQ advocates say, and it followed him into office. Many of his directives this term have closely mirrored Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda that explicitly prioritizes eroding LGBTQ rights.",
      "A \"divide and conquer\" approach",
      "From health care bans, to sports bans, bathroom bans, a military ban and attempts to erase non-binary gender pronouns from the federal system, Mr. Trump's most conspicuous threats to LGBTQ rights specifically target trans people, a pattern that has drawn accusations of scapegoating from his critics, given that trans people make up an estimated 1% or less of the U.S. population.",
      "LGBTQ advocates also see it as a tactic to sow division in the community.",
      "\"Donald Trump ran for president on an age-old platform of divide and conquer,\" said Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. \"Inside the LGBTQ+ community, Donald Trump ran his campaign saying, I'm not targeting all LGBTQ+ people, just the trans people, and if you sacrifice that community, perhaps you will be spared.\"",
      "While polling data showed most LGBTQ voters didn't choose to elect him, Mr. Trump has gained increasingly loud support from a faction of gay conservatives who disavow the \"radical LGBT left\" and insist his policies aren't at odds with their personal freedoms.",
      "When the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced the upcoming termination of part of its 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to helping LGBTQ youth, the gay conservative group Log Cabin Republicans called related media coverage \"fake news.\"",
      "On TikTok, a small but popular band of conservative gay influencers post videos to similarly defend Mr. Trump's record. \"Rights I've lost in Trump's America as a gay man,\" reads the caption of one of them, followed by an empty list numbered 1 through 5. In the comments section of another, a TikTok user responded to a thread outlining the current administration's anti-LGBTQ actions by saying, \"None of that has anything to do with us being gay.\"",
      "Trump's orders",
      "On Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump declared in his televised address to the American public that \"only two genders,\" male and female, would be recognized going forward by the federal government. He signed an executive order to enforce that within hours of being sworn in.",
      "Titled \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" the wide-ranging order included instructions for the State Department to prohibit trans people from using gender markers that reflect their identities on official documents, like passports, and instead require that those markers align with the document holders' reproductive organs \"at conception.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration's passport policy attacks the foundations of the right to privacy and the freedom for all people to live their lives safely and with dignity,\" said Jessie Rossman, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts, which has made headway in a lawsuit aiming to reverse the new rule, in a statement. \"We will continue to fight to stop this unlawful policy once and for all.\"",
      "Like many of Mr. Trump's executive orders, that one has faced steep challenges in the courts, and legal experts say its long-term applicability is uncertain as some elements contradict the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which codified discrimination protections for all LGBTQ employees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The same conflict exists in Mr. Trump's orders to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, in which he instructed federal departments to \"correct\" what he called a \"misapplication\" of the Bostock ruling in their policies.",
      "Their uncertain futures aside, LGBTQ advocacy and rights groups feel those policies and others have already reaped consequences on the community at large \u2014 \"the predictable result,\" said Wolf, \"of a divide and conquer campaign.\"",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive to end \"radical indoctrination in K-12 schools,\" the Department of Defense banned books with themes involving gender identity, sexual orientation and race from its schools for children in military families, which receive federal funding, according to a separate lawsuit filed by the ACLU. A textbook focused on LGBTQ figures in American history was tossed out under the ban.",
      "Meanwhile, corporations scrambling to comply with anti-DEI orders eliminated or scaled back their partnerships with Pride celebrations around the country after Mr. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center in February forced WorldPride organizers to regroup because events were either canceled or relocated from the venue. And, in May, the Human Rights Campaign issued a memo warning that Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" a \"skinny\" budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, would cut $2.67 billion in federal funding from programs that support LGBTQ people.",
      "Among its most urgent concerns were the administration's plans to significantly downsize public health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention as well as Justice Department programs that investigate anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, in addition to sweeping cuts to resources for the trans community.",
      "Asked where LGBTQ rights stand under the Trump administration, a White House spokesperson pointed to Mr. Trump's past appointments of openly gay judges and officials such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in addition to two initiatives during his first term to decriminalize homosexuality globally and end the HIV epidemic by 2030, although his 2026 budget proposal would hamper that.",
      "\"President Trump's historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people,\" said the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, in a statement. \"The President continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans. The American people voted for a return to common sense, and the President is delivering on every campaign promise supported by 77 million voters and is ushering in our Golden Age.\"",
      "\"An anti-LGBTQ administration\"",
      "In addition to tangible policies, advocates say that attitudes toward LGBTQ people from the nation's highest office are contributing to higher incidences of violence against LGBTQ people and likely foreshadow harms still to come.",
      "\"Overall, it is clearly an anti-LGBTQ administration,\" said Sarah-Kate Ellis, the president and chief operating officer at the LGBTQ media organization GLAAD. \"And I think that they are consistently signaling that they want to roll back all of our hard-won rights.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and those in his orbit have repeatedly cast LGBTQ people and activities in a negative light. While announcing leadership shifts at the Kennedy Center in February, the president penned a social media post that pledged, in capital letters, to ensure the arts forum would no longer host drag shows \"or other anti-American propaganda.\" His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, later said the country needs \"less LGBTQ graduate majors\" in an interview on Fox News criticizing Harvard University.",
      "According to advocates and academics, the administration frequently relies on political strategies to marginalize trans people that have been used against other groups in the past. The term \"groomers,\" for example, is a historically anti-gay trope, and \"gender ideology\" originally demonized feminism.",
      "There were also notable moments of silence from the Trump administration, which did not acknowledge Pride Month, even as a global Pride festival took place for several weeks between May and June in Washington, D.C. LGBTQ people say that wasn't necessarily a surprise after watching their visibility decline in national forums this year, starting with mentions of \"lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" \"gay,\" \"transgender,\" \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" being scrubbed from the White House website the day after Mr. Trump's inauguration, in a flashback to his first term.",
      "References to trans people disappeared around the same time from the website for the Stonewall National Monument, considered the birthplace of gay liberation, in a move that sparked particular outcry. Marcia P. Johnson was among the pioneering trans activists who remain named on the site despite that change.",
      "Where do LGBTQ rights stand in America?",
      "Advocates for LGBTQ rights and others in the community say they're wary of what may come next. Echoing discourse that has persisted online since Mr. Trump's campaign, Ellis said she expects a right-wing push to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, is imminent.",
      "\"Our view on this is that they will continually attack our community and find any way to dismantle our community,\" she said, of the right-wing forces propelling Mr. Trump. \"They've only focused on trans people because they are such a small population and so marginalized. But they will go after our marriages. They will go after our families. It has always been the anti-LGBTQ movement at the center of this.\"",
      "At least nine state legislatures have introduced bills to reverse the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling since Mr. Trump returned to Washington. Earlier this month, the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution that calls for the same. LGBTQ advocates emphasize that marriage equality is settled law, and research from Gallup and GLAAD demonstrate that a vast majority of Americans continue to support it. But some still worry the path to overturning Obergefell could be akin to the one that led to the fall of Roe v. Wade, which kept abortion legal for 50 years before Trump-appointed justices tipped the Supreme Court bench and struck it down.",

Major policy disputes also remained.",
      "Senate Republicans did not release the final version of their bill until late Friday night, giving senators little time to digest it before taking an initial procedural vote that's necessary to move toward final passage.",
      "Mr. Trump has pressured Congress to send him the sprawling package \u2014 which includes tax cuts and funding for his immigration and defense priorities \u2014 by the Fourth of July holiday.",
      "In the bill, Republicans proposed slashing funding for Medicaid, which provides health insurance to low-income individuals and people with disabilities, and food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program \u2014 or food stamps \u2014 to help pay for those priorities.",
      "Over the last week, the Senate parliamentarian determined that some of the most controversial provisions in the package violated a rule that governs the reconciliation process, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending. The rulings directed Republicans to either drop those sections from the package or rewrite them.",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine forced a vote on a resolution he introduced days before the U.S. bombed Iran.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate on Friday voted down an effort to block President Trump from using further military force against Iran, as Democratic anger festers over the lack of details about the\u00a0recent strikes\u00a0on the country's nuclear facilities.",
      "The measure failed in a 47-53 vote, with Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voting with most Democrats in favor of the resolution, and Democratic Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania voting with most Republicans against it.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia introduced the war powers resolution days before the U.S. bombed three locations central to Iran's nuclear program, seeking to force the president to get congressional authorization before entering the conflict between Israel and Iran.",
      "\"The events of this week have demonstrated that war is too big to be consigned to the decisions of any one person,\" Kaine said on the Senate floor ahead of the vote.",
      "Since the measure was introduced, Mr. Trump announced a ceasefire between the adversaries and declared that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" during the 12-day war. On Friday, Mr. Trump said he would \"without question\" consider bombing Iran again if Tehran was enriching uranium to a level that concerned the U.S.",
      "But anger from Democrats, including those who have said that Iran should never be able to obtain a nuclear weapon, has simmered as they say they have been left in the dark about U.S. military actions.",
      "It's led some Democrats to question whether the Trump administration is misleading the public about the strikes, especially after an initial classified assessment found that they set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth called it \"an historically successful attack\" in a contentious press briefing Thursday.",
      "Classified briefings for the Senate and House were originally scheduled for Tuesday, the same day the initial assessment was leaked. Officials briefed senators on Thursday afternoon and House members on Friday.",
      "A White House official said Tuesday the Senate briefing was postponed because of \"evolved circumstances as a result of recent positive developments in the Middle East.\"",
      "After the briefings, some Democrats cast doubt on the administration's characterization of the strikes and questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said the information disclosed in the briefing was \"massively different than what has been told to Congress over the last year, up until a month ago, about both Iranian capabilities and Iranian intent.\"",
      "Crow said he was \"not convinced of that whatsoever\" when asked whether Iranian nuclear facilities had been obliterated.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, has railed against a lack of transparency and said earlier this week the administration had not presented Congress with any evidence that Iran posed an imminent threat requiring immediate military action.",
      "But Jeffries did not go as far as supporting a resolution to impeach Mr. Trump over the bombings. He and more than 120 Democrats voted with all Republicans to kill the measure, which was introduced by Democratic Rep. Al Green of Texas, on Tuesday.",
      "Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also questioned the timing of the strikes.",
      "\"It's pretty clear that there was no imminent threat to the United States,\" Himes said. \"There's always an Iranian threat to the world. But ... I have not seen anything to suggest that the threat from the Iranians was radically different last Saturday than it was two Saturdays ago.\"",
      "Kaine's resolution was one of a handful of similar efforts seeking to curtail further U.S. involvement in Iran, though it's unclear whether any will be successful in a Congress controlled narrowly by Republicans.",
      "Some Republicans who were initially supportive of the resolutions, like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, appear to be backing away from forcing a vote as long as the ceasefire holds and the U.S. does not conduct any further bombings. And House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, called the efforts irrelevant because Iran and Israel agreed to stop the fighting.",
      "\"It's kind of a moot point now, isn't it?\" Johnson said Monday. \"It seems rather silly at this point and I hope they'll acknowledge it as such and put it to bed because it has zero chance of passing anyway.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune told\u00a0The Wall Street Journal this week he believes Mr. Trump acted \"perfectly within his authority\" by striking Iran.",
      "\"I don't think there's any question the president has the authority legally and constitutionally to do what he did,\" the South Dakota Republican said. \"There are always questions around these things, but past presidents and both political parties have similarly acted in circumstances where there've been airstrikes at various places around the world where our national security interests dictated it.\"",
      "The Constitution gives Congress the power to declare war, and most major military conflicts in recent history have been launched under an authorization for the use of military force passed by Congress. But presidents have periodically acted without explicit permission from lawmakers, including during President Bill Clinton's 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia and President Barack Obama's 2011 airstrikes on Libya, the Congressional Research Service notes.",
      "In announcing his support for Kaine's resolution, Paul said Congress was abdicating its constitutional responsibility by allowing a president to act unilaterally and warned that last week's strikes could have unintended consequences.",
      "\"Despite the tactical success of our strikes, they may end up proving to be a strategic failure. It is unclear if this intervention will fully curtail Iran's nuclear aspirations, or, in fact, whether the Iranians may well conclude to double down on their efforts to obtain a nuclear weapon,\" Paul said.",
      "Those opposed to the resolution argued that Mr. Trump acted within his constitutional authority and that the measure would constrain the president's ability to respond quickly to a threat.",
      "In an interview last week with CBS News' Major Garrett, Kaine acknowledged that his resolution could fail but said he wanted his colleagues to be on the record about U.S. involvement in another war.",
      "\"Everyone in the Senate should agree that this is a matter of such gravity and importance that we shouldn't allow war to begin without Congress having a debate in full view of the American public and members of the Senate and House having to go on the record about it,\" he said.",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Nikole  Killion and \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-birthright-citizenship-universal-injunctions/",
    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 21:12:12 -0400",
    "summary": "The court ruled that universal injunctions issued by lower courts likely exceed the authority Congress has granted them.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Supreme Court on Friday limited the use of nationwide injunctions, reining in federal judges' ability to issue sweeping orders that have in recent years stymied implementation of policies from Republican and Democratic presidential administrations alike.",
      "In a widely anticipated decision stemming from President Trump's executive order seeking to end\u00a0birthright citizenship, the high court said that universal orders likely exceed the equitable authority that Congress has granted to the federal courts. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with the liberal justices in dissent.",
      "The court granted the Trump administration request to narrow the reach of the injunctions blocking the president's executive order while proceedings move forward, but \"only to the extent that the injunctions are broader than necessary to provide complete relief\" to plaintiffs who can sue, Barrett wrote. The justices did not address the question of whether Mr. Trump's order is constitutional, and the administration has said agencies have 30 days to issue public guidance about implementation of the policy, allowing time for more challenges to be filed.",
      "\"Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.' But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,\" Barrett wrote. \"When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.\"",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of abdicating its role in protecting the rule of law. She read portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench.",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the president has made a 'solemn mockery' of our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"Rather than stand firm, the court gives way.\"",
      "At a White House news conference following the decision, Mr. Trump praised it as \"a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Universal injunctions and the birthright citizenship case",
      "The court's ruling came in a trio of emergency appeals by the Trump administration arising out of the president's executive order seeking to end the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which means that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to narrow the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's policy nationwide while legal challenges brought by 22 states, immigrants' rights groups and seven individuals moved forward.",
      "But instead of swiftly deciding whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief, the Supreme Court held arguments on whether to restrict the use of nationwide, or universal, injunctions, which are judicial orders that prevent the government from enforcing a policy anywhere in the country and against anyone, including individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship has become intertwined with the administration's battle against nationwide injunctions. These sweeping orders have frustrated both Democratic and Republican presidents seeking to implement their agendas among gridlock in Congress, and the fight over them has been simmering for several years.",
      "The Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued during Mr. Trump's first term and 28 granted while former President Joe Biden was in office. In Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service found 17 nationwide injunctions were issued during the first 100 days, though the Trump administration estimated last month there have been far more \u2014 at least 40 of these orders, and most coming from the same five judicial districts.",
      "Some of the justices have suggested in past writings that the Supreme Court would have to clarify whether nationwide injunctions are allowed at all, and members on both ideological sides of the bench have been critical of them. The president and his allies have\u00a0attacked judges\u00a0for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for\u00a0some to be impeached.",
      "The president's birthright citizenship order was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office. While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident. The president directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children in those categories born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-a-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the order. Federal appeals courts in California, Massachusetts and Virginia then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the cases. The administration said the Supreme Court should, at a minimum, allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance while proceedings continue, and took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts. Government lawyers said in a filing that universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "But the plaintiffs in the cases urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders in place. In a filing\u00a0of their own, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" since it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.\"",
      "The states argued that the Trump administration seeks to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "The court's decision",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett looked to the nation's history and said that nationwide injunctions were \"conspicuously nonexistent\" in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. If federal courts had such a tool, she said, \"surely they would not have let it lay idle.\"",
      "\"Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them,\" she wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court's new regime puts all manner of constitutional rights at risk and renders them \"meaningful in name only\" for people who are not parties to a lawsuit.",
      "\"Today, the threat is birthright citizenship,\" she wrote. \"Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the court's conservative majority of ignoring whether Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship is constitutional and said its \"patent unlawfulness\" underscores why universal injunctions are appropriate remedies.",
      "While the high court agreed to grant Mr. Trump's request for a partial stay of the injunctions, Barrett wrote that there are still issues for the lower courts to decide, including whether narrower relief is appropriate.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision still allows plaintiffs challenging a policy to file class-action lawsuits and seek certification of a nationwide class. In her dissent, Sotomayor urged individuals who may be impacted by Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan, as well as lower courts, to move swiftly.",
      "\"[T]he parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-action suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for the putative class pending class certification,\" she wrote. \"For suits challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order, moreover, lower courts would be wise to act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court's prompt review.\"",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, asked the federal district court to allow its lawsuit to proceed on a classwide basis and certify as a class \"all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will revoke the legal status and work permits of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in early September, arguing that conditions in Haiti have sufficiently improved for them to return home, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said it would terminate Haiti's longstanding Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed immigrants from the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation to live and work in the U.S. legally since 2010, following the devastating earthquake that year.",
      "If they don't qualify for another legal immigration status \u2014 like asylum or a green card \u2014 those who lose their TPS protections will become ineligible to work in the U.S. legally and eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday urged Haitians with TPS to voluntarily leave the U.S. by using a smartphone app that officials have converted into a system to facilitate self-deportations. The administration has warned immigrants in the U.S. illegally that if they don't self-deport, they will be found, arrested and forcibly deported.",
      "\"This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,\" DHS said in a statement. \"The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\"",
      "The government estimates that there are 348,187 Haitians in the U.S. with TPS, according to\u00a0a DHS notice. The department said their TPS protections would lapse on Sept. 2.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the federal government to offer migrants work permits and a reprieve from deportation if their home countries are engulfed in a crisis, such as a war or an environmental disaster.",
      "Despite the Trump administration's assertions on Friday, the U.S. government has described Haiti as a country with deep political instability and plagued by gang violence and widespread poverty. In fact, the State Department instructs Americans not to visit Haiti in a Level 4 travel advisory, warning them about the threat of \"robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom.\"",
      "The Biden administration vastly expanded the TPS program for Haitians, allowing many of those who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border \u2014 illegally and legally \u2014 to qualify for the initiative. It also used TPS at an unprecedented scale to offer legal status to hundreds of thousands migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Venezuela, Ukraine and other nations.",
      "But President Trump's administration has sought to severely curtail TPS programs, as part of its efforts to oversee the largest deportation effort in American history.",
      "Since Mr. Trump took office, officials have announced plans to terminate TPS protections for Afghans, Cameroonians   and Venezuelans. Last month, the Supreme Court allowed the administration to end the work permits and deportation protections of hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans TPS recipients.",

      "The Trump administration has pushed for a pause in fighting between Israel and Hamas for weeks, but a deal has proven elusive so far. Israel and Hamas have not publicly commented on whether a deal is possible soon.",
      "Late last month, Mr. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff proposed a 60-day ceasefire. Under that proposal, Hamas would release 10 living hostages and the remains of 18 dead hostages who were taken to Gaza during Hamas' 2023 attack on Israel, according to a copy obtained by CBS News. Israel would release 125 \"life sentence\" prisoners, 1,111 Palestinian detainees and 180 deceased Palestinians as part of the deal.",
      "Israel supported that proposal, but Hamas said it responded with \"some notes and amendments.\" Witkoff called Hamas' response \"totally unacceptable\" in a May 31 post on X.",
      "The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel, killing approximately 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages, many of whom have since been released. Israel responded with an invasion and intense aerial bombardment of the Gaza Strip, killing over 56,000 people, according to figures from the territory's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "Israel and Hamas have struck two ceasefire and hostage release deals since October 2023, the most recent of which \u2014 a 60-day pause in hostilities \u2014 ended in mid-March. Since then, the fighting has resumed.",

      "Separately, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, a U.S.- and Israel-backed private aid group, began distributing food in the Gaza Strip earlier this month.

    "story": [
      "On Friday, the fight with U.S. higher education started by America's 47th president, Donald Trump, landed at the university founded by its third president, Thomas Jefferson.",
      "The University of Virginia's president, James E. Ryan, submitted his resignation Friday in an effort to resolve Trump administration demands related to a federal\u00a0investigation\u00a0into the school's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The move is the first such pressure campaign on a public university, which is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's months-long national effort to reshape higher education at America's top universities. The Justice Department Civil Rights Division pressured the university to uproot diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as ordered by President Trump, and accused Ryan of simply rebranding them. Multiple sources familiar with the situation told CBS News that the university feared losing federal funding unless a compromise was reached. Ryan's resignation followed.",
      "In a letter to the UVA community, Ryan explained that he \"cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\" He nodded to a broad threat of federal action against the university and its students if he remained in office.",
      "\"To do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for the school said \"UVA is committed to complying with all federal laws and has been cooperating with the Department of Justice in the ongoing inquiries.\"",
      "\"The federal government's support of the University is essential to continue the core mission of research, education and, clinical care,\" said the spokesperson, Brian Coy. The New York Times first\u00a0reported\u00a0Ryan's intention to resign.",
      "A person familiar with the matter described the federal scrutiny as being like a \"nuclear bomb\" going off within the University of Virginia's administration.",
      "This source said lawmakers including senators urged Ryan not to resign and to remain in office until after the state's gubernatorial election concludes in November in case a Democratic candidate replaces Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A future Democratic governor might then be positioned to challenge Mr. Trump's order, as well as to dismiss Youngkin's conservative appointees to the university's Board of Visitors. That Board voted in the Spring to follow Mr. Trump's orders to excise DEI programs. Youngkin is thought to have presidential aspirations and has embraced Mr. Trump's anti-DEI platform.",
      "If Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger were to defeat Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, she would be able to act to preserve Ryan's standing, they said.",
      "Ryan is known for his efforts to advance diversity both at the University of Virginia and in his previous role as dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Harvard has also been a focus of Trump administration scrutiny, recently suing the federal government over its effort to bar it from admitting international students. Until now private universities, and specifically Ivy league schools had been the prime focus of the Trump administration's education litigation. Those efforts often cited efforts to combat accusations of anti-semitism on campus.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts have resulted in colleges nationwide, including Columbia University and the University of Michigan dramatically scaling back their diversity, equity and inclusion messaging and programs.",
      "The University of Virginia was designed and founded in 1819 by Jefferson. Education was central to his legacy, and he left explicit instructions for his gravestone to be inscribed with three accomplishments: author of the Declaration of independence, author of Virginia's statute of religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia.

      "Each of the four firms filed lawsuits arguing the orders violated the Constitution, and four different judges have skipped trials and ruled in their favor. The Trump administration has not appealed any of the decisions so far.",
      "AliKhan said in her ruling\u00a0that Mr. Trump's executive order regarding Susman Godfrey violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The order, she said, \"is unconstitutional from beginning to end.\"",
      "\"Here, the Order goes beyond violating the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" the judge wrote. \"The Order threatens the independence of the bar \u2014 a necessity for the rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the executive order targeting Susman Godfrey in April, which claimed that the firm \"spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.\"",
      "The firm, which has 350 employees, represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The suit was filed in response to unfounded claims aired by the network that Dominion helped rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. Fox News and Dominion reached a $787 million settlement agreement in 2023.",
      "The president's executive orders against the four law firms all sought to inflict similar harms, including by suspending active security clearances held by their employees, requiring government contractors to disclose any business with the firms and limiting government employees from engaging with their employees. The orders also restricted their access to federal buildings.",
      "Susman Godfrey, like the three others, sued the Trump administration shortly after the executive order was signed, arguing that it violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Lawyers for the firm said Mr. Trump's directive was \"unprecedented and unconstitutional\" and part of \"an express campaign of retaliation for representing clients and causes he disfavors or employing lawyers he dislikes.\"",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump's executive order targeting Perkins Coie went after the firm for its representation of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and its hiring of a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "His attempts to punish Jenner & Block and WilmerHale both invoked lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. At WilmerHale, that was Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. For Jenner & Block, the lawyer was Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on the Russian meddling case. Mueller, Quarles and Weissmann each left their firms several years ago.",
      "But the firms have also been involved in litigation challenging policies rolled out during Mr. Trump's second term. WilmerHale is representing\u00a0 a group of inspectors general who were fired by the president at the start of his administration, and Jenner & Block is involved in a challenge Mr. Trump's efforts to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people.",
      "Susman Godfrey continues to represent Dominion in defamation lawsuits arising out of baseless claims related to the 2020 election, including against Rudy Giuliani, conservative lawyer Sidney Powell and Newsmax.",
      "AliKhan, who was appointed to the district court by former President Joe Biden, had granted Susman Godfrey temporary relief in April and blocked the administration from enforcing parts of the executive order against the firm. Her final decision in favor of Susman Godfrey was not a surprise, since she had said at a hearing then that the executive order was \"based on a personal vendetta\" against the firm.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" she said in April.",
      "While the four firms have each successfully had the executive orders invalidated, other major firms have decided to enter into agreements with the president, seemingly to avoid being targeted themselves.",
      "Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was threatened with punishment in March, but Mr. Trump rescinded his executive order focusing on the firm after it committed to providing $40 million in pro bono work to support the administration's policies.",
      "Since then, eight more firms have reached deals with the White House that pledges of between $100 million and $125 million in free legal services. Mr. Trump has suggested using the law firms' promise of pro bono work to help the U.S. in trade negotiations over tariffs.",

      "The agreement brokered by the Trump administration is an effort to stop the bloodshed in the eastern part of the DRC, where a militia allegedly backed by Rwanda occupies large pieces of land. Rwanda has denied directly backing the rebels. Officials from both countries signed the agreement in Washington this week.",
      "\"So we're here today to celebrate a glorious triumph, and that's what it is, for the cause of peace,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office. \"This is a long time waiting. The signing of a historic peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Republic of Rwanda. The conflict has continued and it's been going on for many, many years. It's been going from, I guess they say 30 years.\"",
      "The region has been unstable for decades, and conflict in eastern Congo has led to thousands of deaths recently, and about 6 million deaths over the last three decades, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The conflict has spawned a humanitarian crisis and widespread displacement in eastern DRC.",

      "Mr. Trump on Friday took credit not just for the DRC-Rwanda agreement, but for his administration's role in intervening in other conflicts, too.",

      "\"If I think about what I know about these two countries, for 30 years, pretty much the entire time that I can remember these two countries being in the news, much of the story has been about them fighting one another, about them killing one another,\" Vance said. \"And now, we can look forward to a future where my children will look at this moment as the beginning of a new story, a story of prosperity and peace.\"",

Based on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately.\"",
      "Canada's digital services tax, which was enacted last year, will hit tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet (Google's parent company), Meta and Uber with a 3% tax on revenue from users in Canada.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' goal of sending President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" to his desk within the next week appears to be on shaky ground as the legislation runs into obstacles in the Senate, with changes that risk bleeding GOP support in the House.",
      "A day after Mr. Trump hosted an event at the White House to pressure lawmakers to pass the bill that includes tax cuts and funding for his border and national security priorities, the president signaled he's open to Republicans' self-imposed deadline slipping past July 4.",
      "\"It's important, it's not the end-all,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday about the deadline. \"We'd like to get it done by that time, if possible.\"",
      "Later in the day, Mr. Trump changed the goal posts again, posting on Truth Social that it \"must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also acknowledged the date may slide past the holiday, but said \"I don't want to even accept that as an option right now.\"",
      "\"We'll see,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota, said Friday afternoon when asked if Mr. Trump's initial comments on the timeline bought him more time to get the package through the Senate.",
      "Senators expect to begin voting on the bill Saturday, but have yet to release the final legislative text. The parliamentarian is continuing to determine which provisions comport with the rules governing the reconciliation process that allow Republicans to pass it with a simple majority.",
      "\"That's aspirational,\" Thune said about holding the first test vote midday Saturday, noting that they are still waiting on the parliamentarian to advise on a number of issues.",
      "The Senate leader also wasn't certain whether he had the votes to advance the legislation.",
      "\"We'll find out tomorrow,\" Thune said.",
      "House Democratic leadership issued guidance to members that votes are not expected over the weekend in the lower chamber and members would receive 48 hours notice before any potential votes next week.",
      "\"We can't make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,\" said Johnson. \"I'm going to give all of my members plenty of time to digest that. The House will not be jammed by anything. I made that commitment.\"",
      "Johnson said members would have 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian's guidance has delivered several blows to key GOP provisions, including an effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and a plan to lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs.",
      "Republicans have already struggled to reach a consensus on the provider tax as a handful of senators have expressed concern about the effects it could have on rural hospitals.",
      "Other recent ruled-out provisions include rolling back regulations on gun silencers, a religious carveout from an expansion of the college endowment tax, a $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.",
      "One such provision that received a green light from MacDonough was a revised plan to push some of the costs of food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto states. The benefits are currently funded by the federal government. The revision gives states more flexibility in calculating what their cost share requirement will be beginning in 2028.",
      "The parliamentarian also approved a revision on a proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans have drawn red lines on issues including the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and clean energy tax credits. Blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support for the bill before it passed the House in May if the SALT cap was not increased from $10,000. They ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",

      "As the Senate aims to vote on President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill ahead of the president's July 4 deadline, some advocates \u2014 including relatives of people killed in the American Airlines crash \u2014 say the current funding in the mega-bill is just the beginning of what is needed to overhaul the antiquated airspace system.",
      "\"We are very aware that [the funding] is a down payment only,\" Amy Hunter, cousin to Peter Livingston, who died in the Jan. 29 crash alongside his wife and two daughters, told CBS News. A total of 67 people died in the collision over the Potomac River, including American Airlines passengers and crew as well as the Black Hawk crew members.",
      "\"We have been assured that they understand, and the administration understands, that it has to be followed up basically immediately with the completion of funding for this project,\" Hunter said.",
      "As it stands, the Senate's version of the legislation \u2014 known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act \u2014 dedicates $12.5 billion to modernizing the air traffic control system. A version passed by the House last month also allocated $12.5 billion to transition from copper wires to fiber optics, buy new radios and build new radar systems in air traffic control facilities nationwide.",
      "This funding is just a fraction of what experts say is needed to completely overhaul the antiquated national airspace system. A coalition of industry groups and airlines has said at least $31 billion is needed for the overhaul.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has been clear-eyed that completely overhauling the national airspace system will require more funding.",
      "\"So $12.5 billion is really important. That gives us a start to build this project, which is why I aggressively support the big beautiful Bill. But it's not enough. Again, we need more money,\" Duffy said in a May press conference.",
      "The administration's plans to completely rebuild the air traffic control system include replacing outdated communication technologies, installing new software systems and building six new air traffic control centers for the first time since the 1960s.",
      "The White House has not provided a price tag for what the overhaul would cost, but said they hope to complete the project within four years.",
      "But for the families of AA5342 victims, more action is needed to address the nation's air traffic control system, particularly in the crowded airspace around Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, where a National Transportation Safety Board review found there were over 15,214 close calls between 2011 and 2024.",
      "The advocates have called for an independent safety review of that airspace, which can be enacted by Congress or asked for by Duffy.",
      "Additionally, several family members of victims told CBS News the Army has not spoken with their family about the crash, which was the deadliest airline accident in the U.S. since November 2001. CBS News has reached out to the Army for comment, but has not received a response.",
      "\"We are grieving families and we are advocates, but we are Americans. We benefit from a strong prepared military and that's what we want to make sure of,\" Rachel Feres, another cousin of the Livingston family, said.",
      "Families say they aren't looking for blame and want to look forward, but they feel that they shouldn't be the only advocates for making the nation's skies safer.",
      "\"We know it's a very long path. For clarity, we think that it shouldn't be a requirement that the families are involved. We should be able to grieve in private,\"\u00a0 Hunter said. \"That is not a reality of today.\"",

      "\"A short delay will prevent the government from removing Mr. Abrego and allow time for the government to provide reliable information concerning its intentions,\" the lawyers wrote.",
      "Abrego Garcia is to be tried on human smuggling charges, but the Trump administration had said that if he were to be released pending trial, he would swiftly be taken into custody by immigration authorities and deported.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors signaled Thursday that Immigration and Customs Enforcement would detain and move to deport Abrego Garcia to a third-country \u2014 one that is not his country of origin, El Salvador \u2014 if he were to be released from criminal custody, as was expected. But a Justice Department spokesperson then suggested Abrego Garcia would not be deported until after his criminal trial concludes.",
      "In announcing that Abrego Garcia had been indicted earlier this month, Attorney General Pam Bondi said if he is convicted on the smuggling charges, Abrego Garcia would be returned to El Salvador after completing his sentence.",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ordered released by U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes after she denied a Justice Department request to keep him detained while awaiting a criminal trial. The Justice Department appealed Holmes' order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause her decision. Holmes said earlier this week that Abrego Garcia would remain in U.S. Marshal custody until at least Friday while his lawyers and prosecutors submitted additional filings on his conditions for release.",

    "story": [
      "An Afghan man who worked alongside U.S. troops in Afghanistan was placed in expedited removal in San Diego on Thursday, according to court documents reviewed by CBS News. Sayed Naser was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers two weeks earlier when he appeared at the San Diego federal courthouse for his mandatory immigration hearing.",
      "\"DHS elected to exercise its broad discretion to dismiss removal proceedings and instead place the respondent in expedited removal within two years of his entry date,\" says the order signed by Judge Catherin Halliday-Roberts.",
      "Shawn VanDiver, executive director for #AfghanEvac, a nonprofit that advocates for U.S. wartime allies, criticized the ruling, saying, \"A bureaucratic technically just stripped a wartime ally of his legal protections and fast-tracked him for deportation.\"",
      "\"Sayed stood with U.S. forces in combat. Now he faces removal without a lawyer, without a hearing and possibly without a country. This isn't just cruel, it's cowardly,\" VanDiver said.",
      "Since his arrest, Naser \u2014 whose full name is being withheld because of safety concerns \u2014 has been held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, according to his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick.",
      "Naser will soon participate in a \"credible threat\" interview over the phone with an officer from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, without his lawyer, but it is not clear from the order when the interview will take place. If he can demonstrate that he would face significant harm in his home country, he will be allowed to apply for asylum.",
      "If he does not pass his credible fear interview, he will be deported to an unknown destination including a potential third-party country, says McGoldrick.",
      "In a video obtained by CBS News, two unidentified ICE agents put Naser in handcuffs and escorted him from the courthouse on June 12.",
      "An Afghan ally who served alongside U.S. forces was legally paroled into the U.S. and showed up for his first hearing.@DHSGov detained him anyway\u2014using a vague \u201cimprovidently issued\u201d excuse.He followed the rules.We have the video.This must stop.#AfghanEvac #DueProcess pic.twitter.com/zZXjzQUDMT",
      "Naser was legally paroled into the U.S in 2024, according to immigration case files reviewed by CBS News. In addition to an active asylum case, he has a pending Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) case because of his long history supporting the U.S. military. SIVs are provided to foreign nationals who worked with U.S. military forces\u00a0in war zones including Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. Naser has no criminal record in the U.S. or Afghanistan, according to court records reviewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This man served with our troops. He came through the front door. He followed every rule. And we locked him up anyway,\" said\u00a0 VanDiver. He said it's unknown how many Afghan allies have been detained by ICE officials.",
      "Naser served as a civilian interpreter for the U.S. military in Afghanistan from 2015 to 2018. He and his brothers also co-owned a logistics company that provided anti-mining support to American troops, according to employment records viewed by CBS News.",
      "\"This individual was an important part of our Company commitment to provide the best possible service for our clients, who were the United States Military in Afghanistan,\" says one employment document submitted as part of Naser's SIV application.",
      "But after the U.S. withdrew from the country in August 2021, his partnership with American forces put targets on the backs of Naser and his family. In 2023, Taliban fighters killed his brother and abducted his father at a family wedding. The attack drove Naser out of the country and forced his wife and children to flee their home.",
      "\"I cannot return to Afghanistan under any circumstances because I am accused of collaborating with U.S. forces. From the Taliban's perspective, anyone who worked with foreign forces during the past 20 years is a spy, an infidel, and must be killed,\" Naser wrote in his asylum declaration. His family remains in hiding outside of Afghanistan.",
      "After his brother was killed, Naser fled to Brazil, where he was granted a humanitarian visa. He then made the more than 6,000 mile journey on foot through the Dari\u00e9n Gap before reaching Mexico. In 2024, he set up an appointment with U.S. Customs and Border Protection through the app formerly known as CBP One \u2014 which allowed migrants to schedule appointments at legal ports of entry \u2014 where he was granted lawful parole into the U.S.",
      "As part of his asylum process, Naser was required to attend an in-person hearing last week in front of a judge and a lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security. But when Naser showed up to court, the DHS lawyer said that his case was \"'improvidently issued.\"",
      "\"Nobody knows what that means,\" said McGoldrick, who tried to dispute the ruling. When pressed, the DHS lawyer refused to clarify further.",
      "\"'Improvidently issued' is becoming ICE's new catch-all \u2014 a vague, unchallengeable justification being used to clear dockets and meet removal and detention quotas,\" said VanDiver. \"It's being weaponized to put lawful, parole-compliant asylum-seekers in cells.\"",
      "When Naser left the courtroom after his hearing ended, he was immediately detained by ICE agents.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, DHS said Naser \"entered the U.S. unvetted via the CBP One app under the previous administration in 2024. There is nothing in his immigration records indicating that he assisted the U.S. government in any capacity. All of his claims will be heard by a judge. Any Afghan who fears persecution is able to request asylum.\"",
      "Naser is now being held in the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego. According to McGoldrick, he could be kept there for up to three months while his asylum case is adjudicated. If he is denied asylum, Naser will be put on an expedited removal list and likely deported. His lawyer does not know where he would be deported to.",
      "\"He's still in shock. He cannot believe this is happening to him,\" McGoldrick said.",
      "Naser's wife, who remains in hiding with their children, found out about her husband's detention when she saw the video of his detainment on social media.",
      "Increase in arrests in courthouses",
      "The last few weeks have seen an increase in ICE arrests outside of immigration hearings in courthouses around major American cities. In May, CBS News reported that the Trump administration was launching an operation to expedite the deportation of certain migrants by dismissing their cases and subsequently arresting them at courthouses around the country. The move shocked immigration advocates, as their clients are legally required to show up at their hearings.",
      "Public arrests outside courts in Los Angeles led to more than a week of demonstrations as protesters faced off against thousands of law enforcement officials, including the National Guard.",
      "On Sunday, Mr. Trump called on ICE to increase arrests in order to achieve his goal of the \"largest Mass Deportation Operation of Illegal Aliens in History,\" according to a post on Truth Social, the social media platforms he owns.",
      "Reports from within the administration say that White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have been pushing agencies since late May to meet a higher quota of deportations \u2014 including as much as 3,000 immigration-related arrests per day.",
      "Typically, ICE agents need probable cause in order to detain someone to check their immigration status. This requires a higher standard of evidence pointing to an individual's alleged violation of immigration law.",
      "It's not clear in Naser's case what evidence there is that he was violating the law, his lawyer said. ICE provided a warrant for Naser's arrest to his attorney outside the courtroom after he was detained.",
      "\"It's really shocking what's happening in courthouses in San Diego and around the country,\" said McGoldrick. \"You walk down the hall and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all these armed personnel just eyeballing everybody as we come down. It's just so intimidating that our clients are terrorized.\"",
      "Uncertain future for thousands of Afghans",
      "The Trump administration has demonstrated a sharp turn away from supporting Afghans who worked with the U.S. government in the military's two-decade-long conflict with the Taliban.",
      "In May, Noem announced that the administration was terminating Temporary Protected Status for Afghans. TPS is an immigration designation that allows people from countries deemed dangerous by the U.S. to live and work in the United States without being detained by DHS. Nearly 11,000 Afghans who are in the U.S. under TPS will be at risk of deportation when the change in policy comes into effect in mid-July, said VanDiver.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump administration also instituted a travel ban on nationals from Afghanistan and 11 other countries, citing a need to address security concerns. Ahead of this announcement, over 100,000 Afghan wartime allies and their families had been vetted and cleared to enter the U.S., says #AfghanEvac. They are now unable to travel to the U.S. unless they are granted an SIV visa and can fund their own travel, without government support. Many live in danger of retribution from the Taliban.",
      "\"Afghanistan remains under the control of the Taliban. There are still assassinations, arbitrary arrests, and ongoing human rights abuses, especially against women and ethnic minorities,\" said VanDiver. \"The United States cannot abandon its allies and call that immigration policy.\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court, ruling in the birthright citizenship case, reined in federal judges' ability to issue nationwide injunctions.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised the Supreme Court for its decision Friday limiting the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, calling it a \"monumental victory for the Constitution.\"",
      "In comments at the White House, the president said, \"This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.\"",
      "The Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges, a practice the president and his allies have railed against as blocking or hindering their agenda. In a\u00a06-3 decision\u00a0that stemmed from the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court said universal injunction orders likely exceeded the authority Congress has given the federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump called the use of nationwide injunctions \"a grave threat to democracy, frankly.\"",
      "Thanks to this decision, the president said the administration can \"now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" including his effort to end birthright citizenship. Attorney General Pam Bondi predicted the Supreme Court would \"most likely\" rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case during the next Supreme Court term, which begins this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump repeated a statement he often makes about birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment, saying that it's no longer being used as it was originally intended. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn't meant for that reason,\" he said. \"It was meant for the babies of slaves.\"",
      "The president thanked Barrett for writing the opinion \"brilliantly,\" and also the justices who sided with her.",
      "In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,\" and the court's ruling means that \"absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also applauded other Supreme Court rulings, including a decision Friday to allow parents in a Maryland school district to opt their children out of storybooks based on objections to their approach to gender and sexuality.",
      "\"I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents,\" the president said.",
      "The president addressed other topics beyond the Supreme Court rulings, too, including his administration's tariffs and his trade negotiations with other countries. Although the president indicated his administration is close to deals with several countries, he said at some point in the next week and a half, his administration will be sending letters to some countries \"and tell them what they have to pay.\"",
      "On Iran, the president expressed support for any new agreement with Iran, including a provision that the International Atomic Energy Agency \u2014 or \"somebody\" approved by the U.S. \u2014 act as an independent inspector to examine Iranian nuclear facilities.",
      "One reporter asked the president if he would consider bombing Iran again, if U.S. intelligence shows the country can still enrich uranium to a level that concerns him.",
      "\"Sure,\" Mr. Trump responded. \"Without question.\"",
      "At the NATO summit in the Netherlands earlier this week, the president said the U.S. would have talks with Iran \"next week,\" but on Thursday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said there are currently no plans for formal talks or meetings.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that created a second majority-Black district.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of its term restored the case to its calendar for reargument, with an additional scheduling order to come. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move means the state's map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance complying with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to have implications for the balance of power in the House in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to hold onto their razor-thin majority.",
      "The legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned several years and began after the state legislature redrew the six House districts in early 2022. A federal judge in Baton Rouge ruled that year that the map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength, and ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "That initial map had one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts, even though African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The new map adopted by the state legislature reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers said. But they said they also had a second goal: to protect powerful Republican incumbents in the House, namely Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow. Letlow is the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, state officials noted.",
      "The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge in the southeast, connecting predominantly Black communities along the way.",
      "But after the new voting lines were adopted, 12 \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged the reconfigured District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sitting in Shreveport agreed and said the legislature relied too much on race when it drew the new House district lines. Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups \u2014 who were on opposing sides in the challenge to the original map \u2014 to ask the Supreme Court to let the state use the new congressional map for the 2024 elections.",
      "The high court granted their request for emergency relief, and in November, Louisiana voters sent two Black Democrats to Congress. The Supreme Court then agreed to take up the case.",
      "The redistricting dispute is one of several the high court has been confronted with in recent years, and more continue to make their way to the justices. In a landmark 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, which required certain states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to receive Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.",
      "Then, in 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have a role to play in deciding legal fights over partisan gerrymandering, when state's voting lines are drawn to entrench the political party in power.",
      "But in an unexpected ruling in 2023, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the high court invalidated Alabama's congressional map crafted after the 2020 Census, which ultimately led to the election of the state's second Black House member.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld a Texas law that requires pornography websites to verify their visitors' age, finding that the lower court applied the appropriate level of judicial review when evaluating the constitutionality of the age-verification laws.",
      "The high court divided 6-3 along ideological lines, with Justice Clarence Thomas authoring the decision for the majority. The Supreme Court said that the law survives a more heightened form of judicial scrutiny.",
      "\"We granted certiorari to decide whether these burdens likely render [Texas law] H. B. 1181 unconstitutional under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. We hold that they do not,\" Thomas wrote. \"The power to require age verification is within a State's authority to prevent children from accessing sexually explicit content,\" he continued, saying Texas' law \"is a constitutionally permissible exercise of that authority.\"",
      "\"The statute does not ban adults from accessing this material; it simply requires them to verify their age before accessing it on a covered website,\" Thomas noted.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan wrote in the dissenting opinion that while \"everyone agrees that shielding children from exposure to the sexually explicit speech H. B. 1181 targets is a compelling state interest,\" the Texas law should be subject to the most stringent standard of judicial review, strict scrutiny, because it impedes adults' ability to view constitutionally protected speech based on its content.",
      "\"That is what foundational First Amendment principles demand,\" Kagan concluded.",
      "While the law at issue in the case was passed in Texas, 18 other states have approved similar measures that require pornography websites to ensure that visitors are at least 18 years old. Challengers to the Texas law \u2014 a group of companies that operate covered websites and a trade group called the Free Speech Coalition \u2014 have argued that it violates the First Amendment by burdening adults' access to protected speech.",
      "Under the Texas law, enacted in 2023, entities must comply if more than one-third of their web content is \"sexual material harmful to minors,\" which is considered to be content that is prurient, offensive and without value to minors. Companies subject to its requirements have to verify users' ages through digital identification or a government-issued ID.",
      "Violators face civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day or fines of up to $250,000 if a violation leads to a minor accessing sexual material. Internet service providers, search engines and social media companies are effectively exempt from the law.",
      "In response to the challenge to the law brought by the Free Speech Coalition and website operators, a federal district court judge agreed to block enforcement of the age-verification requirement. But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit froze that decision, which allowed the law to take effect. The Supreme Court last year allowed Texas to continue enforcing the age-verification measure while it weighed the case, known as Free Speech Coalition v. Paxton.",
      "The key question before the high court was whether the 5th Circuit applied the correct standard of review when it evaluated the age-verification law. The appeals court applied the most deferential level of review, rational basis, and found that the requirement satisfied it. But the plaintiffs in the case and the Biden administration said the appeals court was wrong to apply that standard and should have instead analyzed it under the most demanding level, strict scrutiny, because the law impedes adults' access to speech protected by the Constitution.",
      "Rational-basis review requires laws to serve a legitimate governmental purpose and be reasonably related to that purpose. Under strict scrutiny, however, the government bears the burden of showing that a law is narrowly tailored to serve a \"compelling government interest.\"",

      "William F. Buckley (1925-2008), founder of the National Review and host of the TV debate show \"Firing Line,\" was a leading political commentator who catalyzed America's conservative movement with his support of such figures as Joseph McCarthy, Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan.",
      "In his new biography, \"Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America\" (published by Random House), historian Sam Tanenhaus (author of books on Whittaker Chambers and Louis Armstrong) writes about the life and influence of Buckley, whose drive to push America to the right would alter the Republican Party and lead to the rise of Donald Trump.",

      "William F. Buckley, Jr., the intellectual leader of the modern conservative movement, rightly saw himself less as founder than heir. Everything he learned, and all he became, began at home.",
      "It started with his father, William F. Buckley, Sr., a lawyer, real estate investor, and oil speculator who grew up in the brush country, the scrubland frontier, of Duval County in South Texas. He was thirty-five and had made his first fortune when, on a visit to New Orleans, he met twenty-two-year-old Aloise Steiner, the eldest of three sisters of Swiss and German background\u2014\"the very essence of old New Orleans charm,\" said one of the many men smitten by her. She had a year or two of college, played Mozart on the piano, and told captivating if not always quite credible stories\u2014for instance, of the fourteen marriage proposals she claimed to have turned down before W.F. Buckley began courting her in the spring of 1917.",
      "The physical attraction was immediate, almost electric. Many years later the couple's children remembered the \"frisson\" that connected their parents. The couple also shared a deep and abiding Catholic faith. After the wedding ceremony at the Steiner family's parish church, Mater Dolorosa on South Carrollton Avenue, on December 29, 1917, the Buckleys began their married life in Mexico. W.F. Buckley had been living there since 1908. He had apartments and law offices in Mexico City as well as in Tampico\u2014the oil boomtown on the Gulf where, after building a prosperous law practice writing oil leases, he had gone into real estate and then into oil, borrowing substantial sums to sink five wells on the banks of the Panuco River.",
      "Oil speculation was always a high-risk venture, but especially in Mexico. It was in the throes of the twentieth century's first great revolution, its ten-year-long \"bloody fiesta,\"\u2009which ended in 1920 with the rout of the right-wing faction Buckley had supported and the election of a new president he despised. It was a stinging defeat, and he would never get over it. Yet he also could say, and often did\u2014to his children most emphatically\u2014that although he had lost, he had done so on his terms, without giving an inch to the opposition. Other oilmen, including some far wealthier and more powerful than he, had submitted to the new order and made lucrative deals with each fresh regime. W.F. Buckley refused to do it. He left Mexico\u2014in fact was expelled by order of its government\u2014with debts totaling one million dollars. In later years he showed his children a treasured souvenir from those times, an architect's sketch of the grand palacio, with private chapel, which W.F. Buckley had planned to build on substantial property he had purchased in Coyoacan.",
      "Bankrupt at age forty, Buckley would have to start all over. He had a family to support, his wife and three small children, now living with his mother and two sisters in Austin, Texas. But there was a new opportunity. In fact, having to put Mexico behind him might be for the best. The oil fields in its Golden Lane were nearly tapped out. The great new oil patch was in Venezuela. Once again there were large profits to be made but also many hazards\u2014in this case \"hostile Indian tribes,\" as well as malaria and fatal \"liver and intestinal disorders.\" Visitors were advised to stay no longer than a few weeks.",
      "For W.F. Buckley admonitions were a goad. He went to Venezuela, stayed a full six months, and came back in 1924 with leasing rights to three million acres surrounding Lake Maracaibo, spreading east and west, a complexly organized checker-board whose squares \"in practically every instance adjoin properties that are being actively developed by major American oil companies,\" it was reported at the time. The concession was \"rated among the most valuable in Venezuela.\"",
      "Buckley, now based in New York, formed a new company, Pantepec (named for a river in Mexico), and with the sponsorship of the Wall Street broker Edward A. Pierce floated stock shares and secured investments from two California majors: Union Oil and California Petroleum. Matching wits against some of the finest legal minds in the United States, W.F. Buckley worked out the terms for an innovative \"farm-out.\" In return for gaining temporary control of a third of the holdings, the two behemoths would cover the costs of exploration and drilling and reap most of the profits once oil was struck. W.F. Buckley would be allotted a tiny fraction of those profits, and he now had funds to send teams of engineers and geologists to explore the remaining two million acres.",
      "Remade as a Wall Street speculator, W.F. Buckley bought a suite of offices on lower Park Avenue and furnished them sumptuously, the better to impress investors. He also bought an apartment building nearby where he stayed alone during the week. Jazz Age Manhattan, with its speakeasies and fleshpots and lurking criminal element, was no place for his wife and growing family. They lived on his third shrewd purchase, a large estate in the rural northwest corner of Connecticut.",
      "On Fridays, the work week finished, W.F. Buckley walked a few blocks uptown from his office to Grand Central and rode the train home to his family, three full hours through exurban New York\u2014Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess counties\u2014all the way to Amenia, where a Buick sat idling with the Black \"houseboy,\" James Cole of New Orleans, behind the wheel in a chauffeur's cap. Together they drove three miles along a country road and, if daylight remained, enjoyed the vista\u2014the wooded Litchfield Hills and the dipping valley, the bright quilt of dairy farms\u2014and then crossed the Connecticut state line at Sharon, a picturesque village of fifteen hundred, incorporated in 1739 and named for the fertile Biblical plain. A favorite weekend and summer getaway for wealthy New Yorkers, Sharon was famous for its narrow elongated green, originally grazing land, which gracefully stretched for more than a mile from its north end\u2014with storefronts and wooden walkways where in summer elms arched overhead, the branches on either side touching to form a canopy\u2014to South Main Street. There, near the town hall and the Hotchkiss Library, stood what is still today Sharon's chief landmark: a granite-and-brownstone clock tower, forty feet high with a pyramid roof, built in the 1880s by the same firm that designed Theodore Roosevelt's Sagamore Hill estate on Oyster Bay, Long Island.",
      "On either side of South Main, set back from the street, were large and imposing manor houses. The Buckleys lived in one of them, Number 32, called the Ansel Sterling House after its first owner, a lawyer and judge twice elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1820s. Sterling had purchased the property in 1808 and then torn down the original brick, replacing it with a Georgian frame structure. Over time the ten-acre property had tripled to thirty acres, beautiful and lush, with thick stands of oaks and sugar maples, outbuildings including barn, stables, and icehouse, and horse trails that wound through the rolling pastures and up into the gentle hills beyond. Today Ansel Sterling's house still stands, though much enlarged by W.F. Buckley. Its handsome entrance with pediment and pillars stares across Main Street at Sharon's two historic churches: little Christ Church Episcopal, with its witch-hat spire, and the Congregational church, the town's oldest.",
      "In 1923, when W.F. Buckley first toured the property and rented it for the summer, its most striking feature was the elm that towered up from its front lawn. It had been planted in colonial times by Sharon's most illustrious forefather, the Congregational minister Reverend Cotton Mather Smith, a descendant of Cotton Mather. It was now the largest elm in the entire state, its immense trunk measuring eighteen feet around. In 1924, the same year Main Street was paved for motor traffic, Buckley bought the estate outright and renamed it Great Elm.",
      "This was the new life Buckley had conjured in a few short years, seemingly pulled out of thinnest air, for his wife and growing family. So promising did the future look that when a sixth child was born on November 24, 1925, husband and wife agreed that this son, their third, should be his father's namesake: William F. Buckley, Jr.",
      "It was always an event when \"Father\" came home. The children who were not away at school or upstairs in the nursery crowded in front of the house to greet him. \"We'd wait there for his car to come,\" one of his six daughters remembered, \"and make bets on which car would be Father's.\" He was delighted to see them, but even happier to see his wife. \"He'd kiss us all and he'd say, 'Where's your mother?' Mother would come and say, 'Darling,' and the two of them would walk out together.\"",
      "No one felt these currents more keenly than Billy Buckley, who had the middle child's fear of being overlooked, lost in the crowd. And the Buckley siblings really were a crowd: ten in all, many of them very close in age, five born ahead of Billy and four after. With servants added, as well as tutors, workmen, groomsmen for the horses, and later a riding instructor and his family, the household numbered more than twenty and was alive with pranks, schemes, hilarity, and strife.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Federal Communications Commission's multi-billion-dollar mechanism for expanding phone and internet access to rural and low-income communities.",
      "The high court ruled that neither Congress nor the FCC violated the Constitution with its chosen scheme for administering the Universal Service Fund, which is supported by contributions from communications carriers and funds programs designed to improve access to telecommunications services.",
      "Justice Elena Kagan authored the majority opinion for the 6-3 court, with Justices Neil Gorsuch, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito in dissent.",
      "\"For nearly three decades, the work of Congress and the Commission in establishing universal-service programs has led to a more fully connected country. And it has done so while leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "With its decision, the high court passed on an opportunity to revive a long-dormant legal concept known as the nondelegation doctrine, which some conservative justices have in recent years expressed support for revisiting.",
      "Rooted in the separation of powers, the doctrine restricts Congress from delegating its legislative powers to executive branch agencies. A conservative nonprofit called Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund, arguing that Congress' delegation of power to the FCC and the FCC's delegation to a private corporation that sets carriers' contribution rates was unlawful.",
      "But the Supreme Court rejected the group's challenge and found that the Universal Service Fund does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.",
      "Established by the FCC after Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund aims to ensure communications systems are available nationwide. Carriers pay into the fund and the contributions are used to subsidize phone and internet services to low-income customers, rural and high-cost areas and to schools, libraries and rural health care providers.",
      "The FCC created the Universal Service Administrative Company in 1997 to administer the fund and determine the amount carriers have to pay into it. The not-for-profit corporation also disburses money to program beneficiaries.",
      "Fees are set based on a percentage of a carriers' revenue, and telecommunications companies pass on their share to consumers. The program collects nearly $10 billion annually, according to the administrator.",
      "More than 12,000 schools and libraries, and more than 9,000 rural health care providers have benefited from initiatives backed by the Universal Service Fund, and more than 8 million low-oncome households have been served.",
      "The legal battle at the Supreme Court started in 2022 when a group of consumers, a carrier and the nonprofit Consumers' Research challenged the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that the fund is unlawful because Congress unconstitutionally delegated its authority to the FCC, which in turn transferred power to the Universal Service Administrative Company. The full U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit sided with Consumers' Research and found that the combination of Congress' delegation to the FCC, and the commission's subdelegation to the fund administrator violates the Constitution.",
      "The Justice Department under former President Joe Biden asked the Supreme Court to review the 5th Circuit's ruling, and the Trump administration continued to defend the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the structure of a federal health task force that recommends preventive medical services that must be provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court in the case known as Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. leaves intact the 16-member U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. The task force is part of the Department of Health and Human Service and has for decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions.",
      "The court ruled 6-3 in finding that the task force members are inferior officers, whose appointment by the head of Health and Human Services is consistent with the Constitution's Appointments Clause. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored the majority opinion, with Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch in dissent.",
      "\"[T]he Task Force members' appointments are fully consistent with the Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"The structure of the Task Force and the manner of appointing its officers preserve the chain of political accountability that was central to the Framers' design of the Appointments Clause: The Task Force members were appointed by and are supervised and directed by the Secretary of HHS. And the Secretary of HHS, in turn, answers to the president of the United States.\"",
      "The work of the task force took on added significance after passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010. The law requires health insurers and group health plans to provide preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "A group of Christian-owned businesses and individuals filed a lawsuit arguing that the preventive-care coverage mandates cannot be enforced because the task force members were unconstitutionally appointed.",
      "The plaintiffs specifically took issue with the task force's recommendation in June 2019 that PrEP, a medication to prevent HIV, be included in the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. They argued that providing no-cost coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Among the other preventive services recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes, and statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke.",
      "A federal district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found that the task force's structure is unconstitutional under the Constitution's Appointments Clause. The courts concluded that its members are principal officers and therefore had to be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "But the Supreme Court reversed the 5th Circuit's ruling, finding that task force members are \"inferior officers\" since they are \"removable at will by the Secretary of HHS, and their recommendations are reviewable by the Secretary before they take effect.\"",
      "\"So Task Force members are supervised and directed by the Secretary, who in turn answers to the President, preserving the chain of command in Article II,\" Kavanaugh wrote.",
      "The dispute over the task force saw rare agreement between the Biden administration, which appealed the 5th Circuit's decision to the Supreme Court, and the Trump administration, which continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "But the legal wrangling over the preventive coverage mandates also threatened to put at risk access to preventive care. Nonprofit organizations warned the Supreme Court that eliminating cost-sharing for services like breast cancer screenings or HIV-prevention medications would dissuade patients from seeking medical care.",

    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" and the program was set back by years.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some Senate Democrats cast doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities after top officials briefed senators Thursday.",
      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges. And if they still have enriched uranium and they still have the ability to use centrifuges, then you're not setting back the program by years. You're setting back the program by months.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that the administration jumped to a conclusion too soon.",
      "\"Listen, I hope that is the final assessment,\" Warner said. \"But if not, does that end up providing a false sense of comfort to the American people?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he did not receive adequate answers about whether the nuclear stockpile was obliterated.",
      "\"What was clear is that there was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear weapon,\" Schumer said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said only a final battle damage assessment confirming the assertions \"would enable us to be comfortable or complacent about what has been done.\"",
      "\"The point is, we don't know. Anybody who says we know with certainty is making it up because we don't have a final battle damage assessment,\" he said. \"I think 'obliterated' is much too strong of word because it implies that it couldn't be reconstituted or somehow it was completely eliminated.\"",
      "Still, Blumenthal praised the military action as \"one that will go down in the annals of military history.\"",
      "\"Certainly, this mission was successful insofar as it extensively destroyed and perhaps severely damaged and set back the Iranian nuclear arms program. But how long and how much really remains to be determined by the intelligence community itself,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stood behind the administration's characterization, but acknowledged that Iran's capabilities could eventually be restored.",
      "\"The real question is, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear weapon,\" Graham said after the classified briefing. \"I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or obliterated. It was. But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it's not.\"",
      "Graham said he believed the program had been set back by years. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he was confident \"it's been set way back \u2014 a year, at minimum.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the strikes \"effectively destroyed Iran's nuclear program.\" Cotton added that the initial assessment had several intelligence gaps and \"assumed the worst-case scenario with perfect conditions in Iran.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said.",
      "Ratcliffe was among those who briefed senators Thursday, along with Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.",
      "The briefing had been initially scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed two days, upsetting some Democrats who demanded immediate transparency about the strikes after they were initially left in the dark about the military action.",

      "That privilege came in the form of a family reunification visa, which Llanes said Sofia was approved for. Sofia was awaiting the final step in the visa process: an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Cuba.",
      "But the interview never happened. On June 5, Mr. Trump signed a proclamation barring travelers and immigrants from 12 countries from entering the U.S., citing U.S. national security interests. It also partially restricted entry for nationals from another seven countries, including Cuba, with only certain exemptions. Under the ban, only U.S. citizens can apply to sponsor relatives from Cuba, not green card holders like Llanes.",
      "\"It was a big blow because she was already approved, and she was preparing, learning English,\" Llanes said, adding that Sofia was left so devastated by the ban that she went two days without wanting to speak with anyone.",
      "Sofia spoke briefly this week with CBS News by phone, saying she wants to be with her mother.",
      "Mr. Trump has argued the ban is necessary to keep the nation safe. The State Department has said another 36 countries could be added to the list due to security concerns.",

      "Scientists have identified what could be the oldest rocks on Earth from a rock formation in Canada.",
      "The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt has long been known for its ancient rocks - plains of streaked gray stone on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Quebec. But researchers disagree on exactly how old they are.",
      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",

      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",

She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth.

    "summary": "The debut images from a powerful telescope at Chile's Vera Rubin Observatory show distant galaxies and star-forming regions in spectacular detail.",
    "story": [
      "The first images from a new telescope in Chile were released this week, featuring extraordinarily detailed scenes from deep space. And more are expected to follow the debut series from the long-awaited Vera Rubin Observatory, which now houses the largest telescope in the world.",
      "More than two decades in the making, the giant U.S.-funded telescope sits perched at the summit of Cerro Pachon in central Chile, where dark skies and dry air provide ideal conditions for observing the cosmos. The first-look images captured star-forming regions as well as distant galaxies.",
      "One of them is a composite of 678 exposures taken over just seven hours, capturing the Trifid Nebula and the Lagoon Nebula \u2014 both several thousand light-years from Earth \u2014 glowing in vivid pinks against orange-red backdrops.",
      "The image reveals these stellar nurseries within our Milky Way in unprecedented detail, with previously faint or invisible features now clearly visible.",
      "Another image offers a sweeping view of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies.",
      "The team also released a video dubbed the \"cosmic treasure chest,\" which begins with a close-up of two galaxies before zooming out to reveal approximately 10 million more.",
      "\"The Rubin Observatory is an investment in our future, which will lay down a cornerstone of knowledge today on which our children will proudly build tomorrow,\" said Michael Kratsios, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.",
      "Equipped with an advanced 8.4-meter telescope and the largest digital camera ever built, the Rubin Observatory is supported by a powerful data-processing system.",
      "Later this year, it will begin its flagship project, the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Over the next decade, it will scan the night sky nightly, capturing even the subtlest visible changes with unmatched precision.",
      "A galactic preview of the unprecedented visuals to come TODAY at 11 a.m. EDT from the NSF-DOE Rubin Observatory. Watch the livestream here: https://bit.ly/RubinFirstLook. \n\n\ud83d\udcf9: National Science Foundation (NSF) - U.S. Department of Energy Vera C. Rubin Observatory\n\n#CaptureTheCosmos #RubinFirstLook",
      "Elana Urbach, a commissioning scientist on the project, told CBS News partner BBC News\u00a0that one of the observatory's main goals is to \"understand the history of the universe.\" That would mean having the ability to see galaxies or supernova explosions that occurred billions of years ago, according to BBC News.",
      "\"So, we really need very sharp images,\" Urbach said.",
      "The design of the telescope allows it to capture a lot of light, and, in turn, observe objects that are very far away, Guillem Megias, an optics expert at the Rubin Observatory, told BBC News. Megias noted that, in astronomy, \"really far away ... means they come from earlier times.\"",
      "The observatory is named after pioneering American astronomer Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided the first conclusive evidence for the existence of dark matter \u2014 a mysterious substance that does not emit light but exerts gravitational influence on galaxies.",
      "Dark energy refers to the equally mysterious and immensely powerful force believed to be driving the accelerating expansion of the universe. Together, dark matter and dark energy are thought to make up 95 percent of the cosmos, yet their true nature remains unknown.",
      "The observatory, a joint initiative of the U.S. National Science Foundation and Department of Energy, has also been hailed as one of the most powerful tools ever built for tracking asteroids.",
      "In just 10 hours of observations, the Rubin Observatory discovered 2,104 previously undetected asteroids in our solar system, including seven near-Earth objects \u2014 all of which pose no threat.",
      "For comparison, all other ground- and space-based observatories combined discover about 20,000 new asteroids per year.",
      "Rubin is also set to be the most effective observatory at spotting interstellar objects passing through the solar system.",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",
      "Meta also won a major victory this week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the methods the company used to train its artificial intelligence technology. The case was brought by a group of well-known authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and writer Jacqueline Woodson, who alleged Meta was \"liable for massive copyright infringement\" when it used copies of their books to train Meta's generative AI system Llama.",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 08:00:11 -0400",
    "summary": "Now in its sixth month, President Trump's administration has become the antithesis of progress, many LGBTQ Americans say.",
    "story": [
      "In Marsha P. Johnson's final interview before her death in 1992, the activist later recognized as an icon of the movement that preceded LGBTQ rights in the United States explained why she, a transgender woman, championed a cause that often excluded her.",
      "\"I've been walking for gay rights all these years,\" Johnson said, referencing early Pride marches in a conversation that appears in a 2012 documentary about her life. \"Because you never completely have your rights, one person, until you all have your rights.\"",
      "Since then, social and political wins over time grew to encompass everyone represented by the acronym LGBTQ, which stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer. But that's become less true in recent years, as lawmakers in Tennessee, Texas and a number of other states repeatedly pushed legislation to restrict access to gender-affirming care, bathrooms and sports teams for transgender people.",
      "Anti-trans sentiment was central to President Trump's 2024 campaign, LGBTQ advocates say, and it followed him into office. Many of his directives this term have closely mirrored Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda that explicitly prioritizes eroding LGBTQ rights.",
      "A \"divide and conquer\" approach",
      "From health care bans, to sports bans, bathroom bans, a military ban and attempts to erase non-binary gender pronouns from the federal system, Mr. Trump's most conspicuous threats to LGBTQ rights specifically target trans people, a pattern that has drawn accusations of scapegoating from his critics, given that trans people make up an estimated 1% or less of the U.S. population.",
      "LGBTQ advocates also see it as a tactic to sow division in the community.",
      "\"Donald Trump ran for president on an age-old platform of divide and conquer,\" said Brandon Wolf, the national press secretary at the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBTQ advocacy organization. \"Inside the LGBTQ+ community, Donald Trump ran his campaign saying, I'm not targeting all LGBTQ+ people, just the trans people, and if you sacrifice that community, perhaps you will be spared.\"",
      "While polling data showed most LGBTQ voters didn't choose to elect him, Mr. Trump has gained increasingly loud support from a faction of gay conservatives who disavow the \"radical LGBT left\" and insist his policies aren't at odds with their personal freedoms.",
      "When the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration announced the upcoming termination of part of its 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline dedicated to helping LGBTQ youth, the gay conservative group Log Cabin Republicans called related media coverage \"fake news.\"",
      "On TikTok, a small but popular band of conservative gay influencers post videos to similarly defend Mr. Trump's record. \"Rights I've lost in Trump's America as a gay man,\" reads the caption of one of them, followed by an empty list numbered 1 through 5. In the comments section of another, a TikTok user responded to a thread outlining the current administration's anti-LGBTQ actions by saying, \"None of that has anything to do with us being gay.\"",
      "Trump's orders",
      "On Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump declared in his televised address to the American public that \"only two genders,\" male and female, would be recognized going forward by the federal government. He signed an executive order to enforce that within hours of being sworn in.",
      "Titled \"Defending Women From Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government,\" the wide-ranging order included instructions for the State Department to prohibit trans people from using gender markers that reflect their identities on official documents, like passports, and instead require that those markers align with the document holders' reproductive organs \"at conception.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration's passport policy attacks the foundations of the right to privacy and the freedom for all people to live their lives safely and with dignity,\" said Jessie Rossman, the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts, which has made headway in a lawsuit aiming to reverse the new rule, in a statement. \"We will continue to fight to stop this unlawful policy once and for all.\"",
      "Like many of Mr. Trump's executive orders, that one has faced steep challenges in the courts, and legal experts say its long-term applicability is uncertain as some elements contradict the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, which codified discrimination protections for all LGBTQ employees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The same conflict exists in Mr. Trump's orders to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, in which he instructed federal departments to \"correct\" what he called a \"misapplication\" of the Bostock ruling in their policies.",
      "Their uncertain futures aside, LGBTQ advocacy and rights groups feel those policies and others have already reaped consequences on the community at large \u2014 \"the predictable result,\" said Wolf, \"of a divide and conquer campaign.\"",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's directive to end \"radical indoctrination in K-12 schools,\" the Department of Defense banned books with themes involving gender identity, sexual orientation and race from its schools for children in military families, which receive federal funding, according to a separate lawsuit filed by the ACLU. A textbook focused on LGBTQ figures in American history was tossed out under the ban.",
      "Meanwhile, corporations scrambling to comply with anti-DEI orders eliminated or scaled back their partnerships with Pride celebrations around the country after Mr. Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center in February forced WorldPride organizers to regroup because events were either canceled or relocated from the venue. And, in May, the Human Rights Campaign issued a memo warning that Mr. Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" a \"skinny\" budget proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, would cut $2.67 billion in federal funding from programs that support LGBTQ people.",
      "Among its most urgent concerns were the administration's plans to significantly downsize public health programs for HIV/AIDS prevention as well as Justice Department programs that investigate anti-LGBTQ hate crimes, in addition to sweeping cuts to resources for the trans community.",
      "Asked where LGBTQ rights stand under the Trump administration, a White House spokesperson pointed to Mr. Trump's past appointments of openly gay judges and officials such as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, in addition to two initiatives during his first term to decriminalize homosexuality globally and end the HIV epidemic by 2030, although his 2026 budget proposal would hamper that.",
      "\"President Trump's historic reelection and the overall MAGA movement is a big tent welcome for all and home to a large swath of the American people,\" said the spokesperson, Harrison Fields, in a statement. \"The President continues to foster a national pride that should be celebrated daily, and he is honored to serve all Americans. The American people voted for a return to common sense, and the President is delivering on every campaign promise supported by 77 million voters and is ushering in our Golden Age.\"",
      "\"An anti-LGBTQ administration\"",
      "In addition to tangible policies, advocates say that attitudes toward LGBTQ people from the nation's highest office are contributing to higher incidences of violence against LGBTQ people and likely foreshadow harms still to come.",
      "\"Overall, it is clearly an anti-LGBTQ administration,\" said Sarah-Kate Ellis, the president and chief operating officer at the LGBTQ media organization GLAAD. \"And I think that they are consistently signaling that they want to roll back all of our hard-won rights.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and those in his orbit have repeatedly cast LGBTQ people and activities in a negative light. While announcing leadership shifts at the Kennedy Center in February, the president penned a social media post that pledged, in capital letters, to ensure the arts forum would no longer host drag shows \"or other anti-American propaganda.\" His press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, later said the country needs \"less LGBTQ graduate majors\" in an interview on Fox News criticizing Harvard University.",
      "According to advocates and academics, the administration frequently relies on political strategies to marginalize trans people that have been used against other groups in the past. The term \"groomers,\" for example, is a historically anti-gay trope, and \"gender ideology\" originally demonized feminism.",
      "There were also notable moments of silence from the Trump administration, which did not acknowledge Pride Month, even as a global Pride festival took place for several weeks between May and June in Washington, D.C. LGBTQ people say that wasn't necessarily a surprise after watching their visibility decline in national forums this year, starting with mentions of \"lesbian,\" \"bisexual,\" \"gay,\" \"transgender,\" \"sexual orientation\" and \"gender identity\" being scrubbed from the White House website the day after Mr. Trump's inauguration, in a flashback to his first term.",
      "References to trans people disappeared around the same time from the website for the Stonewall National Monument, considered the birthplace of gay liberation, in a move that sparked particular outcry. Marcia P. Johnson was among the pioneering trans activists who remain named on the site despite that change.",
      "Where do LGBTQ rights stand in America?",
      "Advocates for LGBTQ rights and others in the community say they're wary of what may come next. Echoing discourse that has persisted online since Mr. Trump's campaign, Ellis said she expects a right-wing push to overturn Obergefell v. Hodges, the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, is imminent.",
      "\"Our view on this is that they will continually attack our community and find any way to dismantle our community,\" she said, of the right-wing forces propelling Mr. Trump. \"They've only focused on trans people because they are such a small population and so marginalized. But they will go after our marriages. They will go after our families. It has always been the anti-LGBTQ movement at the center of this.\"",
      "At least nine state legislatures have introduced bills to reverse the Supreme Court's gay marriage ruling since Mr. Trump returned to Washington. Earlier this month, the Southern Baptist Convention voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution that calls for the same. LGBTQ advocates emphasize that marriage equality is settled law, and research from Gallup and GLAAD demonstrate that a vast majority of Americans continue to support it. But some still worry the path to overturning Obergefell could be akin to the one that led to the fall of Roe v. Wade, which kept abortion legal for 50 years before Trump-appointed justices tipped the Supreme Court bench and struck it down.",

      "Following the destructive storm, $15 billion was spent to reinforce a levy system designed to keep water out. New Orleans, much of which lies below sea level, relies on this elaborate system of levees, pumps and drainage canals.",
      "The study, published in the journal Science Advances, used satellite radar data to track shifts in ground elevation across the Greater New Orleans area between 2002 and 2020. It found that while most of the city remains stable, some neighborhoods, wetlands, and even sections of the region's post-Katrina flood protection system are sinking by more than an inch per year \u2014 with some areas experiencing up to 47 millimeters, or nearly 2 inches, of elevation loss annually.",
      "\"In a city like New Orleans, where much of the land is already near sea level, even minor drops in elevation can increase flood risk,\" said Simone Fiaschi \u2014 lead author of the study and a former researcher with Tulane's\u00a0Department of River-Coastal Science and Engineering, now employed at TRE-Altamira \u2014 in a statement.",
      "\"These results are a wake-up call,\" Allison said. \"We need ongoing monitoring and maintenance to ensure that our flood defenses don't lose their level of protection beneath us.\"",
      "If trends continue, and infrastructure is left unchecked, the study found wetlands east of the city could transform marshes into open water within the next 10 years if trends continue \u2014 effectively eliminating critical storm surge buffers to the Louisiana coast.",
      "The study also identified some potential causes of the sinking hotspots. It found pockets of land are sinking around industrial sites, the Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, and newer residential developments \u2014 areas where soil compression and groundwater withdrawal are likely contributors.",
      "Researchers said the findings also underscore a few potential solutions to better protect New Orleans and other coastal communities across the globe, including frequent upgrades to the flood protection system and satellite monitoring.",
      "Some residents living in the Michoud neighborhood on the city's east side \u2014 one of the areas identified in the study as sinking more rapidly than others \u2014 are concerned that maintenance won't be prioritized. Michoud   resident Synthia Viltus pointed out that potholes and other smaller infrastructure issues in her neighborhood have remained unresolved for months.",
      "\"I have zero faith in state federal leaders to keep the levies updated,\" Viltus said.",

This is especially true for critical areas like the floodwalls, where on-site verification was not possible during this project.\"",

The justices did not address the question of whether Mr. Trump's order is constitutional, and the administration has said agencies have 30 days to issue public guidance about implementation of the policy, allowing time for more challenges to be filed.",
      "\"Some say that the universal injunction 'give[s] the Judiciary a powerful tool to check the Executive Branch.' But federal courts do not exercise general oversight of the Executive Branch; they resolve cases and controversies consistent with the authority Congress has given them,\" Barrett wrote. \"When a court concludes that the Executive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for the court to exceed its power, too.\"",
      "In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor accused the majority of abdicating its role in protecting the rule of law. She read portions of her dissenting opinion from the bench.",
      "\"With the stroke of a pen, the president has made a 'solemn mockery' of our Constitution,\" she wrote. \"Rather than stand firm, the court gives way.\"",
      "At a White House news conference following the decision, Mr. Trump praised it as \"a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law.\"",
      "Universal injunctions and the birthright citizenship case",
      "The court's ruling came in a trio of emergency appeals by the Trump administration arising out of the president's executive order seeking to end the 14th Amendment's guarantee of birthright citizenship, which means that everyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The Justice Department had asked the Supreme Court to narrow the scope of three separate injunctions that blocked implementation of Mr. Trump's policy nationwide while legal challenges brought by 22 states, immigrants' rights groups and seven individuals moved forward.",
      "But instead of swiftly deciding whether to grant the Trump administration emergency relief, the Supreme Court held arguments on whether to restrict the use of nationwide, or universal, injunctions, which are judicial orders that prevent the government from enforcing a policy anywhere in the country and against anyone, including individuals who are not involved in the litigation before them.",
      "The dispute over the president's attempt to unwind birthright citizenship has become intertwined with the administration's battle against nationwide injunctions. These sweeping orders have frustrated both Democratic and Republican presidents seeking to implement their agendas among gridlock in Congress, and the fight over them has been simmering for several years.",
      "The Congressional Research Service identified 86 nationwide injunctions that were issued during Mr. Trump's first term and 28 granted while former President Joe Biden was in office. In Mr. Trump's second term, the Congressional Research Service found 17 nationwide injunctions were issued during the first 100 days, though the Trump administration estimated last month there have been far more \u2014 at least 40 of these orders, and most coming from the same five judicial districts.",
      "Some of the justices have suggested in past writings that the Supreme Court would have to clarify whether nationwide injunctions are allowed at all, and members on both ideological sides of the bench have been critical of them. The president and his allies have\u00a0attacked judges\u00a0for issuing nationwide injunctions in the slew of legal challenges to Mr. Trump's policies, and even called for\u00a0some to be impeached.",
      "The president's birthright citizenship order was one of the first that he signed on his first day back in office. While the 14th Amendment has for more than a century been understood to guarantee citizenship to all people born in the U.S., Mr. Trump's order denied birthright citizenship to children born to a mother who is unlawfully present in the U.S. or who is lawfully present on a temporary basis; or whose father is neither a citizen nor lawful permanent resident. The president directed federal agencies to stop issuing documents recognizing U.S. citizenship to children in those categories born after Feb. 19.",
      "More than half-a-dozen lawsuits challenging the measure were filed before it took effect, and three federal district courts in Washington, Maryland and Massachusetts each blocked the government from implementing the order. Federal appeals courts in California, Massachusetts and Virginia then refused requests by the Trump administration to partly block the lower court orders.",
      "The Justice Department filed emergency appeals of the three decisions with the Supreme Court in mid-March and asked it to limit enforcement of the birthright citizenship order to 28 states and individuals who are not involved in the cases. The administration said the Supreme Court should, at a minimum, allow agencies to develop and issue public guidance while proceedings continue, and took aim at the breadth of the injunctions issued by the district courts. Government lawyers said in a filing that universal injunctions have reached \"epidemic\" proportions since Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January.",
      "\"Those injunctions thwart the executive branch's crucial policies on matters ranging from border security, to international relations, to national security, to military readiness,\" Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote. \"They repeatedly disrupt the operations of the Executive Branch up to the Cabinet level.\"",
      "But the plaintiffs in the cases urged the Supreme Court to leave the district court orders in place. In a filing\u00a0of their own, officials from 18 states, the District of Columbia and San Francisco called the Trump administration's request \"remarkable,\" since it would allow the government to strip hundreds of thousands of American-born children of their citizenship while the legal challenges move forward and render them \"deportable on birth and at risk of statelessness.\"",
      "The states argued that the Trump administration seeks to violate binding Supreme Court precedent that recognized birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.",
      "The court's decision",
      "Writing for the majority, Barrett looked to the nation's history and said that nationwide injunctions were \"conspicuously nonexistent\" in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. If federal courts had such a tool, she said, \"surely they would not have let it lay idle.\"",
      "\"Nothing like a universal injunction was available at the founding, or for that matter, for more than a century thereafter. Thus, under the Judiciary Act, federal courts lack authority to issue them,\" she wrote.",
      "In her dissent, Sotomayor warned that the Supreme Court's new regime puts all manner of constitutional rights at risk and renders them \"meaningful in name only\" for people who are not parties to a lawsuit.",
      "\"Today, the threat is birthright citizenship,\" she wrote. \"Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship.\"",
      "Sotomayor accused the court's conservative majority of ignoring whether Mr. Trump's plan to end birthright citizenship is constitutional and said its \"patent unlawfulness\" underscores why universal injunctions are appropriate remedies.",
      "While the high court agreed to grant Mr. Trump's request for a partial stay of the injunctions, Barrett wrote that there are still issues for the lower courts to decide, including whether narrower relief is appropriate.",
      "The Supreme Court's decision still allows plaintiffs challenging a policy to file class-action lawsuits and seek certification of a nationwide class. In her dissent, Sotomayor urged individuals who may be impacted by Mr. Trump's birthright citizenship plan, as well as lower courts, to move swiftly.",
      "\"[T]he parents of children covered by the Citizenship Order would be well advised to file promptly class-action suits and to request temporary injunctive relief for the putative class pending class certification,\" she wrote. \"For suits challenging policies as blatantly unlawful and harmful as the Citizenship Order, moreover, lower courts would be wise to act swiftly on such requests for relief and to adjudicate the cases as quickly as they can so as to enable this Court's prompt review.\"",
      "On the heels of the Supreme Court's decision, CASA, one of the groups that challenged the order, asked the federal district court to allow its lawsuit to proceed on a classwide basis and certify as a class \"all children who have been born or will be born in the United States on or after February 19, 2025, who are designated by Executive Order 14,160 to be ineligible for birthright citizenship, and their parents.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration will revoke the legal status and work permits of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants in early September, arguing that conditions in Haiti have sufficiently improved for them to return home, the Department of Homeland Security announced Friday.",
      "The department said it would terminate Haiti's longstanding Temporary Protected Status program, which has allowed immigrants from the crisis-stricken Caribbean nation to live and work in the U.S. legally since 2010, following the devastating earthquake that year.",
      "If they don't qualify for another legal immigration status \u2014 like asylum or a green card \u2014 those who lose their TPS protections will become ineligible to work in the U.S. legally and eligible to be arrested and deported by federal immigration authorities.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday urged Haitians with TPS to voluntarily leave the U.S. by using a smartphone app that officials have converted into a system to facilitate self-deportations. The administration has warned immigrants in the U.S. illegally that if they don't self-deport, they will be found, arrested and forcibly deported.",
      "\"This decision restores integrity in our immigration system and ensures that Temporary Protective Status is actually temporary,\" DHS said in a statement. \"The environmental situation in Haiti has improved enough that it is safe for Haitian citizens to return home.\"",
      "The government estimates that there are 348,187 Haitians in the U.S. with TPS, according to\u00a0a DHS notice. The department said their TPS protections would lapse on Sept. 2.",
      "Created by Congress in 1990, TPS allows the federal government to offer migrants work permits and a reprieve from deportation if their home countries are engulfed in a crisis, such as a war or an environmental disaster.",

    "story": [
      "On Friday, the fight with U.S. higher education started by America's 47th president, Donald Trump, landed at the university founded by its third president, Thomas Jefferson.",
      "The University of Virginia's president, James E. Ryan, submitted his resignation Friday in an effort to resolve Trump administration demands related to a federal\u00a0investigation\u00a0into the school's diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "The move is the first such pressure campaign on a public university, which is the latest escalation in the Trump administration's months-long national effort to reshape higher education at America's top universities. The Justice Department Civil Rights Division pressured the university to uproot diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, as ordered by President Trump, and accused Ryan of simply rebranding them. Multiple sources familiar with the situation told CBS News that the university feared losing federal funding unless a compromise was reached. Ryan's resignation followed.",
      "In a letter to the UVA community, Ryan explained that he \"cannot make a unilateral decision to fight the federal government in order to save my own job.\" He nodded to a broad threat of federal action against the university and its students if he remained in office.",
      "\"To do so would not only be quixotic but appear selfish and self-centered to the hundreds of employees who would lose their jobs, the researchers who would lose their funding, and the hundreds of students who could lose financial aid or have their visas withheld,\" Ryan wrote.",
      "A spokesperson for the school said \"UVA is committed to complying with all federal laws and has been cooperating with the Department of Justice in the ongoing inquiries.\"",
      "\"The federal government's support of the University is essential to continue the core mission of research, education and, clinical care,\" said the spokesperson, Brian Coy. The New York Times first\u00a0reported\u00a0Ryan's intention to resign.",
      "A person familiar with the matter described the federal scrutiny as being like a \"nuclear bomb\" going off within the University of Virginia's administration.",
      "This source said lawmakers including senators urged Ryan not to resign and to remain in office until after the state's gubernatorial election concludes in November in case a Democratic candidate replaces Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. A future Democratic governor might then be positioned to challenge Mr. Trump's order, as well as to dismiss Youngkin's conservative appointees to the university's Board of Visitors. That Board voted in the Spring to follow Mr. Trump's orders to excise DEI programs. Youngkin is thought to have presidential aspirations and has embraced Mr. Trump's anti-DEI platform.",
      "If Democratic candidate for governor Abigail Spanberger were to defeat Republican Winsome Earle-Sears, she would be able to act to preserve Ryan's standing, they said.",
      "Ryan is known for his efforts to advance diversity both at the University of Virginia and in his previous role as dean of the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Harvard has also been a focus of Trump administration scrutiny, recently suing the federal government over its effort to bar it from admitting international students. Until now private universities, and specifically Ivy league schools had been the prime focus of the Trump administration's education litigation. Those efforts often cited efforts to combat accusations of anti-semitism on campus.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts have resulted in colleges nationwide, including Columbia University and the University of Michigan dramatically scaling back their diversity, equity and inclusion messaging and programs.",
      "The University of Virginia was designed and founded in 1819 by Jefferson. Education was central to his legacy, and he left explicit instructions for his gravestone to be inscribed with three accomplishments: author of the Declaration of independence, author of Virginia's statute of religious freedom, and Father of the University of Virginia. There was no mention of having been America's third president.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Friday struck down President Trump's executive order that sought to punish the law firm Susman Godfrey, ruling that it is unconstitutional and blocking the administration from enforcing it.",
      "The decision from U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan caps an unbroken streak of victories for the four major law firms that were targeted by Mr. Trump as part of his efforts to go after his perceived enemies and chose to challenge his directives in court, rather than commit millions of dollars in free legal services, as nine other firms have done.",
      "The president's executive orders aimed to sanction the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, and Susman Godfrey by going after their clients, access to federal buildings and employees, and security clearances held by their employees.",
      "Each of the four firms filed lawsuits arguing the orders violated the Constitution, and four different judges have skipped trials and ruled in their favor. The Trump administration has not appealed any of the decisions so far.",
      "AliKhan said in her ruling\u00a0that Mr. Trump's executive order regarding Susman Godfrey violated the First and Fifth Amendments. The order, she said, \"is unconstitutional from beginning to end.\"",
      "\"Here, the Order goes beyond violating the Constitution and the laws of the United States,\" the judge wrote. \"The Order threatens the independence of the bar \u2014 a necessity for the rule of law.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed the executive order targeting Susman Godfrey in April, which claimed that the firm \"spearheads efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.\"",
      "The firm, which has 350 employees, represented Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation lawsuit against Fox News. The suit was filed in response to unfounded claims aired by the network that Dominion helped rig the 2020 election against Mr. Trump. Fox News and Dominion reached a $787 million settlement agreement in 2023.",
      "The president's executive orders against the four law firms all sought to inflict similar harms, including by suspending active security clearances held by their employees, requiring government contractors to disclose any business with the firms and limiting government employees from engaging with their employees. The orders also restricted their access to federal buildings.",
      "Susman Godfrey, like the three others, sued the Trump administration shortly after the executive order was signed, arguing that it violated the First and Fifth Amendments. Lawyers for the firm said Mr. Trump's directive was \"unprecedented and unconstitutional\" and part of \"an express campaign of retaliation for representing clients and causes he disfavors or employing lawyers he dislikes.\"",
      "Indeed, Mr. Trump's executive order targeting Perkins Coie went after the firm for its representation of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 election and its hiring of a research firm that retained former British spy Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "His attempts to punish Jenner & Block and WilmerHale both invoked lawyers who worked on the Justice Department's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. At WilmerHale, that was Robert Mueller, the special counsel who led the probe, and two lawyers who worked on his team, Aaron Zebley and James Quarles. For Jenner & Block, the lawyer was Andrew Weissmann, who also worked on the Russian meddling case. Mueller, Quarles and Weissmann each left their firms several years ago.",
      "But the firms have also been involved in litigation challenging policies rolled out during Mr. Trump's second term. WilmerHale is representing\u00a0 a group of inspectors general who were fired by the president at the start of his administration, and Jenner & Block is involved in a challenge Mr. Trump's efforts to withhold federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to young people.",
      "Susman Godfrey continues to represent Dominion in defamation lawsuits arising out of baseless claims related to the 2020 election, including against Rudy Giuliani, conservative lawyer Sidney Powell and Newsmax.",
      "AliKhan, who was appointed to the district court by former President Joe Biden, had granted Susman Godfrey temporary relief in April and blocked the administration from enforcing parts of the executive order against the firm. Her final decision in favor of Susman Godfrey was not a surprise, since she had said at a hearing then that the executive order was \"based on a personal vendetta\" against the firm.",
      "\"The framers of our Constitution would see this as a shocking abuse of power,\" she said in April.",
      "While the four firms have each successfully had the executive orders invalidated, other major firms have decided to enter into agreements with the president, seemingly to avoid being targeted themselves.",
      "Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison was threatened with punishment in March, but Mr. Trump rescinded his executive order focusing on the firm after it committed to providing $40 million in pro bono work to support the administration's policies.",
      "Since then, eight more firms have reached deals with the White House that pledges of between $100 million and $125 million in free legal services. Mr. Trump has suggested using the law firms' promise of pro bono work to help the U.S. in trade negotiations over tariffs.",

      "The higher minimum wages come as the federal baseline rate remains at $7.25 an hour, where it's been parked since 2009.

      "In Washington, D.C., 7.5% of the workforce, or 62,200 workers, will benefit from the minimum wage rising by 45 cents to $17.95 an hour, thanks to an inflation adjustment formula.

    "story": [
      "Americans are continually encouraged to sock away money in a 401(k) or other retirement plan to ensure a comfortable, if not cushy, life in their later years. Yet about half of all U.S. workers in the private sector lack access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, a huge obstacle in building enough wealth to retire, a recent study finds.",
      "About 56 million workers at businesses across the U.S. are unable to save via a retirement plan through their jobs, according to the analysis from the Pew Charitable Trusts. And while these employees can in principle save money on their own, many are forced to prioritize putting food on the table and paying the bills in the present over building a nest egg for the future, the study found.",
      "The findings underscore the widening divide between the retirement haves and have-nots, with almost 30% of Americans over age 59 lacking any savings\u00a0to fall back on when they stop working. Employer-sponsored accounts like 401(k)s can help workers save because the money is taken out of paychecks automatically on a pre-tax basis, while many employers also provide a company match, which helps boost savings.",
      "\"Deeply unequal\"",
      "\"Pew's findings confirm what we've known for years: America's retirement system is deeply unequal,\" retirement expert Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist and professor at the New School for Social Research, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "She added, \"Nearly half of private sector workers \u2014 56 million people \u2014 lack access to workplace retirement plans. When we include gig, cash and many public-sector workers, the number grows to a staggering 83 million. That's not a gap \u2014 it's a crisis.\"",
      "About 70% of all U.S. retirement assets are held in employer-sponsored defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans, including 401(k)s and pensions, as well as in government-sponsored plans, the Congressional Research Service found in a 2023\u00a0analysis. The remainder is tucked away in individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.",
      "While it's possible to save for retirement without a 401(k), many workers without access to these plans said they faced barriers to building wealth, the Pew survey found. For instance, one-third of workers without access to an employer-sponsored retirement account said they didn't have any money left over after the end of the month.",
      "\"To build wealth and achieve financial security, individuals and families need a convenient and effective way to accumulate assets,\" Pew noted in its analysis. \"Research shows that individuals are 15 times more likely to save for retirement if money is deducted automatically from their paychecks.\"",
      "Other researchers have highlighted the gaping holes in the American retirement system. For example, one 2023 analysis from the Economic Innovation Group found that 70% of low-income workers, or those earning $37,000 or less, lack employer-sponsored plans.",
      "Creaking Social Security system",
      "While financial gurus often exhort Americans to prepare for the time they can no longer work, the Pew research makes clear that people without access to a retirement plan face significant hurdles to achieving financial security, Ghilarducci noted.",
      "\"What the Pew report confirms, and what we experts knew for years, is that saving for retirement isn't much about personal responsibility as it is about access,\" she said.",
      "Ghilarducci added, \"Without a workplace plan, even the most disciplined and financially educated worker faces structural disadvantages for saving.\"",
      "The Pew research underscores that millions of Americans will approach their retirement years reliant on Social Security as their primary \u2014 or even only \u2014 source of income in old age. At the same time, the Social Security program is on track to deplete its trust funds by 2034, one year sooner than previously forecast.",
      "At that point, roughly 70 million Social Security recipients would see their monthly benefits cut by about 20%. That would likely create financial hardship for the roughly 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who today rely on the program as their sole source of income.",
      "Although lawmakers still have time overhaul the program to strengthen its finances, Congress has yet to take steps to shore up Social Security.",
      "\"The Pew report is a wake-up call,\" Ghilarducci said. \"If Congress fails to act, the people most harmed are those who can least afford it \u2014 workers without retirement accounts and pensions, gig workers, and those earning low wages.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' goal of sending President Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" to his desk within the next week appears to be on shaky ground as the legislation runs into obstacles in the Senate, with changes that risk bleeding GOP support in the House.",
      "A day after Mr. Trump hosted an event at the White House to pressure lawmakers to pass the bill that includes tax cuts and funding for his border and national security priorities, the president signaled he's open to Republicans' self-imposed deadline slipping past July 4.",
      "\"It's important, it's not the end-all,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Friday about the deadline. \"We'd like to get it done by that time, if possible.\"",
      "Later in the day, Mr. Trump changed the goal posts again, posting on Truth Social that it \"must be ready to send it to my desk before July 4th.\"",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also acknowledged the date may slide past the holiday, but said \"I don't want to even accept that as an option right now.\"",
      "\"We'll see,\" Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota, said Friday afternoon when asked if Mr. Trump's initial comments on the timeline bought him more time to get the package through the Senate.",
      "Senators expect to begin voting on the bill Saturday, but have yet to release the final legislative text. The parliamentarian is continuing to determine which provisions comport with the rules governing the reconciliation process that allow Republicans to pass it with a simple majority.",
      "\"That's aspirational,\" Thune said about holding the first test vote midday Saturday, noting that they are still waiting on the parliamentarian to advise on a number of issues.",
      "The Senate leader also wasn't certain whether he had the votes to advance the legislation.",
      "\"We'll find out tomorrow,\" Thune said.",
      "House Democratic leadership issued guidance to members that votes are not expected over the weekend in the lower chamber and members would receive 48 hours notice before any potential votes next week.",
      "\"We can't make any of these final decisions until we see their bill,\" said Johnson. \"I'm going to give all of my members plenty of time to digest that. The House will not be jammed by anything. I made that commitment.\"",
      "Johnson said members would have 72 hours to review the legislation before a vote.",
      "The Senate parliamentarian's guidance has delivered several blows to key GOP provisions, including an effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from receiving Medicaid benefits and a plan to lower provider taxes, which states use to help fund their portion of Medicaid costs.",
      "Republicans have already struggled to reach a consensus on the provider tax as a handful of senators have expressed concern about the effects it could have on rural hospitals.",
      "Other recent ruled-out provisions include rolling back regulations on gun silencers, a religious carveout from an expansion of the college endowment tax, a $1,000 fee for anyone applying for asylum and fees on diversity immigrant visas.",
      "But Republicans can rework provisions that violate the rules and go back to the parliamentarian, Elizabeth MacDonough, with revised language.",
      "One such provision that received a green light from MacDonough was a revised plan to push some of the costs of food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program onto states. The benefits are currently funded by the federal government. The revision gives states more flexibility in calculating what their cost share requirement will be beginning in 2028.",
      "The parliamentarian also approved a revision on a proposal on a 10-year moratorium on state regulations on artificial intelligence. The updated provision provides federal aid to states as long as they do not regulate AI. According to Democrats on the Senate Budget Committee, the parliamentarian determined that the provision is in compliance \"as long as the conditions only apply to the new $500 million provided by the reconciliation bill.\"",
      "Meanwhile, House Republicans have drawn red lines on issues including the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, and clean energy tax credits. Blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support for the bill before it passed the House in May if the SALT cap was not increased from $10,000. They ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000.",
      "Johnson said he believed the blue-state Republicans would ultimately get on board with a proposal that would set the cap at $40,000 for five years and then revert back to $10,000.",
      "Republican Rep. Nick LaLota of New York said Friday he hasn't \"seen a deal to which I can say yes.\"",
      "Nikole  Killion, \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                      Jaala  Brown, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                      Ellis  Kim\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court ruled in favor of a group of parents who wanted to opt their children out of instruction with storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ruled in favor of a group of Maryland parents who challenged their school district's decision to deny them the ability to opt their elementary-aged children out of instruction featuring storybooks that address gender identity and sexual orientation.",
      "The high court said in a 6-3 decision\u00a0in the case of Mahmoud v. Taylor that the government burdens parents' religious exercise when it requires their children to participate in instruction that violates the families' religious beliefs. Justice Samuel Alito authored the majority opinion, with the three liberal justices \u2014 Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson \u2014 in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority said that the parents who brought the case are entitled to a preliminary injunction while their lawsuits proceed. The high court ordered the board to notify parents in advance when one of the story books at issue in the case will be used, and allow them to have their kids excused from the instruction.",
      "\"[W]e hold that the Board's introduction of the 'LGBTQ+-inclusive' storybooks \u2014 combined with its decision to withhold notice to parents and to forbid opt outs \u2014 substantially interferes with the religious development of their children and imposes the kind of burden on religious exercise\" that the court has previously ruled is unacceptable, Alito wrote.",
      "\"We reject this chilling vision of the power of the state to strip away the critical right of parents to guide the religious development of their children,\" Alito added later in the opinion.",
      "Sotomayor read her dissent aloud from the bench. In her opinion, she wrote, \"Simply being exposed to beliefs contrary to your own\" does not amount to prohibiting the free exercise of religion.",
      "\"The result will be chaos for this nation's public schools. Requiring schools to provide advance notice and the chance to opt out of every lesson plan or story time that might implicate a parent's religious beliefs will impose impossible administrative burdens on schools,\" Sotomayor wrote, later warning that it would force courts to resolve a \"new font\" of litigation and leave judges as the decision-makers on policies governing school material related to gender and sexuality.",
      "The Montgomery County Board of Education and Montgomery County Public Schools said in response to the decision that they are developing next steps and will provide further guidance to schools and families before the start of the next school year.",
      "\"This decision complicates our work creating a welcoming, inclusive, and equitable school system. It also sends a chilling message to many valued members of our diverse community,\" the board and school district said in a joint statement. \"Montgomery County Public Schools remains a welcoming and inclusive school system that embraces and celebrates each and every one of our students. We will maintain an environment where all students feel valued and supported.\"",
      "Mahmoud v. Taylor",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court came in one of three cases before the justices this term that involve religious rights. The high court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has in recent years been sympathetic to plaintiffs raising claims of religious discrimination.",
      "The dispute involves public-school instruction in Montgomery County, Maryland, which is home to the state's largest school system with more than 160,000 students. Montgomery County, like most states, had a policy that allowed parents with religious objections to classroom instruction or activities to excuse their children, as long as the opt-out requests did not become \"too frequent or burdensome,\" according to court filings.",
      "The Montgomery County Education Board added \"LGBTQ-inclusive\" storybooks into its English Language Arts curriculum for elementary school students after Maryland enacted rules seeking to promote \"educational equity.\" The school district said it wanted to supplement its Language Arts books with a handful of stories \"in order to better represent all Montgomery County families.\" The books added include titles like \"Born Ready,\" which is about a transgender elementary-aged child, and \"Prince & Knight,\" which tells the story of a prince who falls in love with and marries a knight.",
      "Both the majority and dissenting opinions included pages from the storybooks, though the justices disagreed as to their messages.",
      "Alito wrote that the books \"unmistakably convey a particular viewpoint about same-sex marriage and gender,\" and are \"designed to present certain values and beliefs as things to be celebrated and certain contrary values and beliefs as things to be rejected.\"",
      "But in Sotomayor's view, the books introduce readers to LGBTQ characters, but drawn on common themes presented to children in other works, such as overcoming difficulties, celebrating milestones or fairytale romances.",
      "The school board adopted the lessons in 2022 and allowed parents to opt their children out of reading and instruction involving the picture books. But in March 2023, it ended the policy and said families would no longer receive advance notice of when the books would be read, and would not be able to have their children excused from the instruction.",
      "The Board of Education had said that the opt-outs had become \"unworkable,\" since some schools had high numbers of absences. It said all faced \"substantial hurdles\" in using the books while honoring opt-out requests, as teachers had to manage the removal of excused students from class and plan alternative activities for them.",
      "That decision, though, sparked backlash throughout the community, with more than 1,000 parents signing a petition that called on the board to restore the opt-outs and dozens appearing at board meetings.",
      "Three Montgomery County families filed a lawsuit against the education board over the decision to end the opt-outs, arguing it violated their First Amendment right to free exercise of religion because it overrode their freedom to direct the religious upbringing of their children. The families are a diverse coalition of religions \u2014 Muslim, Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox.",
      "A federal district court in Maryland and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ruled for the school board, finding that there was no evidence that the families were compelled to violate their religious beliefs or conduct.",
      "The Supreme Court heard arguments in the case in late April.",

    "summary": "The incident occurred at Grand Prismatic Spring near Old Faithful as tourists were enjoying a close-up view of the famous and popular hot spring.",
    "story": [
      "A bison died after it appeared to stumble into a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park last week while visitors looked on.",
      "The incident occurred during the early morning of June 21 at Grand Prismatic Spring near Old Faithful as tourists were enjoying a close-up view of the famous and popular hot spring, according to witnesses and a spokesperson for Yellowstone.",
      "\"There were two bison (standing) there,\" said Louise Howard, who was visiting Yellowstone from Colorado for the first time. \"I thought it was a great photo opportunity.\"",
      "She told CBS News on Friday that one of the bison started walking toward the spring and appeared to step into a shallow part before quickly jumping out. She said that in a manner of about 30 seconds, the bison started walking but stumbled at the edge of the spring and fell in.",
      "\"As hard as it tried, it couldn't get out,\" said Howard, who shared photos on social media.",
      "Rare, but not unheard of",
      "Michael Poland, scientist-in-charge at the Yellowstone Volcano Observatory and a geologist with the U.S. Geological Survey, told CBS News on Friday it is not unprecedented that animals fall into hot springs. He said scientists have found skeletons at hot springs around the park, many of which are in the backcountry, not visited by tourists.",
      "\"There is one pool (in the Lower Geyser Basin) called Skeleton Pool,\" he said. \"What made this a little bit different is that it happened in summer, during the day, at one of the most popular tourist areas in the whole park.\"",
      "Poland said animals usually fall into the hot springs because they are walking too close to the edge and it collapses.",
      "\"There are thin crusts that form on the edges of these and so it's difficult to tell if there is boiling water directly beneath you,\" he said. \"What exactly happened in this case, it's impossible to say.\"",
      "\"There are animals that walk through that area all the time. When you walk on the boardwalk, you can look down into the water, and you can see all kinds of animal footprints \u2014 bison, elk, coyotes, so forth,\" Poland added.",
      "Nothing could have been done",
      "Poland said the bison died fairly quickly after falling into Grand Prismatic, where temperatures reach about 192 degrees Fahrenheit. The boiling point at Yellowstone is about 200 degrees Fahrenheit because of its high altitude.",
      "He said people can tell how hot the springs are based on the color of the bacteria near the edges.",
      "\"All those colorful edges on Grand Prismatic are different bacteria that live at different temperatures,\" he said. \"The red colors are bacteria that like warm water but not scalding and then as you go in from red to yellow to green, it gets to be hotter and hotter. And then the blue water, there is no bacteria there and that's the hottest water, and in many cases, that is really close to boiling.\"",
      "Poland dispelled rumors that the water in Yellowstone hot springs is highly acidic, saying that most springs in the park are actually neutral \u2014 just really hot.",
      "\"What's dangerous is the fact that they are very close to boiling,\" he said. \"Anyone who's poached a chicken knows what that will do to tissue.\"",
      "A cautionary tale for visitors",
      "Millions of tourists visit Yellowstone National Park each year \u2014 particularly in the busy summer season.",
      "This incident \u2014 and the two events of bison goring tourists this year\u00a0\u2014 are a cautionary tale for visitors who want to enjoy the park and everything it has to offer, Poland said.",
      "He urged people to stay on the boardwalks and follow the rules that Yellowstone's rangers have laid out for visitors.",
      "Yellowstone National Park is renowned for its diverse and abundant wildlife. Visitors commonly see bison, elk, bears and other animals, including wolves, moose, mountain goats and mountain lions.",
      "Anyone walking away from the boardwalks risks injury from the hot springs or wildlife but also risks damaging the landscape.",
      "\"The trails are there for a reason. We're in their environment,\" he said of the animals. \"It's a wild place. The landscape is wild too.\"",
      "Front row seat to nature",
      "Katie Kirtzel, from Utah, told CBS News on Friday that she and her family saw the animal's remains later in the day. She said it was about 7:15 p.m., very foggy and \"really eerie and mysterious\" when they spotted animal prints.",
      "\"There were bear tracks and bison tracks and we were taking pictures of those. And as we were following those tracks, the mist starts to clear a little bit and we see a big, large furry animal,\" she said. \"It was huge. You couldn't really tell what it was, but you could tell that something big had recently fallen into the spring.\"",
      "She said seeing the animal was a \"very profound\" and \"unique\" experience.",
      "\"My family and everybody else who was there was kind of taking in the moment, realizing that it was something really special that we walked on,\" Kirtzel said, adding: \"It's so cool to see the cycle (of life) in such an extreme way, right in front of your face.\"",
      "\"I really recommend people visit the park, and I certainly hope that if they do, they keep in mind that this is what we have the parks for,\" Kirtzel added. \"This is nature. This isn't something that's scary. This is something that is natural and incredible to experience if you do.\"",
      "Howard said that despite the tragic incident, the three days she spent at Yellowstone were some of the best of her life.",
      "\"You never get such a front row seat to nature,\" she said, adding: \"I think some people see Yellowstone as a zoo because of how they interact with the animals but it's not. Those animals are wild and they are doing their thing. We are guests in their area.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump praised the Supreme Court for its decision Friday limiting the ability of federal judges to impose nationwide injunctions, calling it a \"monumental victory for the Constitution.\"",
      "In comments at the White House, the president said, \"This morning, the Supreme Court has delivered a monumental victory for the Constitution, the separation of powers, and the rule of law in striking down the excessive use of nationwide injunctions to interfere with the normal functioning of the executive branch.\"",
      "The Supreme Court curbed the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges, a practice the president and his allies have railed against as blocking or hindering their agenda. In a\u00a06-3 decision\u00a0that stemmed from the president's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court said universal injunction orders likely exceeded the authority Congress has given the federal courts.",
      "Mr. Trump called the use of nationwide injunctions \"a grave threat to democracy, frankly.\"",
      "Thanks to this decision, the president said the administration can \"now promptly file to proceed with numerous policies that have been wrongly enjoined on a nationwide basis,\" including his effort to end birthright citizenship. Attorney General Pam Bondi predicted the Supreme Court would \"most likely\" rule on the merits of the birthright citizenship case during the next Supreme Court term, which begins this fall.",
      "Mr. Trump repeated a statement he often makes about birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment, saying that it's no longer being used as it was originally intended. \"Hundreds of thousands of people are pouring into our country under birthright citizenship, and it wasn't meant for that reason,\" he said. \"It was meant for the babies of slaves.\"",
      "The president thanked Barrett for writing the opinion \"brilliantly,\" and also the justices who sided with her.",
      "In the dissenting opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote, \"No right is safe in the new legal regime the Court creates. Today, the threat is to birthright citizenship. Tomorrow, a different administration may try to seize firearms from law-abiding citizens or prevent people of certain faiths from gathering to worship,\" and the court's ruling means that \"absent cumbersome class-action litigation, courts cannot completely enjoin even such plainly unlawful policies unless doing so is necessary to afford the formal parties complete relief.\"",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche also applauded other Supreme Court rulings, including a decision Friday to allow parents in a Maryland school district to opt their children out of storybooks based on objections to their approach to gender and sexuality.",
      "\"I think the ruling was a great ruling, and I think it's a great ruling for parents,\" the president said.",
      "The president addressed other topics beyond the Supreme Court rulings, too, including his administration's tariffs and his trade negotiations with other countries. Although the president indicated his administration is close to deals with several countries, he said at some point in the next week and a half, his administration will be sending letters to some countries \"and tell them what they have to pay.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday ordered further arguments over Louisiana's congressional map that was approved by the state's GOP-led legislature and created a second majority-Black district.",
      "An order from the court issued on the last day of its term restored the case to its calendar for reargument, with an additional scheduling order to come. Justice Clarence Thomas dissented from the move to order more arguments and said the court should have decided the case.",
      "The move means the state's map with two majority-Black districts remains intact for now.",
      "The district lines at the center of the dispute were invalidated in 2022 by a three-judge lower court panel, which sided with a group of self-described \"non-African-American voters\" who had challenged the House map as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The map wasn't the first crafted by the state's Republican-led legislature in the wake of the 2020 Census. Instead, Louisiana's efforts to redraw district lines, as all states do after the census, have resulted in a yearslong legal battle that has been before the Supreme Court twice before.",
      "The case demonstrated the challenges state lawmakers face when trying to balance complying with the Voting Rights Act without relying too much on race during the drawing the political lines, which can run afoul of the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court's decision is also likely to have implications for the balance of power in the House in the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will try to hold onto their razor-thin majority.",
      "The legal wrangling over Louisiana's congressional map has spanned several years and began after the state legislature redrew the six House districts in early 2022. A federal judge in Baton Rouge ruled that year that the map likely violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act because it diluted Black voting strength, and ordered the state to put a remedial plan in place that had two majority-Black congressional districts.",
      "That initial map had one majority-Black district and five majority-White districts, even though African Americans make up nearly one-third of Louisiana's population.",
      "The new map adopted by the state legislature reconfigured Louisiana's 6th Congressional District to bring the map into compliance with the Voting Rights Act, state lawmakers said. But they said they also had a second goal: to protect powerful Republican incumbents in the House, namely Speaker Mike Johnson, Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Rep. Julia Letlow. Letlow is the only woman in the state's congressional delegation and sits on the powerful Appropriations Committee, state officials noted.",
      "The new District 6 has a Black voting-age population of roughly 51% and stretches from Shreveport, in Louisiana's northwest corner, to Baton Rouge in the southeast, connecting predominantly Black communities along the way.",
      "But after the new voting lines were adopted, 12 \"non-African-American voters\" sued the state and alleged the reconfigured District 6 was a racial gerrymander that violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.",
      "A divided three-judge district court panel sitting in Shreveport agreed and said the legislature relied too much on race when it drew the new House district lines. Louisiana Republicans joined with Black voters and voting rights groups \u2014 who were on opposing sides in the challenge to the original map \u2014 to ask the Supreme Court to let the state use the new congressional map for the 2024 elections.",
      "The high court granted their request for emergency relief, and in November, Louisiana voters sent two Black Democrats to Congress. The Supreme Court then agreed to take up the case.",
      "The redistricting dispute is one of several the high court has been confronted with in recent years, and more continue to make their way to the justices. In a landmark 2013 ruling, the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, which required certain states and localities with a history of racially discriminatory voting practices to receive Justice Department approval before changing their election rules.",
      "Then, in 2019, the Supreme Court ruled that federal courts do not have a role to play in deciding legal fights over partisan gerrymandering, when state's voting lines are drawn to entrench the political party in power.",
      "But in an unexpected ruling in 2023, the Supreme Court declined an invitation to weaken Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the high court invalidated Alabama's congressional map crafted after the 2020 Census, which ultimately led to the election of the state's second Black House member.",

      "The ship will be named the USNS Oscar V. Peterson in honor of a Navy chief watertender who died in World War II and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, Hegseth said in a video posted to social media.",
      "Hegseth made the announcement ahead of the last weekend of Pride Month, the monthlong observance of the LGBTQ+ community that also coincides with the anniversary of the Stonewall uprising of 1969. Celebrations are expected this weekend in San Francisco, Chicago, New York and other cities.",
      "The USNS Harvey Milk was christened in 2021 during President Joe Biden's term. In Friday's social media video, Hegseth said that the ship's name change was made in line with \"taking the politics out of ship naming.\"",

      "\"People want to be proud of the ship they're sailing in,\" Hegseth said.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Navy was considering renaming the Harvey Milk and multiple naval ships named after civil rights leaders and prominent American voices.",
      "Milk was serving on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors when he and Mayor George Moscone  were\u00a0assassinated\u00a0in City Hall in 1978.

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of thousands of mourners lined the streets of downtown Tehran on Saturday for the funeral of the head of the Revolutionary Guard and other top commanders and nuclear scientists killed during a 12-day war with Israel.",
      "The caskets of Guard's chief Gen. Hossein Salami, the head of the Guard's ballistic missile program, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh and others were driven on trucks along the capital's Azadi Street as people in the crowds chanted: \"Death to America\" and \"Death to Israel.\"",
      "Salami and Hajizadeh were both killed on the first day of the war, June 13, as Israel launched a war it said meant to destroy Iran's nuclear program, specifically targeting military commanders, scientists and nuclear facilities.",
      "State media reported more than 1 million people turned out for the funeral procession, which was impossible to independently confirm, but the dense crowd packed the main Tehran thoroughfare along the nearly three-mile route.",
      "There was no immediate sign of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in the state broadcast of the funeral. Khamenei, who has not made a public appearance since before the outbreak of the war, has in past funerals held prayers for fallen commanders over their caskets before the open ceremonies, later aired on state television.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi was on hand, and state television reported that Gen. Esmail Qaani, who heads the foreign wing of the Revolutionary Guard, the Quds Force, and Gen. Ali Shamkhani were also among the mourners.",
      "Shamkhani, an adviser to Khamenei who was wounded in the first round of Israel's attack and hospitalized, was shown in a civilian suit leaning on a cane in an image distributed on state television's Telegram channel.",
      "Iran's Revolutionary Guard was created after its 1979 Islamic Revolution. Since it was established, it has evolved from a paramilitary, domestic security force to a transnational force that has come to the aid of Tehran's allies in the Middle East, from Syria and Lebanon to Iraq. It operates in parallel to the country's existing armed forces and controls Iran's arsenal of ballistic missiles, which it has used to attack Israel twice during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Over 12 days before a ceasefire was declared on Tuesday, Israel claimed it killed around 30 Iranian commanders and 11 nuclear scientists, while hitting eight nuclear-related facilities and more than 720 military infrastructure sites. More than 1,000 people were killed, including at least 417 civilians, according to the Washington-based Human Rights Activists group.",
      "Iran fired more than 550 ballistic missiles at Israel, most of which were intercepted, but those that got through caused damage in many areas and killed 28 people.",
      "Saturday's ceremonies were the first public funerals for top commanders since the ceasefire, and Iranian state television reported that they were for 60 people in total, including four women and four children.",
      "Authorities closed government offices to allow public servants to attend the ceremonies.",
      "Many in the crowd expressed feelings of anger and defiance.",
      "\"This is not a ceasefire, this is just a pause,\" said 43-year-old Ahmad Mousapoor, waving an Iranian flag. \"Whatever they do, we will definitely give a crushing response.\"",
      "State media published images of an open grave plot at Tehran's sprawling Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery where army chief of staff, Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, who was killed on the first day of the war, was to be buried beside his brother, a Guards commander killed during the 1980s Iran-Iraq war.",
      "Many of the others were to be buried in their hometowns.",
      "The Iranian judiciary's Mizan news agency confirmed that the top prosecutor at the notorious Evin prison had been killed in an Israeli strike on Monday.",
      "It reported that Ali Ghanaatkar, whose prosecution of dissidents led to widespread criticism by human rights groups, would be buried at a shrine in Qom.",
      "Iran has always insisted its nuclear program is only for peaceful purposes. But Israel views it as an existential threat and said its military campaign was necessary to prevent Iran from building an atomic weapon.",
      "Khamenei's last public appearance was June 11, two days before hostilities with Israel broke out, when he met with Iranian parliamentarians.",
      "On Thursday, however, he released a pre-recorded video, in his first message since the end of the war, filled with warnings and threats directed toward the United States and Israel, the Islamic Republic's longtime adversaries.",
      "The 86-year-old downplayed U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites as having not achieved \"anything significant\" and claimed victory over Israel.",
      "The head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency, Rafael Grossi, has characterized the damage done by American bunker-buster bombs to Iran's Fordo nuclear site, which was built into a mountain, as \"very, very, very considerable.\"",

      "The Sydney Project Dive Team, a group of trained divers who work to discover and document shipwrecks, conducted the first-ever dive to the SS Nemesis, a craft that sank in 1904 while carrying coal. All 32 people aboard the ship people died in the sinking, the dive team said. The ship sank on a stormy night, according to Australia's New South Wales Environment and Heritage agency. The sinking happened too quickly for lifeboats to be launched, the agency said.",
      "The shipwreck site was only discovered in 2022, the agency said. The wreck lies on the seafloor about 16 miles off the coast of Sydney. A remotely-operated vessel identified the ship as the Nemesis in 2023. But the depth of the wreck made learning more about it difficult. The Nemesis is about 525 feet underwater, the dive team and heritage agency said.",
      "The trip to the wreck was also chronicled in a detailed post by a dive team member.",
      "The mission to the site faced some obstacles. On June 7, the group gathered at 4 a.m. local time to try to dive to the site, but were hindered by stormy weather conditions. On June 18, weather conditions were clearer and allowed for divers to \"attempt one of the deepest technical wreck dives off the Australian coast,\" the dive team said.",
      "There is no light once divers get about 390 feet underwater, the dive team said. That meant the divers traveling to the Nemesis were working in complete blackness, following a line that had been dropped to the wreck. It took two tries to get the line in place and ensure the divers could safely follow it to the wreck.",
      "The divers were able to use lights to illuminate their work. There was crystal-clear visibility, the dive team said. The divers worked in two teams of two to survey the wreck, starting at its \"crushed and crumbled\" bow and traveling to the bridge, filming smoke stacks and other distinctive features. The team had just nine minutes to survey the shipwreck.",
      "There was coal scattered across the wreck site, the dive team said, but no artifacts like plates, cutlery or personal articles were visible. Photos also show fish and other sea life in the area.",
      "The most time-consuming part of the trip was the ascent to the surface, the dive team said. It took the divers six hours to slowly work their way to the surface and decompress safely.",
      "Another mission to the shipwreck site is being planned, the dive team said. That mission will involve completing a scan of the wreck to build on the information gathered by the remote vessel in 2023.",

    "summary": "Fifty-three migrants died in the back of an unairconditioned truck in 2022, marking the deadliest smuggling incident at the U.S.-Mexico border.",
    "story": [
      "Two smugglers convicted of federal charges in connection with the deaths of 53 migrants found in the back of a sweltering tractor-trailer in Texas in 2022 were sentenced to decades in prison on Friday.",
      "Felipe Orduna-Torres, 32, and Armando Gonzales-Ortega, 55, are to be the first of several defendants sentenced in the San Antonio tragedy, which remains the nation's deadliest human smuggling attempt across the U.S.-Mexico border. In March, a jury deliberated for\u00a0only about an hour before convicting the men of being part of a human smuggling conspiracy that resulted in death and injury.",
      "Orduna-Torres, who\u00a0prosecutors described\u00a0as the leader of the smuggling operation, was given two life sentences and an additional 20 years on a third count to be served consecutively, according to CBS affiliate KENS. Gonzales-Ortega was sentenced to 87.5 years in prison. Prosecutors had described Gonzales-Ortega as Orduna-Torres' top assistant.",
      "Both men were also fined $250,000.",
      "The 64 immigrants inside the truck had come from Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico and had paid between $12,000 and $15,000 each to be smuggled into the United States, according to an indictment in the case. They had made it as far as the Texas border city of Laredo when they were placed into a\u00a0tractor-trailer with broken air conditioning\u00a0for a three-hour drive to San Antonio.",
      "As the temperature rose inside the trailer, those inside screamed and banged the walls of the trailer for help or tried to claw their way out, investigators said. Most eventually passed out. When the trailer was opened in San Antonio, 48 people were already dead. Another 16 were taken to hospitals, where five more died. The dead included six children and a pregnant woman. Only 11 people inside the vehicle survived.",
      "In a news briefing shortly after the incident, San Antonio police chief William McManus described the scene as \"tragic beyond words.\"",
      "\"I don't understand how anyone could be so callous as to allow it happen and run from the scene,\" McManus\u00a0said.",
      "Orduna-Torres and Gonzales-Ortega were sentenced exactly three years after the tragedy.",
      "Investigators said the Orduna-Torres and Gonzales-Ortega worked with human smuggling operations in Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico, and shared routes, guides, stash houses, trucks and trailers. Orduna-Torres provided the address in Laredo where they would be picked up, and Gonzalez-Ortega met them there.",
      "Five other men previously pleaded guilty to felony charges in the smuggling case, including the truck driver\u00a0Homero Zamorano Jr., who was found hiding near the trailer in some bushes. Zamorano faces up to life in prison when sentenced in December. The other defendants are scheduled to be sentenced later this year.",
      "The incident is the deadliest among tragedies that have claimed thousands of lives in recent decades as people attempt to cross the U.S. border from Mexico.\u00a0Ten immigrants died in 2017\u00a0after they were trapped inside a truck parked at a Walmart store in San Antonio. In 2003, the bodies of 19 immigrants were found in a sweltering truck southeast of San Antonio.",

    "summary": "Trump administration announces $30 million in funding for the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which the U.N. calls a \"death trap\" for Palestinians.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that the Trump administration had approved $30 million in funding for the controversial, opaquely run private food distribution organization known as the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, which has been criticized by a United Nations agency as \"a death trap\" for hungry Palestinians in the war-torn enclave. It is the first U.S. government funding for the GHF confirmed by the Trump administration.",
      "Since it began operating in May, the GHF says it has distributed more than 46 million meals to Gazans, but its record has been marred by almost daily reports of civilians being killed trying to access its four \"distribution hubs.\"",
      "The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health said that as of Wednesday, 549 people had been killed near GHF hubs trying to access aid, and more than 4,066 others wounded. The United Nations has reported a lower death toll, saying that 410 people have been killed near the aid hubs.",
      "The GHF dismisses the Ministry of Health's figures as disinformation, and it says daily that nobody has been killed inside any of its hubs, while acknowledging incidents of violence outside the sites and referring to Israel's military for further information.",
      "\"We call on other countries to also support the GHF,\" State Department spokesperson Tommy Pigott said during a media briefing on Thursday, adding that the U.S. support, \"is simply the latest iteration of President Trump's and Secretary Rubio's pursuit of peace in the region.\"",
      "Pigott said he couldn't say whether the U.S. funds had already been handed over to the GHF.",
      "Asked about the pattern of near-daily reports of fatal shootings by Israeli forces around GHF distribution hubs, which the Israeli military says it is investigating, Pigott referred the reporter to the IDF to comment on its investigations, and added: \"Many of these reports are based on Hamas propaganda.\"",
      "Given his emphasis on the Trump administration's priority being the provision of more aid in Gaza, Pigott was asked repeatedly whether the U.S. would push Israel to allow other, well established humanitarian organizations to operate more freely inside the strip. He responded to that question multiple times by repeating his call for other countries to support the GHF.",
      "After being pushed by multiple reporters on the accusations that the GHF hubs are \"traps\" for Israeli forces to fire on civilians, Pigott said it was \"important to realize that Hamas bears sole responsibility for this conflict.\"",
      "Other humanitarian organizations, including U.N. agencies, have refused to work with the GHF, saying it operates in a way that dehumanizes Palestinians by forcing them to venture long distances for food, and citing repeated instances of violence around its distribution sites.",
      "\"Now is the time for unity and collaboration,\" the GHF said Friday. \"We look forward to other aid and humanitarian organizations joining us so we can feed even more Gazans, together.\"",
      "CBS News has requested in-person, on-camera interviews with GHF representatives repeatedly since the organization's creation was announced. GHF has yet to grant an interview.",
      "Criticism of GFH mounts, as it's labelled \"a death trap\" and a \"U.S. proxy\"",
      "The head of the U.N.'s agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA,\u00a0called the operation \"a death trap\" in a scathing statement earlier this week.",
      "There were new reports Friday of Palestinians being fired on near a GHF hub in southern Gaza, near the city of Rafah. An amateur video shared online by local Palestinian news organizations \u2014 which CBS News was not immediately able to independently verify \u2014 showed people laying on the ground for cover as bullets can be heard whizzing past. The video was shared with the caption: \"We are besieged by hunger from behind and death from ahead.\"",
      "The international charity Doctors Without Borders added its voice on Friday to the list of non-governmental organizations decrying the GHF,\u00a0calling the group a \"Israeli-U.S. proxy\" and a \"slaughter masquerading as humanitarian aid.\"",
      "\"The four distribution sites, all located in areas under the full control of Israeli forces after people had been forcibly displaced from there, are the size of football fields surrounded by watch points, mounds of earth and barbed wire. The fenced entrance gives only one access point in or out,\" MSF emergency coordinator in Gaza, Aitor Zabalgogeazkoa, said in the statement. \"If people arrive early and approach the checkpoints, they get shot. If they arrive on time, but there is an overflow and they jump over the mounds and the wires, they get shot. If they arrive late, they shouldn't be there because it is an 'evacuated zone', they get shot.\"",
      "\"It's unfortunate that MSF has joined the misinformation smear campaign by the Hamas-controlled Gaza Health Ministry,\" a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. \"Many of these alleged incidents were falsely linked to GHF sites when in fact they occurred near other humanitarian convoys or distribution locations.\"",
      "The spokesperson did not reply to a CBS News' question about whether the GHF was created or operates in direct conjunction with the U.S. or Israeli governments.",
      "The Israeli newspaper Haaretz added further weight to the accusations about violence around GHF hubs in an article published Friday, saying it had been told by some anonymous IDF personnel of a deliberate policy to shoot at crowds near GHF distribution sites. One soldier was quoted as saying he had been deployed near a GHF hub, and he described the situation as \"a killing field.\"",
      "\"Where I was stationed, between one and five people were killed every day,\" the soldier told Haaretz, which has long been critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. \"They're treated like a hostile force \u2014 no crowd-control measures, no tear gas \u2014 just live fire with everything imaginable: heavy machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars. Then, once the center opens, the shooting stops, and they know they can approach. Our form of communication is gunfire.\"",
      "\"We strongly reject the accusation raised in the article,\" the IDF told CBS News in a statement on Friday. \"The IDF did not instruct the forces to deliberately shoot at civilians, including those approaching the distribution centers. To be clear, IDF directives prohibit deliberate attacks on civilians.\"",
      "The military said it was \"operating to allow and facilitate the distribution of humanitarian aid by the American 'Gaza Humanitarian Foundation' (GHF), and to secure the routes leading to the distribution centers, in order to allow the aid to reach the civilians rather than Hamas.\"",
      "The IDF added that its forces were \"conducting systematic learning processes aimed at improving the operational response in the area (around GHF hubs) and minimizing, as much as possible, potential friction between the civilian population and IDF forces. As part of this effort, IDF forces have recently taken steps to reorganize the area, including the installation of new fencing, signage, the opening of additional routes, and more.\"",
      "It said recent reports of civilians being harmed approaching GHF hubs were \"being examined by the relevant IDF authorities\" and that \"any allegation of a deviation from the law or IDF directives will be thoroughly examined, and further action will be taken as necessary.\"",
      "In a joint statement on Friday, Netanyahu and Israel's Defense Minister Israel Katz also said the \"State of Israel strongly rejects the despicable blood libels published in the newspaper 'Haaretz.'\"",
      "In response to the Haaretz article, a GHF spokesperson told CBS News on Friday that there had \"been no incidents or fatalities at or in the immediate vicinity of any of our distribution sites. However, IDF is tasked with providing safe passage for aid-seekers to all humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza, including GHF. GHF is not aware of any of these incidents but these allegations are too grave to ignore and we therefore call on Israel to investigate them and transparently publish the results in a timely manner.\"",
      "GHF boss dismisses criticism as \"disinformation\"",
      "GHF executive chairman Johnnie Moore, an evangelical preacher twice appointed by President Trump as a White House adviser on religious freedoms, told Britain's Sky News on Friday that there was a \"disinformation campaign\" that is \"meant to shut down our efforts\" in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing,\" he said, adding that the \"U.S. endorsement of the effort is Exhibit A that it is actually working, despite the disinformation campaign that is very, very deliberate, meant to shut down our efforts.\"",
      "Moore suggested that violence could not be avoided around its hubs in Gaza, as the small, densely populated Palestinian territory remains an active warzone.",
      "Sky cited a U.N. figure of 410 people killed near aid hubs in Gaza, slightly lower than the figure provided by the health ministry.",
      "In a social media post after his interview with Sky, Moore said that \"some associated with the UN (& others) are knowingly sharing info that cannot be independently verified, & they're doing so solely for political purposes\u2026 while claiming impartiality. GHF is not political. It just has one mission: feed Gaza.\"",
      "\"The key piece of disinformation is, every single day, some figure comes out from the Gaza Health Ministry. It's normally shared with a network like Al-Jazeera, and it sort of like, goes around the world,\" he told Sky, when asked specifically what disinformation he was referring to.",
      "Moore drew a distinction between the GHF's operations and those of the Israel military.",
      "\"The difference between, you know, what happens when the IDF is involved in an incident \u2014 and we're not denying that there have been those incidents, there have been those incidents \u2014 but we're able to talk to the IDF, the IDF does an investigation, and the IDF is a professionalized military,\" Moore said. \"Hamas is intentionally harming people for the purpose of defaming what we're doing.\"",
      "The IDF has issued repeated statements after reports of troops firing on unarmed Palestinian civilians seeking aid, saying it has launched investigations. The results of any investigations related to incidents near GHF hubs have yet to be made public by the IDF.",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed.\"",
      "A number of Palestinians have told CBS News' team in Gaza about experiences of violence near GHF distribution sites.",
      "In early June, the family of Reem Akhras, a mother of eight, told CBS News' team in Gaza at her funeral that she was shot on her way to retrieve an aid parcel from a GHF hub.",
      "\"You went to get us food, Mom,\" Akhras' young daughter cried, sobbing over her body. \"We will never forgive them.\"",
      "\"They go to get food, but end up being killed,\" a man at Gaza's Nasser Hospital \u2014 where many of the injured were taken after an incident near a GHF hub in southern Gaza this week \u2014 told CBS News. \"They come with empty bags, and the American security company along with the Israeli army, they shoot these young men.\"",
      "The man said 30 people were killed on that day trying to reach the GHF hub.",
      "\"I tell everybody: Don't go. I send a message to all those young men: Do not go. Families should not send their children. Those who go will die. It's a trap. Stop going there. And if your son insists on going, break his legs. Do not go there.\"",
      "Another man at the hospital told CBS News that people have died \"in every family. They were just going to get food. They are hungry, grieving. They've got nothing to eat. Nothing to drink. There's no life. No safety. There's none of that in Gaza.\"",
      "The man said he wished the rest of the world could understand the suffering of people in Gaza.",
      "\"Young men in their prime are dying. What brings these youngsters to go to the aid sites? It's hunger. The fire of hunger has ravaged the people.\"",
      "GHF declines to reveal other backers",
      "Asked why the GHF was not being more transparent about its funding, organization and management, Moore declined to give further information about those matters, instead noting the group's daily press release to news organizations that lists the number of meals it says it has distributed and other \"operations on the ground.\"",
      "The GHF has been surrounded by controversy from the moment it commenced operations in mid-May. Just days after it launched its operation in Gaza, the group's first executive director, American Jake Wood,\u00a0announced his resignation, saying it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF then said it was winding down its operation in Switzerland after Swiss authorities said it was breaching rules for foundations registered in that country.",
      "GHF told CBS News at the time that henceforth, its only operations would be based out of the United States.",
      "\"We're saying everything we can, every single day, and by the way, we promise to do more of that,\" Moore said on Friday when pressed by Sky News about where the organization's funding comes from and what other entities it works with directly. \"One of the reasons we haven't released some pieces of information is because of this amazing, amazing opposition to any effort whatsoever to do this differently.\"",
      "Moore repeated the GHF's insistence that only its method of aid distribution in Gaza was viable, as the only other way meant that \"virtually every piece of aid that comes into the Gaza Strip is immediately taken by armed gangs, by Hamas.\"",
      "Other aid agencies, and officials in the Hamas-run enclave, acknowledge that looting does happen, but they refute claims of large-scale aid theft or diversion, saying the primary challenge to distributing food in Gaza is Israeli forces not permitting those operations.",
      "On June 11, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee was asked by CBS News' partner network BBC News if the State Department was funding GHF.",
      "\"It is not currently being funded largely by the U.S.,\" he said at the time. \"There are other countries, there are NGOs, there are humanitarian funds, and there are private individuals who have funded it, all of which have requested to remain anonymous. I think they don't want to become the targets of the hate that has befitted those who have tried to do something positive in what is a very difficult situation.\"",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. and China have agreed on the framework for a trade deal, both nations say.",
      "President Trump said at a White House event Thursday that Washington and Beijing had signed an agreement on trade, adding that he expects to have a deal with India soon. But Beijing and the White House later referred to the development as an agreement on the framework for a deal.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg TV the deal was signed earlier this week. Neither Lutnick nor Mr. Trump provided any details about the accord.",
      "\"We just signed with China the other day,\" the president said.",
      "Lutnick said the deal was \"signed and sealed\" two days earlier.",
      "Rare earth minerals apparently at center stage",
      "It was unclear if the latest accord was different from the one Mr. Trump announced two weeks earlier that he said would make it easier for American industries to obtain much-needed magnets and rare earth minerals. That pact cleared the way for the trade talks to continue, while the U.S. agreed to stop trying to revoke visas of Chinese nationals on U.S. college campuses.",
      "China's Commerce Ministry said Friday that the two sides had \"further confirmed the details of the framework.\" But its statement didn't explicitly mention U.S. access to rare earths, minerals essential for hi-tech products such as defense equipment, electric vehicles and hard drives. China dominates world production of those minerals.",
      "\"China will approve the export applications of controlled items that meet the conditions in accordance with the law. The United States will cancel a series of restrictive measures taken against China accordingly. It is hoped that the United States and China will meet each other halfway,\" the ministry said.",
      "The agreement follows initial talks in Geneva in early May that led both sides to postpone massive tariff hikes that were threatening to freeze much trade between the two countries. Later talks in London set a framework for negotiations and the deal mentioned by Mr. Trump appeared to formalize that agreement.",
      "A White House official told CBS News Thursday that the Trump administration and China had \"agreed to an additional understanding for a framework to implement the Geneva agreement.\"",
      "That clarification came after the Trump announcement of a \"deal\" at the White House event, at which he urged Republican lawmakers to approve the mammoth tax and budget bill before Congress.",
      "China hasn't announced any new agreements, but said earlier this week that it was speeding up approvals of exports of rare earths. Beijing's limits on rare earths exports have been a key point of contention.",
      "The Chinese Commerce Ministry said Thursday that Beijing was accelerating review of export license applications for rare earths and had approved \"a certain number of compliant applications.\"",
      "Export controls of the minerals apparently eclipsed tariffs in the latest round of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington after China imposed permit requirements on seven rare earth elements in April, threatening to disrupt production of cars, robots, wind turbines and other high-tech products in the U.S. and around the world.",
      "Fentanyl another key in the trade talks",
      "China also has taken steps recently on the fentanyl issue, announcing last week that it would designate two more substances as precursor chemicals for fentanyl, making them subject to production, transport and export regulations. Mr. Trump has demanded that Beijing do more to stop the flow of such precursor ingredients to Mexican drug cartels, which use them to make fentanyl for sale in the U.S. He imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese imports over the fentanyl issue, the biggest part of current 30% across-the-board taxes on Chinese goods.",
      "The agreement struck in May in Geneva called for both sides to scale back punitive tariff hikes imposed as Mr. Trump escalated his trade war and sharply raised import duties. Some higher tariffs, such as those imposed by Washington related to the trade in fentanyl and duties on aluminum and steel, remain in place.",
      "U.S., China economies both feeling trade disputes' effects",
      "The rapidly shifting policies are taking a toll on both of the world's two largest economies.",
      "The U.S. economy contracted at a 0.5% annual pace from January through March, partly because imports surged as companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before Mr. Trump could impose tariffs on them.",
      "In China, factory profits sank more than 9% from a year earlier in May, with automakers suffering a large share of that drop. They fell more than 1% year-on-year in January-May.",
      "Mr. Trump and other U.S. officials have indicated they expect to reach trade deals with many other countries, including India.",

      "Scientists have identified what could be the oldest rocks on Earth from a rock formation in Canada.",
      "The Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt has long been known for its ancient rocks - plains of streaked gray stone on the eastern shore of Hudson Bay in Quebec. But researchers disagree on exactly how old they are.",
      "Dispute apparently settled",
      "Work from two decades ago suggested the rocks could be 4.3 billion years old, placing them in the earliest period of Earth's history. But other scientists using a different dating method contested the finding, arguing that long-ago contaminants were skewing the rocks' age and that they were actually slightly younger \u2014 at 3.8 billion years old.",
      "In the new study, researchers sampled a different section of rock from the belt and estimated its age using the previous two dating techniques - measuring how one radioactive element decays into another over time. The result: The rocks were about 4.16 billion years old.",
      "The different methods \"gave exactly the same age,\" said study author Jonathan O'Neil with the University of Ottawa.",
      "The new research was published Thursday in the journal Science.",
      "Ancient rocks could shed light on Earth's earliest days",
      "Earth formed about 4.5 billion years ago from a collapsing cloud of dust and gas soon after the solar system existed. Primordial rocks often get melted and recycled by Earth's moving tectonic plates, making them extremely rare on the surface today. Scientists have uncovered 4 billion-year-old rocks from another formation in Canada called the Acasta Gneiss Complex, but the Nuvvuagittuq rocks could be even older.",
      "Studying rocks from Earth's earliest history could give a glimpse into how the planet may have looked - how its roiling magma oceans gave way to tectonic plates - and even how life got started.",
      "\"To have a sample of what was going on on Earth way back then is really valuable,\" said Mark Reagan with the University of Iowa, who studies volcanic rocks and lava and was not involved with the new study.",
      "Inuit community wants steps to avoid rocks being exploited",
      "The rock formation is on tribal Inukjuak lands and the local Inuit community has temporarily restricted scientists from taking samples from the site due to damage from previous visits.",
      "After some geologists visited the site, large chunks of rock were missing and the community noticed pieces for sale online, said Tommy Palliser, who manages the land with the Pituvik Landholding Corp. The Inuit community wants to work with scientists to set up a provincial park that would protect the land while allowing researchers to study it.",
      "\"There's a lot of interest for these rocks, which we understand,\" said Palliser, a member of the community. \"We just don't want any more damage.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 27 Jun 2025 07:40:42 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has repeatedly said that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated\" and the program was set back by years.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some Senate Democrats cast doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities after top officials briefed senators Thursday.",
      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges. And if they still have enriched uranium and they still have the ability to use centrifuges, then you're not setting back the program by years. You're setting back the program by months.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that the administration jumped to a conclusion too soon.",
      "\"Listen, I hope that is the final assessment,\" Warner said. \"But if not, does that end up providing a false sense of comfort to the American people?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he did not receive adequate answers about whether the nuclear stockpile was obliterated.",
      "\"What was clear is that there was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear weapon,\" Schumer said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said only a final battle damage assessment confirming the assertions \"would enable us to be comfortable or complacent about what has been done.\"",
      "\"The point is, we don't know. Anybody who says we know with certainty is making it up because we don't have a final battle damage assessment,\" he said. \"I think 'obliterated' is much too strong of word because it implies that it couldn't be reconstituted or somehow it was completely eliminated.\"",
      "Still, Blumenthal praised the military action as \"one that will go down in the annals of military history.\"",
      "\"Certainly, this mission was successful insofar as it extensively destroyed and perhaps severely damaged and set back the Iranian nuclear arms program. But how long and how much really remains to be determined by the intelligence community itself,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stood behind the administration's characterization, but acknowledged that Iran's capabilities could eventually be restored.",
      "\"The real question is, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear weapon,\" Graham said after the classified briefing. \"I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or obliterated. It was. But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it's not.\"",
      "Graham said he believed the program had been set back by years. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he was confident \"it's been set way back \u2014 a year, at minimum.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the strikes \"effectively destroyed Iran's nuclear program.\" Cotton added that the initial assessment had several intelligence gaps and \"assumed the worst-case scenario with perfect conditions in Iran.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said.",
      "Ratcliffe was among those who briefed senators Thursday, along with Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.",
      "The briefing had been initially scheduled for Tuesday but was delayed two days, upsetting some Democrats who demanded immediate transparency about the strikes after they were initially left in the dark about the military action.",

    "summary": "Takahiro Shiraishi was executed for the killings in 2017 of nine victims, most of whom had posted suicidal thoughts on social media.",
    "story": [
      "Japan on Friday executed a man dubbed the \"Twitter killer\" who murdered and dismembered nine people he met online, in the nation's first enactment of the death penalty since 2022.",
      "Takahiro Shiraishi, 34, was hanged for killing his young victims, all but one of whom were women, after contacting them on the social media platform now called X.",
      "He had targeted users who posted about taking their own life, telling them he could help them in their plans, or even die alongside them.",
      "According to the BBC, his Twitter profile contained the words: \"I want to help people who are really in pain. Please DM [direct message] me anytime.\"",
      "He killed the three teenage girls and five women after raping them. He also killed the boyfriend of one of the women to silence him, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Justice Minister Keisuke Suzuki said Shiraishi's crimes, carried out in 2017, included \"robbery, rape, murder ... destruction of a corpse and abandonment of a corpse.\"",
      "\"Nine victims were beaten and strangled, killed, robbed, and then mutilated with parts of their bodies concealed in boxes, and parts discarded in a garbage dump,\" Suzuki told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Nine dismembered bodies were found in coolers and tool boxes when officers visited his flat, which was dubbed by media outlets as a \"house of horrors,\" the BBC reported.",
      "Shiraishi acted to satisfy \"his own sexual and financial desires\" and the murders \"caused great shock and anxiety to society,\" Suzuki said.",
      "\"After much careful consideration, I ordered the execution.\"",
      "Japan and the United States are the only two G7 countries to still use capital punishment, and there is strong support for the practice among the Japanese public, surveys show.",
      "There was one execution in 2022, three in 2021, three in 2019 and 15 in 2018, the justice ministry told AFP.",
      "Shiraishi was sentenced to death in 2020 for the murders of his nine victims, aged between 15 and 26.",
      "After luring them to his small home near the capital, he stashed parts of their bodies around the apartment in coolers and toolboxes sprinkled with cat litter in a bid to hide the evidence.",
      "His lawyers had argued Shiraishi should receive a prison sentence rather than be executed because his victims had expressed suicidal thoughts and so had consented to die.",
      "But a judge dismissed that argument, calling Shiraishi's crimes \"cunning and cruel,\" reports said at the time.",
      "\"The dignity of the victims was trampled upon,\" the judge had said, adding that Shiraishi had preyed upon people who were \"mentally fragile.\"",
      "The grisly murders were discovered in autumn 2017 by police investigating the disappearance of a 23-year-old woman who had reportedly tweeted about wanting to kill herself.",
      "Her brother gained access to her Twitter account and eventually led police to Shiraishi's residence, where investigators found dismembered body parts.",
      "Executions in Japan",
      "Executions are always done by hanging in Japan, where around 100 death row prisoners are waiting for their sentences to be carried out.",
      "Nearly half are seeking a retrial, Suzuki said Friday.",
      "Executions are carried out in secrecy, where prisoners are not even informed of their fate until the morning of their hanging, according to the AP.",
      "Japanese law stipulates that executions must be carried out within six months of a verdict after appeals are exhausted.",
      "In reality, however, most inmates are left on tenterhooks in solitary confinement for years, and sometimes decades.",
      "There is widespread criticism of the system and the government's lack of transparency over the practice.",
      "Shiraishi's execution was the first under Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's administration, the Japan Times reported.",
      "In 2022, Tomohiro Kato was hanged for an attack that killed seven people in 2008, when he rammed a rented two-ton truck into a crowd in Tokyo and went on a stabbing spree.",
      "The high-profile executions of the guru Shoko Asahara and 12 former members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult took place in 2018.",

      "Schifrin's son, Ryan Schifrin, confirmed the death to CBS News in a statement, saying his father \"succumbed to complications from pneumonia.\"",
      "\"His family was at his side, and he passed peacefully,\" Schifrin said. \"We are grateful for the opportunity to be there for him. We are still trying to process this loss, and are very moved by all the love and support we have received.\"",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \"Cool Hand Luke,\" \"The Fox,\" \"Voyage of the Damned,\" \"The Amityville Horror\" and \"The Sting II.\"",
      "\"Every movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \"The movie dictates what the music will be.\"",

The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",

      "Schifrin's composition of the \"Mission: Impossible\" theme",
      "But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television's \"Mission: Impossible,\" which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \"only the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\" by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song, but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\"The producer called me and told me, 'You're going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it's going to start with a fuse,'\" Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \"So I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that's why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\"",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin's music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin's music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\"I remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\" Giacchino told NPR. \"And I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, 'Just have fun with it.' And I did.\"",
      "\"Mission: Impossible\" won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",

      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",

      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965's \"Jazz Suite on the Mass Texts\" while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV's \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \"Tango,\" \"Rush Hour\" and its two sequels, \"Bringing Down The House,\" \"The Bridge of San Luis Rey,\" \"After the Sunset\" and the horror film \"Abominable.\"",
      "Writing the arrangements for \"Dirty Harry,\" Schifrin decided that the main character wasn't in fact Clint Eastwood's hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\"You would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\" he told the AP. \"I wrote a theme for Scorpio.\"",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\"Receiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\" Schifrin said at the time. \"It is mission accomplished.\"",
      "Among Schifrin's conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra.

      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \"Letters from Argentina,\" nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",

      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \"Songs of the Aztecs.\" The work premiered at Mexico's Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site's Aztec temple.",
      "\"I found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\" Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \"But the real answer is that there's something magic about it. ... There's something magic in the art of music anyway.\"",

      "\"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" a message posted Thursday on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's X account declared. Another post added the bold claim that Israel's government \"was practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "In a recorded video address to his nation \u2014 his first public remarks since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire with Israel took effect on Tuesday \u2014 Khamenei went further, suggesting a \"large number of military and other targets\" in Israel had been targeted by Iran's missiles.",
      "They may have been targeted, but in reality, Iran's 12 days of missile launches saw relatively few rockets evade Israel's air defenses. A total of 28 people were killed, and none of them have been identified as government officials, but rather civilians killed when missiles struck apartment buildings and cities.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran killed at least 30 military commanders, on the other hand, and, in combination with the U.S. strikes over the weekend, \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear program, according to President Trump. The U.S.-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran, which relies on a network of sources in the country, said Wednesday that the strikes had killed at least 1,054 people in Iran, including a total of 318 military personnel.",
      "Khamenei also claimed Iran had given \"the U.S. a big slap in the face\" by attacking the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is home to thousands of American forces.",

      "Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani met with CBS News at her offices in Tehran on Thursday and said Iran would continue to pursue its nuclear program.",
      "\"We had no intention to move towards a nuclear bomb,\" Mohajerani said. \"It's Israel that has 90 nuclear warheads, but we did not want to go that way. Nonetheless, we will obtain the scientific knowledge to do what we want with our program.\"",

      "While full assessments of the damage inflicted are still being compiled, the heads of two U.S. intelligence agencies said Wednesday that\u00a0\"new\" intelligence indicated\u00a0the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was likely set back by \"years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Wednesday that the country's own intelligence assessment showed Iran's nuclear program was put back \"many years.\"",
      "Khamenei offered a very different take on Thursday \u2014 again, without any specifics or evidence. He claimed the U.S. had joined in Israel's strikes \"as it felt if it did not do so, the Zionist regime would get totally annihilated, so they entered the war to prevent this.\"",
      "\"They did not manage to do anything important to our nuclear facilities,\" he claimed, adding that Mr. Trump had \"overplayed the whole thing.\"",
      "Mohajerani on Thursday acknowledged to CBS News that the nuclear sites targeted by the U.S. strikes \"have been seriously damaged,\" adding, \"Any further reports should come from technical experts in the field.\"",
      "When pressed on the possibility the sites were completely destroyed, Mohajerani responded: \"I want to stress that these facilities have been seriously damaged. However, we must wait for the reports of our technical experts and specialists.\"",
      "Iran, in the wake of the ceasefire, has adopted legislation that will effectively forbid the country's government from cooperating in any way with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency has for decades been the only outside entity given access to Iran's nuclear facilities, for monitoring purposes, and it has experts still in the country.",
      "Iranian state media said Thursday that the legislation was approved by the senior clerics of the Guardian Council and thus had the \"weight of law.\" Khamenei, who has the ultimate say on all matters in Iran, did not mention the IAEA in his video address on Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told a\u00a0French news podcast that the agency's assessment, based largely on photographic evidence and its unique and deep familiarity with Iran's nuclear sites, was that the U.S. and Israeli strikes had caused \"very significant physical damage to three sites: Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordo, where Iran had concentrated most of its activities related to uranium enrichment and conversion.\"",
      "He said he was still in communication with senior Iranian officials and had suggested a meeting with the country's foreign minister, \"to begin evaluating the arrangements for the [IAEA] inspectors' return to the [nuclear] sites.\"",
      "Grossi said he had yet to receive any reply, noting \"some tension right now\" between the agency and Iran's leadership, given \"political voices in Iran who believe the agency hasn't been impartial.\"",
      "The IAEA chief said he was \"enormously\" concerned by the Iranian government's decision to halt cooperation with the IAEA.",
      "\"The agency's presence in Iran is not some kind of generous gesture. It is an international responsibility. Iran is a member of the\u00a0Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore must have an inspection system. It is a legal obligation from the point of view of international law, which cannot be suspended unilaterally,\" Grossi said. \"I hope that will not be the case, because otherwise we would be on the verge of a new major crisis.\"",
      "Anxiety in Iran fueling the ayatollah's claims?",
      "Khamenei's remarks on Thursday were heavy on rhetorical flourish and virtually devoid of any facts, and they may have been aimed more at Iran's people than the wider world.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers, who swept to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled a pro-Western government led by the royal family of the shah, have long maintained tight control over all media in the country, and many Iranians have little access to outside information.",
      "Still, especially among younger, more tech-savvy generations, there is an understanding of the degree to which Iran's people do not enjoy the freedoms that many other countries guarantee \u2014 and it has led to several popular protest uprisings over the last decade. All of them have been brutally quashed by the authorities, but Netanyahu called very quickly after Israel started bombing Iran for new anti-government protests in the country, urging Iranians to take advantage of the attacks, which he said had put the ayatollah in his weakest position ever.",
      "Khamenei has yet to be seen live or in public since the ceasefire, and his precise whereabouts remained unclear Thursday after the pre-recorded video message was released.",
      "While the ceasefire enabled Israelis to revel on Wednesday in a return to normalcy, with the lifting of 12 days of war-time security measures, in Tehran, anxiety still appeared rife.",
      "CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab and his team were granted Iranian visas to enter the country earlier in the week, and they were the first American broadcast network to enter Tehran since the war began. But it took them an arduous journey through arid landscapes and across the border from Turkey to reach Iran's capital, as the country's airspace had been closed.",
      "Tyab said the Iranian capital felt very different this week compared to his previous visit about five years earlier, when, despite the government's authoritarian control over daily life, it was a vibrant metropolis. On Thursday, despite the truce, most businesses remained shut, and the sense of nervousness was palpable.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "As day broke Wednesday, CBS News traveled through a vast countryside that was arid, rocky and seemingly endless.",
      "CBS News was forced to drive in because even though there is a ceasefire that took effect earlier this week, Iran's airspace was closed, but has since partially reopened.",

    "summary": "Trump says U.S. strikes \"totally obliterated\" 3 Iranian nuclear facilities, but the extent of the damage to Iran's nuclear program remains unclear.",
    "story": [
      "Tel Aviv\u00a0\u2014 Israel said it carried out more strikes on Iran on Monday, targeting missile, satellite and radar sites two days after President Trump ordered American warplanes to join Israel in attacking the Islamic Republic's nuclear facilities, fueling concern around the world of an escalating conflict in the heart of the Middle East with the potential to draw in major world powers.",
      "Those concerns may continue to mount, as both Mr. Trump and Israeli officials hint at hopes that the military operations could result in the fall of Iran's theocratic rulers, and as Iran's top diplomat visits Russia looking for support from a key ally. Israel is also expanding its list of targets in Iran to hit sites linked directly to the ruling theocracy's grip on power domestically.",
      "The office of Israel's defense minister said Monday that the military was \"attacking with unprecedented force regime targets and government repression entities in the heart of Iran.\" It was the first time Israel has acknowledged striking targets linked to the Iranian regime's domestic authority, rather than its military or nuclear assets.",
      "The defense minister's office said the new targets included the notorious Evin Prison, where political prisoners are held, a clock in Tehran's Palestine Square that symbolically displays a countdown to the destruction of the state of Israel, and the headquarters of Iran's Basij paramilitary forces, which among other things acts as a morality police force for the Islamic rulers.",
      "\"For every shot fired at the Israeli home front, the Iranian dictator will be punished and the attacks will continue with full force,\" the defense minister's office said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said earlier Monday that Israeli warplanes had also struck six airports in Iran, \"as part of the effort to expand air superiority over Iranian skies,\" targeting runways, various aircraft and underground hangers.",
      "Iran also launched a new wave of missiles at Israel on Monday, sending people to bomb shelters across the country. Dozens of missiles were reportedly launched at Israel, with impacts in at least two sites in the northern port city of Haifa and on a road in the southern city of Ashdod.",
      "Israel Electric Corporation said that, following a strike near one of its strategic facilities in southern Israel, there was disruption in the supply of electricity to a number of communities in the area.",
      "The attacks came after U.S. B2 bombers attacked three of Iran's nuclear sites over the weekend \u2013 the first direct U.S. military action against Iran after a week of Israeli attacks.",
      "Iranian nuclear sites \"totally obliterated\" by U.S. strikes?",
      "President Trump said in a televised address on Sunday that Iran's highly fortified Fordo nuclear enrichment site, along with the Isfahan and Natanz nuclear facilities, had been \"completely and totally obliterated\" by the U.S. strikes.",
      "\"Initial battle damage assessments indicate that all three sites sustained extremely severe damage and destruction,\" the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine, said during a news conference, noting that a full assessment of the damage would take time.",
      "But while Mr. Trump said in a social media post that the \"spectacular military success\" in Iran had taken \"the 'bomb' right out of their hands,\" The New York Times reported that the head of the global nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, believed Iran could have moved at least some of its stockpile of highly enriched uranium to another location before the U.S. attack, as Iranian officials have claimed.",
      "In remarks to the United Nations Security Council on Sunday, IAEA chief Rafael Grossi did not mention that prospect specifically, but he said \"no one \u2014 including the IAEA \u2014 is in a position to assess the underground damage\" at\u00a0Iran's most sensitive site at Fordo, where the regime is believed to have carried out advanced enrichment work in secret.",
      "\"We must return to the negotiating table and allow the IAEA inspectors, the guardians of the NPT [nuclear non-proliferation treaty], to go back to Iran's nuclear sites and account for the stockpiles of uranium, including, most importantly, the 400kg enriched to 60%,\" Grossi said, referring to the bulk of Iran's highly-enriched uranium, previously known to have been stored at the Isfahan facility. Uranium enriched to that level is only a short technical step away from the 90% purity required to make a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"We have a window of opportunity to return to dialogue and diplomacy. If that window closes, violence and destruction could reach unthinkable levels and the global non-proliferation regime as we know it could crumble and fall,\" Grossi warned the delegations at the U.N.",
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" it would take days to confirm whether Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved, but he thought it was unlikely.",
      "\"No one will know for sure for days, but I doubt they moved it, because you really can't move anything right now. They can't move anything right now inside Iran. The minute a truck starts driving anywhere the Israelis have seen it, and targeted it and taken it out. So our assessment is, we have to assume that \u2014 that's a lot of 60% enriched uranium buried deep under the ground there at Isfahan. And that really is key. What they should do with that is they should bring it out of the ground and turn it over. Multiple countries in the world will take it and down-blend it. That's what they should do with that,\" Rubio said, adding another call for Iran to agree to abandon its enrichment work to end the crisis.",
      "Rubio said if Iran were to \"call right now, and say 'we wanna meet, let's talk about this,' we're prepared to do that. The president's made that clear from the very beginning. His preference is to deal with this issue diplomatically.\"",
      "Trump hints at prospect of regime change in Iran",
      "Rubio also reiterated on Sunday President Trump's previous statements that the U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear sites were carried out with the sole purpose of removing the threat of the regime obtaining a nuclear weapon.",
      "\"It was not attack on Iran. It was not an attack on the Iranian people. This wasn't a regime change move,\" Rubio said.",
      "Mr. Trump had, right after the U.S. strikes, said they would be the extent of America's involvement in the conflict unless Iran launched retaliatory attacks against U.S. assets in the region. But late on Sunday, in a social media post, Mr. Trump stoked concern about a possible further escalation of the conflict.",
      "\"If the current Iranian Regime is unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN, why wouldn't there be a Regime change???\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Asked about the president's remarks on Monday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Mr. Trump \"was just simply raising a question that I think many people around the world are asking: If the Iranian regime refuses to give up their nuclear program or engage in talks \u2014 we just took out their nuclear program on Saturday night, as you all know \u2014 but if they refuse to engage in diplomacy moving forward, why shouldn't the Iranian people rise up against this brutal terrorist regime? That's a question the president raised last night. But as far as far as our military posture, it has not been changed.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his top aids have also suggested in recent days that the military action taken by Israel could make room for an uprising in the Islamic Republic to topple Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's regime, and Netanyahu has called directly on Iranians to take to the streets.",

So I just wanted to put on the record that we think it would be objectionable and crossing a line for any summation to bring up politics or current events or the propriety of this prosecution and the use of government resources. I would hope that Mr. Agnifilo would not cross over those lines, but I just wanted to say that if he did, I would object in the middle of his summation and ask the Court to instruct the jury to disregard any comments like that.

      "Fox News' Alexis McAdams reports the latest on the trial from New York City.",
      "Closing arguments in Sean \"Diddy\" Combs' federal trial began Thursday, more than seven weeks after jurors were seated for the case. While the Bad Boy Records founder was the focus of the government's charges, his former chief of staff, Kristina (KK) Khorram, was brought up throughout witnesses' testimony, though she never testified nor was charged.",
      "KK was previously compared to Jeffrey Epstein's righthand woman, Ghislaine Maxwell, in a lawsuit brought against her and Diddy in March 2024. Music producer Rodney \"Lil Rod\" Jones claimed he witnessed KK ordering sex workers for Diddy. KK also had all the assistants keep drugs ready for Diddy at a moment's notice, according to Jones' allegations.",
      "\"From what we\u2019ve seen so far, the comparison between Kristina Khorram and Ghislaine Maxwell isn\u2019t really a fair one, given that Epstein\u2019s victims were underage girls,\" John J. Perlstein explained to Fox News Digital. \"Still, Khorram is an alleged co-conspirator in the Diddy case, so it makes sense that she wouldn\u2019t want to testify, as she would\u2019ve likely had to plead the Fifth.\"",

      "\"While Ghislaine Maxwell was not originally charged in the Jeffrey Epstein case, charges were eventually filed against her,\" the Los Angeles-based litigator added. \"That\u2019s likely what we see happening here with Khorram and the Diddy case. However, the criminal enterprise case against Diddy is extremely weak, and it\u2019s possible that the case against Khorram would be even weaker.\"",
      "During Diddy's sex trafficking and racketeering trial, prosecutors claimed the music mogul was the leader of the alleged criminal enterprise. His inner circle included his chief of staff, assistants and security.\u00a0Diddy's ex-girlfriend, Jane, testified KK was the rapper's \"righthand woman.\" The government claimed KK lived in Diddy's home in Miami and knew what he was doing all the time. She even allegedly responded to people from his phones.",
      "According to the prosecution, Diddy and his staff were involved in purchasing and distributing drugs. Jane testified that KK helped her transport drugs across state lines. KK was seemingly aware Diddy's assistants were purchasing drugs for the rapper. In texts shown during Brendan Paul's testimony, he asked KK for reimbursement.",

      "\"You never call a witness or ask a question that you don't know,\" Becker, who worked on R.

      "\"It's very common in enterprise cases that you're going to want, as the government, to bring in as many witnesses as you can to show that this was, in fact, an organized organization. Now, the question becomes, 'Well, if KK is the one who was responsible for some of the very criminal activities that they're now putting on P. Diddy, why isn't she charged with the same types of crimes?'",
      "\"From a legal strategy standpoint, the big fish is who you go after,\" Becker added. \"Who's the big fish that the public knows? Who is the hip-hop mogul that we all know of?

      "\"And she didn\u2019t push me \u2013 Jule never pushed anybody to do anything they were uncomfortable with,\" the supermodel shared. \"She brought out some other bathing suits that were a little more demure that I felt more comfortable with.\"",

      "But according to experts, this isn\u2019t inevitable. Dental professionals shared the following tips to prevent tooth loss and boost overall health.",
      "1. Protect gum health",
      "About two in three adults over age 65 are dealing with some form of gum disease, according to a recently published AARP report.",
      "6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",

      "Left untreated, gum disease can also destroy the bones that hold teeth in place and may interfere with nutrition and chewing.",
      "Gum disease is also a source of chronic inflammation in the body, which can contribute to dementia risk, studies have shown. A meta-analysis of about 34,000 people found that older adults who had lost all of their teeth had a 1.4 times greater risk of developing dementia, as cited by AARP.",
      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth.",

      "\"It\u2019s especially valuable for patients with arthritis, limited mobility or trouble using traditional floss,\" Frey told Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Take steps to prevent dry mouth",
      "Saliva plays an essential role in neutralizing acids and protecting tooth enamel, but dry mouth affects nearly six in 10 older adults, according to AARP.",

      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",
      "The recommended frequency of dental visits is not one-size-fits-all, according to AARP. Some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits. (iStock)",
      "Oral health issues in older adults often go unnoticed, especially those related to bite alignment, according to Frey.",
      "\"Bite-related issues are often an overlooked source of headaches and neck pain,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The public simply hasn\u2019t been informed that tension, misalignment and jaw dysfunction can manifest in ways that seem unrelated at first glance.\"",

      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare may not cover all necessary procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",

      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",
      "And while sugary cough drops or hard candies may seem harmless, they can be damaging to tooth enamel over time, experts warn.",
      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",
      "\"A delicate, thin porcelain veneer can restore the vitality, color and shape your teeth once had, enhancing your smile and overall appearance,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

The process starts when the device pulls in ambient air. Inside, advanced materials capture the water vapor in the air. That moisture is then heated to kill any microbes, and it passes through a dual-stage UV sterilization system and a carbon filter to remove impurities, bacteria and particles.",
      "Once the water is purified, the Kara Pod adds essential minerals like calcium, magnesium and sodium. This turns into healthy, mineral-rich water that is ready to drink or brew with. The device can make up to 3.2 liters, which is about a gallon, of premium alkaline water every day.

      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account. But unfortunately, by then, the funds were already gone.",

      "Gift cards are one of the most common tools used in scams because they are fast, anonymous, and nearly impossible to recover once the code is shared. Scammers often claim that the cards are needed to cover fees, unlock a prize or verify your identity. Once a scammer has the code, they can do a few things:",

      "Sell the card on online marketplaces at a discount",
      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

      "Scams that impersonate celebrities or public figures have become increasingly common. Criminals use well-known names to create a false sense of trust and urgency. Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

In one case, a reader lost $800 after being promised a Tesla and $250,000 in cash, but only if they sent Apple Gift Cards first. These scams rely on trust, speed and celebrity recognition.

      "Security researchers emphasize that this isn't the result of a new, single breach. Instead, it's a massive collection of previously stolen credentials from various past leaks, phishing scams and third-party data exposures, some of which were forgotten, underreported or reshared.",

This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",

This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials.

      "With credential leaks becoming a growing threat, protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are five effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Use a password manager: Infostealer malware often targets passwords saved directly in web browsers, making them easy targets. Instead of relying on your browser to store credentials, use a dedicated password manager that offers zero-knowledge architecture and military-grade encryption to keep your data safe. The best options work across all your devices and browsers, offer secure sharing, monitor for data breaches, and even generate health reports on your passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your credentials are stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Passwords, once the foundation of online identity, are now one of its weakest links. Companies like Google and Meta are already building systems that move beyond them. The tools are available.

      "How BeBot works: Tech specs and core features",
      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

    "summary": "A new ClickFix campaign targets macOS users with fake Spectrum support sites, tricking victims with CAPTCHA failures to paste commands that install information-stealing malware.",
    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "Fake Captcha on a Mac. (CloudSEK)",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of ClickFix malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider implementing these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Even experienced users can be tricked when malicious behavior is disguised as routine. The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves. Mac users, like everyone else, need to treat every familiar-looking interface with a little more skepticism. Especially when it asks for your password.",

      "3) Be wary of free health quizzes and symptom checkers:\u00a0If a site asks for personal details in exchange for \"insights,\" assume it\u2019s monetizing your answers. Consult your doctor, not a clickbait quiz.",
      "4) Limit data sharing beyond healthcare providers:\u00a0Only provide necessary information when signing up for health-related services or apps. Be wary of sharing health details on social media or in public forums, as these can be scraped by data brokers.",
      "5) Request data minimization from providers:\u00a0Ask your healthcare providers to collect and store only the minimum amount of personal information necessary for your care, reducing the risk if their systems are compromised.",
      "6) Use strong antivirus software: Strong antivirus software acts as a shield, protecting your devices from malware, ransomware, and other cyber threats that could compromise your personal health data. Choose a reputable solution that offers real-time threat detection, regular updates, and robust protection for all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.

      "7) Regularly update your software:\u00a0Cyber threats targeting health data are constantly evolving, and outdated software can leave your devices vulnerable to attacks that expose your sensitive information. Keeping your operating system, apps, antivirus, and security tools\u00a0up to date ensures you have the latest protections against malware, ransomware, and other exploits that data brokers or hackers might use to access your health information. Regular updates patch security holes before they can be exploited, helping to prevent breaches like those that have exposed millions of Americans' health details in recent years.",
      "8) Use strong and unique passwords:\u00a0Your health data is often protected by passwords on apps, portals, and devices. Using strong, unique passwords for each account reduces the risk that a single breach could give someone access to multiple sources of your personal information. Avoid common or reused passwords, and consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely. This step is crucial because once your login credentials are compromised, data brokers or cybercriminals can gather and sell your health-related data, leading to privacy violations, discrimination, or targeted scams. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Your health should be personal, but in today's digital world, that privacy is constantly under threat. Even if you're cautious, your health-related information can be collected, analyzed, and sold without your clear consent. The good news is that you can take real steps to reduce your exposure and protect what matters. This isn't about fear; it's about staying informed and taking control of your digital footprint.",

      "The introduction of advanced humanoid robots like Kepler's K2 naturally raises questions about the future of human employment in manufacturing and other industries. It's true that automation and robotics have the potential to change the way work is organized on the factory floor. Some worry that robots could replace jobs traditionally held by people, especially in roles that involve repetitive or physically demanding tasks.",
      "However, experts and industry leaders point out that the story is more nuanced. While certain jobs may be automated, new opportunities often emerge alongside technological advancements. For example, the rise of robotics is expected to create roles in robot maintenance, programming, AI training, and oversight, jobs that require different skills but are essential to supporting and managing these new systems. Many analysts believe that robots like the K2 are likely to complement human workers by taking over monotonous or hazardous duties, which allows people to focus on more complex, creative, or supervisory tasks.",
      "Collaborative robots, or \"cobots,\" are specifically designed to work alongside humans, enhancing productivity and safety rather than simply replacing labor. This collaborative approach can lead to new forms of teamwork and innovation on the factory floor, making work environments safer and more efficient. Ultimately, the integration of humanoid robots is expected to shift the workforce rather than eliminate it, opening up new possibilities for both businesses and employees as they adapt to a more automated future.",

If your web browser automatically populates your username and password for you, make sure this information is free of typos.",

Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites. This reduces your risk of identity theft, credential stuffing, phishing and spam.",

      "3. Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA): Enabling\u00a02FA is one of the most effective ways to stop unauthorized access, even if someone has your password. When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",

      "6. Keep your software up to date: Keep your device software and apps\u00a0up to date to patch security vulnerabilities that attackers often exploit.",
      "7. Use a VPN to protect your online activity: Avoid public Wi-Fi or use a VPN to protect your information when browsing on unsecured networks. Consider using a VPN to protect against hackers snooping on your device as well. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

      "A Florida-based diver thought he was doing the right thing when he freed a group of sharks\u2014but instead, it led to a felony charge and, years later, a presidential pardon from Donald Trump.",
      "On May 28, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr. were two of the sixteen recipients of Trump\u2019s full pardons after the pair were convicted in 2020 of theft of property within special maritime jurisdiction.",

      "Tanner Mansell, 31, of Jupiter, Fla., was granted a Presidential Pardon from Donald Trump in May 2025. (Used with Permission via Tannerunderwater)",
      "In April 2020, Mansell and Moore took a group, which included the Kansas City police chief and a SWAT officer, and encountered a buoy connected to a longline over a dive site. A longline is a type of deep-sea fishing gear with baited hooks to catch fish.",
      "\"It was just another ordinary day on the water,\" Mansell said. \"I had been running trips there for years and never had anything like this happen. I spotted something red in the distance thinking that, you know, maybe it was trash or a diver,\" he said. \"We saw that it was a buoy connected to a line, which is when we started calling law enforcement.\"",
      "Unaware that the longline belonged to a legally sanctioned National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shark research operation, Mansell and his team acted swiftly and cut the line. They released 19 sharks back into the ocean.",
      "\"I had no idea that this could be possible, you know, that you could have a permit to kill all these sharks,\" he said, noting that they had called the Florida Wildlife Commission (FWC) and NOAA's hotline before making the decision.",

      "Despite their outreach to law enforcement, both divers were charged and convicted. While they avoided prison time, they were ordered to pay $3,343.72 in restitution, and the felony convictions prevented them from voting, owning firearms and traveling freely.",
      "\"The judge made a comment, and he commended us for our dedication to [the] environment,\" he said. \"He gave out what my lawyer said was probably the lowest sentence ever.\"",
      "Looking back, Mansell said he would have acted differently if he had known the law surrounding legal shark killings.",
      "\"Knowing what I know now, I absolutely would do things completely differently,\" he said. \"But if I didn\u2019t know that there were permits for this, I don\u2019t think that I would change anything\u2026 when you think you\u2019re doing the right thing, you think you\u2019re doing the right thing.\"",

      "A turning point came when the case went to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit and Judge Barbara Lagoa confirmed what Mansell believed throughout the legal process.",

      "Publicity from that opinion reached the libertarian Cato Institute, which published an article that eventually caught the attention of the White House.",
      "\"The White House actually called our lawyers and said that they were looking into this and asked for more information,\" he said. \"That was really cool because our lawyer called us that the White House had it in front of them and were looking into it.\"",
      "Mansell learned of his pardon while boarding a plane, sharing he was left \"speechless\" from the news.",
      "\"I was getting a call from my lawyer and I answered, and he says, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve got good news for you. You just got a full presidential pardon.\u2019 I was speechless. I couldn\u2019t even say thank you. I just soaked it in.\"",
      "Mansell profusely thanked the White House and Trump for the pardon.",
      "\"All I can say is thank you. And I hope that, you know, maybe in the name of sharks, we can all take a look at what\u2019s happening and say that [legal killings of sharks] shouldn\u2019t be happening in Florida.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m just so grateful. I have said thank you every step of the way. Words can\u2019t explain it,\" he said. \"I know that the White House took a look at this and they decided it was worth it. And I got President Trump's signature.\"",

      "\"I've learned so much through this process,\" he said. \"I've always considered myself a law-abiding citizen, somebody that doesn't break the law and I respect law enforcement and commercial fisherman.\"",

In a recent high-profile Idaho capital case, Lori Vallow Daybell, the court ruled that prosecutors could no longer seek the death penalty because they failed to comply with their discovery obligations,\" Rahmani said.",
      "On May 15, Judge Steven Hippler said a violation of the gag order was \"likely\" committed by someone involved in the case.

      "\"What\u2019s historic is that the U.S. carried out a limited operation on nuclear targets with zero losses\u2014no pilot, no equipment\u2014and helped Israel in a way only America could. Nuclear proliferation is nonpartisan, and this was an apolitical win.\" Even after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar, he added, \"the President showed immense restraint and kept focus on the broader goal: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continuing its terror campaign.\"",
      "Despite the violence that followed the announcement \u2014 including an Iranian strike that killed four civilians in Israel \u2014 Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold. \"Both countries have now said we\u2019re absolutely going to do it,\" he said. \"And yes, President Trump is very atypical in the way he communicates with the ceasefire\u2026 with the \u2018don\u2019t drop a single bomb.\u2019\"",

      "Spencer noted that in 1973, Israel used the final hours before a U.N.-brokered ceasefire to reposition forces. \"Israel made a bunch of moves in those last hours\u2026 to include encircling the Third Army, moving on Suez City,\" he said, referencing his case study on the Battle of Suez City.",

      "Even more recently, during the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, ceasefires were often brief and symbolic. \"Putin said, \u2018I want three days so I can do my parade,\u2019\" Spencer remarked, highlighting how temporary pauses can serve both strategic and political needs.",
      "While past ceasefires were designed to slow escalation, Spencer sees this one as part of a broader strategic doctrine. \"To help Israel in a way only United States could, that should be nonpartisan,\" he said. \"For the United States to do a very limited operation, without a single loss of American life\u2026 that\u2019s unique.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

      "The Supreme Court on Friday granted the HIV-prevention field a historic win \u2014 yet with a major caveat \u2014 as it upheld a federally appointed health task force\u2019s authority to mandate no-cost insurance coverage of certain preventive interventions, but clarifying that the health and human services secretary holds dominion over the panel.",
      "The 6-3 decision in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. essentially leaves in place a popular pillar of the Affordable Care Act, which mandates that most insurers cover various task force-recommended preventive screenings, therapies and interventions, with no out-of-pocket costs imposed on patients. The case reached the high court after a group of Christian businesses in Texas objected to being compelled to cover certain drugs used for HIV prevention, known as PrEP,  given their claims that it \u201cpromotes homosexuality.\u201d",
      "\u201cSince our efforts to address HIV in the U.S. are under attack on so many levels, preserving insurers\u2019 requirement to cover preventive services, including PrEP, will help ensure access to people who need it,\u201d said Carl Schmid, executive director of the HIV + Hepatitis Policy Institute, a patient advocacy group in Washington, D.C.",
      "But the court clarified the scope of the task force\u2019s independence, thus potentially compromising its impact. Addressing concerns that the 16-member volunteer task force\u2019s power over insurers was unconstitutional, the justices asserted that the health secretary holds the authority to appoint and dismiss the panelists and to block their new recommendations from mandating insurance coverage. The secretary could also possibly direct the panel, including one stocked with his or her own hand-picked members, to revisit previous recommendations that have already gone into effect.",
      "Given the unpredictable nature and unconventional approach to health policy of the current health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., HIV advocates are concerned that he might undermine the task force\u2019s current or future endorsements of HIV-prevention medications, known as PrEP.",
      "The ruling \u201cis a victory in the sense that it leaves intact the requirement to cover task-force recommendations,\u201d said attorney Richard Hughes, a partner with Epstein Becker Green in Washington, D.C., who represented a group of HIV advocacy organizations in submitting a friend-of-the-court brief in the casel. \u201cIt was always going to be a double-edged sword, as the political accountability that salvaged its authority comes with the ability to alter its recommendations.\u201d",
      "The U.S. has secured only a modest decline recently in HIV cases, and HIV advocates  stand at a crossroads amid the Trump administration\u2019s dramatic withdrawal of support for their cause.",
      "Promisingly, the Food and Drug Administration last week approved a long-acting injectable form of PrEP, Yeztugo, made by Gilead Sciences. Injected every six months, Yeztugo overwhelmingly bested Truvada, a daily-pill form of PrEP also made by Gilead, at lowering HIV transmissions in clinical trials.",
      "But Yeztugo has debuted as the Trump administration is gutting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s HIV-prevention division and after it canceled scores of HIV-related research grants.",
      "HIV experts have warned that this upheaval could lead HIV to rise again.",
      "Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc.",
      "The plaintiffs\u2019 initial religious-liberty complaint was ultimately dropped from the case. The court more narrowly considered the constitutionality of an ACA provision that lent effective authority to a longstanding volunteer medical task force to mandate no-cost insurance coverage to preventive interventions that the expert group rated highly, including PrEP.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that because the task force was not appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, granting it such power over insurance markets violated the Constitution\u2019s appointments clause. The justices grappled with the task force\u2019s balance of independence versus accountability. In particular, they sought to determine whether the task force members were appointed by the Senate-confirmed Health and Human Services secretary.",
      "In addition to PrEP, the task force has issued high scores, for example, to screening for lung cancer, diabetes, and HIV; treatment to help quit smoking; and behavioral counseling to prevent heart disease.",
      "Had the Supreme Court fully sided with the plaintiffs, insurers would have been free to drop such popular benefits or, at the very least, to impose related co-pays and other cost sharing.",
      "Writing for the majority, Justice Brett Kavanaugh found that the health secretary has the power \u201cto appoint Task Force members, and no statute restricts their removal.\u201d He was joined by an ideological mix of colleagues, including Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett on the right, and Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson on the left.",
      "Concerns and uncertainty about Kennedy",
      "HIV advocates expressed concern that Kennedy might undo the task force\u2019s recommendation for PrEP, or at the least deprioritize ensuring that Yeztugo receives a clear coverage mandate.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy dismissed the entire CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, and replaced them with his own hand-picked selections, including one notable anti-vaccine activist. At the first meeting of the newly formed committee this week, ACIP dropped recommendations for some flu vaccines over claims, widely debunked by researchers, that one ingredient in them is tied to autism.",
      "Mitchell Warren, executive director of the HIV advocacy nonprofit AVAC, expressed concern about \u201cwhat happened with the CDC ACIP this week, as it could be a harbinger of what a secretary of HHS can do to twist committees and task forces that should be composed of experts guided by science to ones that are guided by ideology and politics.\u201d",
      "In an email to NBC News, Carmel Shachar, faculty director of the Health Law and Policy Clinic at Harvard Law School, characterized Kennedy\u2019s potential approach to overseeing the health task force as unpredictable.",
      "\u201cRFK has been skeptical of the medical approach to HIV/AIDS in the past, and that may color his attitude to revising PrEP guidance,\u201d Shachar said.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS said in an emailed statement that Kennedy \"supports science-based public health policy and remains fully committed to HIV prevention.\"",
      "\"Under his leadership, critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue as part of the newly established Administration for a Healthy America (AHA),\" the spokesperson added.",
      "In 2019, the health task force granted Truvada as PrEP a top rating. The drug was already widely covered by insurers. But under ACA rules, the task force\u2019s recommendation meant that by January 2021, insurance plans needed to cease imposing cost-sharing for the drug.",
      "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, then clarified that insurers were also forbidden to impose cost sharing for the quarterly clinic visits and lab tests required for a PrEP prescription.",
      "A CDC study published in October found that about 200,000 people were using PrEP at any point in 2023.",
      "In 2019, the FDA approved another Gilead daily pill, Descovy, for use as PrEP. In late 2021, ViiV Healthcare\u2019s Apretude \u2014 an injection given every two months \u2014 was also green lit.",
      "The health task force gave top ratings to both of the newer forms of PrEP in 2023, which triggered a mandate for no-cost coverage to begin in January.",
      "A generic version of Truvada emerged in 2020 and now costs as little as $30 per month. The list prices of the three brand-name PrEP drugs range from about $2,200 to $2,350 a month.",
      "How the court\u2019s ruling could play out for HIV prevention",
      "Were Kennedy to appoint task force members who ultimately voided the PrEP coverage mandate, generic Truvada, at the very least, would still likely remain widely covered by insurance. But insurers would be free to demand cost-sharing for all forms of PrEP, including for required clinic visits and lab tests. And they could restrict access to the more expensive versions, including by imposing prior authorization requirements and higher cost sharing.",
      "Research suggests that even a small increase in monthly out-of-pocket costs for PrEP can depress its use and that those who accordingly forgo a prescription are especially likely to contract HIV.",
      "Johanna Mercier, Gilead\u2019s chief commercial officer, said even before the health task force\u2019s 2023 insurance mandate for Descovy went into effect in January, the drug\u2019s coverage was still pretty solid. Private insurers provided unrestricted coverage of Descovy for PrEP to 74% of commercially insured people, and 40% of prescriptions for the drug had no co-pay. After the mandate went into effect \u2014 including after CMS released a clarification on the PrEP-coverage mandate in October \u2014 those rates increased to 93% and 85%, respectively.",
      "This experience, Mercier said, has left the company optimistic that an increasing proportion of health plans will cover Yeztugo during the coming months.",
      "Health-policy experts are not certain whether the existing PrEP rating from the task force automatically applies to Yeztugo, or whether the drug will require its own rating to ensure coverage comes with no cost sharing.",
      "If Apretude\u2019s history is any guide, a requirement for Yeztugo to receive a specific rating could delay a no-cost insurance-coverage mandate for the drug from going into effect until January 2027 or 2028.",
      "It\u2019s also possible that CMS could release guidance clarifying that the existing mandate for PrEP coverage applies to Yeztugo, which would likely have a more immediate impact on coverage.",
      "However, Elizabeth Kaplan, director of health care access at Harvard\u2019s Health Law and Policy Clinic, said in an email that \u201cgiven this administration\u2019s and RFK\u2019s stated priorities,\u201d the publication of a guidance on Yeztugo coverage by an HHS division \u201cappears unlikely.\u201d"

      "The challengers argued the law violates the Constitution\u2019s First Amendment because it places a \u201ccontent-based burden\u201d on adults\u2019 access to speech.",
      "They cited a 2004 Supreme Court ruling that found a federal law also aimed at restricting access to pornography, called the Child Online Protection Act, was most likely unconstitutional.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the provision at issue was problematic because it did not merely restrict access to minors.",
      "The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals then ruled for Texas and refused to put its ruling on hold pending further review.",
      "As a result of that ruling, some online pornography platforms, including Pornhub, prevented people in Texas from accessing their sites out of concern about the provision\u2019s going into effect.",
      "The Supreme Court in April 2024 declined to block the law while the case continued."

      "More than 10 million people are enrolled in community colleges across the United States. Students who attend four-year colleges can also apply for Pell Grants, but community colleges are often a gateway into the higher education pipeline for low- to middle-income students.",

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Young people in China may not be buying cars or  houses, but there\u2019s always money for milk tea and toys.",
      "It\u2019s a challenging time to be a young person in China: The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is growing far slower than it was when their parents were their age, with the U.S.-China trade war threatening to further weigh on growth. Competition for jobs is cutthroat and monthly youth unemployment stands at about 15% on average, with Chinese universities churning out a record 12.22 million new graduates this year.",
      "Feeling \u201cbesieged\u201d in life in the face of these economic obstacles, young Chinese consumers at home and abroad are finding comfort in smaller purchases.",
      "\u201cI spend to make myself happy,\u201d said Kitty Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese student in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cIt sounds a bit reckless, but I do have a number in my mind.\u201d",
      "Lu said most of her spending goes toward supporting celebrities she likes. Occasionally, she allows herself a \u201csmall indulgence\u201d in the form of \u201cblind box\u201d toys such as Disney dolls or the Labubu monster figurines that have become a global frenzy.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not that into these dolls,\u201d she said, adding that the purchase is more about having fun with friends as they open the blind box together to see which doll is inside.",
      "Lu\u2019s spending habits reflect a growing trend in recent years among young Chinese who show \u201clow interest\u201d in big purchases such as houses and cars but are embracing food and cultural products that offer \u201cinstant emotional gratification,\u201d according to the Fudan Development Institute, a Shanghai-based think tank.",
      "This phenomenon, also known as \u201cemotional consumption,\u201d has resulted in average annual growth of about 12% in industries including films and games since 2013, according to a report in March by the Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft. The overall market for emotional consumption is projected to exceed $270 billion this year, the report said.",
      "Sweet drinks, low prices, happier life",
      "One of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese consumer trends has been the country\u2019s beverage sector, which according to S&P Global is expected to grow up to 6% this year.",
      "Mixue, a bubble tea chain known for its cheap drinks, now has more stores worldwide \u2014 over 45,000, with nearly 10% of them outside mainland China \u2014 than any other food and beverage chain, including McDonald\u2019s, which has a global store count of 43,000, and Starbucks, with 38,000. In March, Mixue\u2019s shares jumped more than 40% on its market debut in Hong Kong.",
      "The brand\u2019s success stems largely from its low prices and rapid expansion, especially in less developed cities, as Chinese people adjust their spending habits while grappling with job security and other economic concerns.",
      "Kelsey Yu, 23, a graduate student in Beijing, said she bought a bottle of lemonade from Mixue for the equivalent of less than $1 on a visit in April to the southern Chinese city of Jieyang.",
      "\u201cThe drink quenched my thirst. It had a large portion and was cheap,\u201d she said, adding that Mixue\u2019s items are \u201cbetter value for money\u201d than those of many local competitors.",
      "Yu said that as a foodie, she drinks tea-based beverages at least once or twice a week and may \u201cindulge a bit more\u201d while traveling.",
      "\u201cI usually order milk tea when I\u2019m feeling tired or if I just want to have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have self-control. So I won\u2019t have it every day.\u201d",
      "A complicated picture of Chinese consumption",
      "While U.S. officials often say Chinese consumers are not spending enough, the situation is not as clear-cut as it is portrayed, analysts said.",
      "In the past quarter-century, China\u2019s consumer spending has grown an average of 8% or more each year, one of the highest rates among major economies. But it has been outstripped by investment, making consumption a smaller part of China\u2019s overall GDP.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cSummer Davos\u201d event in Tianjin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said China sought to become a \u201cmega-sized consumption powerhouse.\u201d",
      "Boosted by government subsidies, China\u2019s retail sales grew 6.4% in May, the fastest rate since late 2023.",
      "Sales during this year\u2019s monthlong 618 online shopping festival, which ended June 18, were a record 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun, 15.2% higher than last year.",
      "Young Chinese in particular are \u201cliving frugally to spend big,\u201d according to state-backed research. Though they are budget-conscious when it comes to daily necessities, they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to splurge\u201d for their hobbies and happiness, it said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather spend 300 yuan ($42) on a great meal, and if the food is really good, I would think it\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Yu said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a 300-yuan piece of clothing, I might hesitate.\u201d",
      "Amid China\u2019s economic challenges, middle-class consumers are less brand-conscious and prefer cheaper alternatives, said Yaling Jiang, founder of ApertureChina, a consulting firm that specializes in consumer research.",
      "\u201cNow saving is seen as cool, and seeking value is seen as cool,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cI think the downturn definitely changed the culture of spending.\u201d",
      "Chinese mallgoers these days spend money almost exclusively on the first and second floors, where food and beverage shops are concentrated, Jiang said.",
      "\u201cPeople are walking around the mall with a cup of milk tea or coffee,\u201d she added, looking at what\u2019s available in stores before going home to buy cheaper alternatives online.",
      "China\u2019s luxury market, which had accounted for almost a third of global sales, declined 18% to 20% last year, according to a January report by Bain and Company.",
      "\u201cI think there is less focus on the social status comparison, and more focus on what brings them personal happiness,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING, a post-pandemic change that has also been seen elsewhere.",
      "Consumers in China are both trading up and spending down, depending on the sector, said Shan Guo, a partner at Hutong Research, an investment advisory group based in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey are not buying luxury bags, but they are buying Pop Mart,\u201d  Guo said, referring to the Chinese retailer behind the Labubu toys. \u201cLabubu can be quite expensive.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about slower economic growth in China and elsewhere, Lu, the Melbourne student, said her friends are still \u201cquite willing to spend for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not big spenders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just happy to treat themselves when having a good time.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for  centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

      "For months while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, Badar Khan Suri, the Georgetown University postdoctoral scholar who was targeted for deportation by the Trump administration, said he spun a tale for his 5-year-old sons to help them cope with his absence.",
      "\u201cFor my younger twins, I created a story they could hold on to: I told them I was traveling and had gotten lost somewhere in the clouds, trying to find my way back home,\u201d Khan Suri said in an email to NBC News.",
      "It was one of the ways, Khan Suri said, that he attempted to continue to parent his three children \u201cwith love, creativity and resilience\u201d from detention. Now, just over a month since his release from an ICE facility in Texas, Khan Suri reflected on his experience with family separation, one that he said took a significant toll on his wife and children.",
      "Khan Suri credits his wife, Maphaz Ahmad Yousef, with being a critical support system for their children, calling her a \u201cblessing.\u201d However, he\u2019s still processing the pain of separation, he said.",
      "\u201cFor my family also, I feel the power dynamic changed. I am no more the provider or protector I once was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have survivor\u2019s clarity, as I saw the injustice. I am rebuilding my journey with meaning and truth.\u201d",
      "Parenting from detention, he said, \u201cwas one of the most heartbreaking parts of my experience \u2014 but also the one that kept me going.\u201d",
      "These days, Khan Suri \u2014 who was released last month after a judge ruled that his detention violated the First Amendment right to free speech and the Fifth Amendment right to due process \u2014 said his children have been enjoying life with both their parents at home. He said he has returned to some quintessential dad duties including bringing his kids to the bus stop, and he\u2019s earned the privilege of being identified as the favorite parent in the household.",
      "\u201cEven the twins say \u2018Baba\u2019 when I ask who they love more,\u201d he joked. \u201cBefore, it was always a clear \u2018Mama.\u2019\u201d",
      "But three months ago, Khan Suri was pulled away from his family when he was arrested outside his Arlington, Virginia, home and accused by the Department of Homeland Security of \u201cactively spreading Hamas propaganda and promoting antisemitism on social media.\u201d He was never formally charged with a crime.",
      "Khan Suri \u201chas close connections to a known or suspected terrorist, who is a senior advisor to Hamas,\u201d DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in March on X.",
      "His attorney Hassan Ahmad has repeatedly denied that he ever made pro-Hamas or antisemitic statements. Khan Suri\u2019s father-in-law, Ahmed Yousef, was an adviser to a now-deceased Hamas leader. Yousef said he left his position more than a decade ago and he has since become a critic of Hamas.",
      "Khan Suri described the first week in ICE custody as a \u201cnightmare.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat night, my wife was only able to bring back my belongings. My elder son only saw my bag returning home and not me,\u201d he said of the night of his arrest. \u201cI was sad for my children, who had lost their father, their security cover, their ease in life.\u201d",
      "He had been moved across multiple facilities and three states, finally landing in Prairieland Detention Center in Alvarado, Texas. However, as Khan Suri\u2019s detention stretched on, he said, he aimed to maintain some semblance of lightness for his family. During their occasional phone calls home, Khan Suri said he made sure his youngest children absorbed his tall tale about the clouds.",
      "\u201cWhen I first had the chance to speak with them, I repeated that same story,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would draw pictures for me, and even save cupcakes or slices of pizza for me as if I might come back at any moment \u2014 they refused to let anyone else touch my share.\u201d",
      "While his youngest sons believed he had been journeying through the skies, Khan Suri said his oldest child had picked up on bits and pieces of his situation. And while at the facility, the father said, he had attempted to paint a more positive picture of the conditions he was living in, particularly as his 9-year-old became more withdrawn.",
      "\u201cI tried to bring humor into our conversations when I could,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d tell him I had a PlayStation 4, a basketball court and a soccer field where I was, and he would laugh and ask questions about them.\u201d",
      "According to Khan Suri\u2019s habeas petition, he wasn\u2019t assigned a bed in a dorm when he first arrived at the facility. Instead, he was placed in the detention\u2019s \u201cTV room,\u201d where the television runs every day from 5 a.m. to 2 a.m., according to the petition. Khan Suri had also requested religious accommodations and only received halal food after five days, the documents said.",
      "\u201cOn April 2, officers came and told him that he had complained through his lawyer about his religious accommodations and asked him for more details,\u201d the petition said. \u201cAfter Dr. Khan Suri reaffirmed his needs, he was given a prayer mat, a Quran, and provided a space on a bed in the dorm, outside of the TV room.\u201d",
      "He was also issued a bright-red uniform, usually reserved for individuals classified as requiring high security due to their criminal history, the petition said. When he inquired about the uniform, Khan Suri was told that he fell under the category due to his association \u201cwith a known criminal group \u2014 presumably based on Respondents\u2019 unfounded claims of his connections to Hamas,\u201d the petition said.",
      "\u201cDue to his classification and security protocols at the facility, Dr. Khan Suri is only permitted two hours per week of recreation,\u201d the petition said.",
      "Khan Suri said he kept his children front of mind in order to cope with the circumstances, as well.",
      "\u201cI would write about them, I would think about them \u2014 like when their school bus would come, when would it return, what they do during the day, what they were drawing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I saw drawings by kids of other detainees, I felt the love for my children.\u201d",
      "After he was released following the judge\u2019s ruling that the government had failed to provide evidence that Khan Suri was a flight risk or a danger to the community, he said the reunion with his children was joyful.",
      "\u201cIn the morning, I woke up before them. When they saw me, all three were shouting with joy, hugging and kissing me,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the twins, I had finally come back from the \u2018clouds.\u2019\u201d"

      "Hundreds of thousands of community college students are at risk of losing financial assistance under the proposed \u201cBig Beautiful Bill,\u201d which would tighten eligibility requirements for Pell Grants.",
      "Students would be required to enroll full time to maintain eligibility for the federally subsidized grants that serve as a financial lifeline for many low- to middle-income students.",
      "The bill would increase the number of credit hours students must take each semester from 12 to 15 and could strain those who work, parent, suffer financial distress or otherwise find it difficult to increase their course loads, according to the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "More than 10 million people are enrolled in community colleges across the United States. Students who attend four-year colleges can also apply for Pell Grants, but community colleges are often a gateway into the higher education pipeline for low- to middle-income students.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have any other options,\u201d said Lakina Mabins, 41, a mother of five who worked two jobs before becoming valedictorian last month at Kennedy King College in Chicago. \u201cI couldn\u2019t take out a loan if I wanted to because you have to have good credit.\u201d",
      "Students can receive between $740 and $7,395 a year from the Pell Grant program, according to the the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "It costs $4,050 a year on average to attend a community college, while the average four-year, in-state tuition at a public university is $11,610 a year, the association said.",
      "Tighter restrictions for Pell Grant eligibility are part of a sweeping congressional budget bill advanced by Republicans and aimed at cutting taxes and government spending.",
      "House Republicans approved their version of the bill in May, and it\u2019s now being considered by the Senate.",
      "Student Maria Baez, who attends the Community College of Philadelphia, said she would likely have to drop out of school if the bill becomes law because she would not be able to afford it.",
      "She said she received about $3,600 through the Pell Grant program last semester.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even have a backup plan,\u201d said Baez, 41, who wants to own a small marketing business one day. \u201cBut I want so badly to further my education so that I can have a career.\u201d",
      "Hundreds of thousands of students could be at risk of losing their grants if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is approved, said Martha Parham, a spokeswoman for the American Association of Community Colleges.",
      "Many students are unable to attend college full time because they have other responsibilities, she said.",
      "\u201cCommunity colleges are the on-ramp to the middle class,\u201d Parham said, but costs can pose a strong barrier.",
      "The first grants were awarded in 1973; the program was later named for the late Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.",
      "The Big Beautiful Bill would also do away with subsidized federal loans, which would force college borrowers to accumulate more debt.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely hard for people to get out of debt with these changes,\u201d Astra Taylor, co-founder of the Debt Collective, an organization that helps people fight debt, told CNBC.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which is playing a key role in drafting the Senate\u2019s version of the bill, was unavailable for comment this week, his office said.",
      "Cassidy has said the entire Big Beautiful Bill would save an estimated $300 billion in government spending and lift the burden on taxpayers who subsidize college graduates\u2019 loan payments.",
      "But student Michael Weaver, 34, who attends Stanly Community College in Albemarle, North Carolina, on a Pell Grant, said part of the appeal of attending a two-year college is to take courses at your own pace.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a stretch for most students, and to be honest, the majority of students receiving the grant are working people who only have the option of attending school part time,\u201d Weaver said.",
      "Mabins, who plans to attend National Louis University in downtown Chicago this fall, considers herself a low-income student because she lives in public housing and is enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps.",
      "\u201cThe government wants me off assistance, but they are creating more debt and making it harder for me to better myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI have goals, and in the next five years, I see myself with a master\u2019s degree and working in my career field.\u201d"

    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 10:00:00 GMT",
    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Young people in China may not be buying cars or  houses, but there\u2019s always money for milk tea and toys.",
      "It\u2019s a challenging time to be a young person in China: The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is growing far slower than it was when their parents were their age, with the U.S.-China trade war threatening to further weigh on growth. Competition for jobs is cutthroat and monthly youth unemployment stands at about 15% on average, with Chinese universities churning out a record 12.22 million new graduates this year.",
      "Feeling \u201cbesieged\u201d in life in the face of these economic obstacles, young Chinese consumers at home and abroad are finding comfort in smaller purchases.",
      "\u201cI spend to make myself happy,\u201d said Kitty Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese student in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cIt sounds a bit reckless, but I do have a number in my mind.\u201d",
      "Lu said most of her spending goes toward supporting celebrities she likes. Occasionally, she allows herself a \u201csmall indulgence\u201d in the form of \u201cblind box\u201d toys such as Disney dolls or the Labubu monster figurines that have become a global frenzy.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not that into these dolls,\u201d she said, adding that the purchase is more about having fun with friends as they open the blind box together to see which doll is inside.",
      "Lu\u2019s spending habits reflect a growing trend in recent years among young Chinese who show \u201clow interest\u201d in big purchases such as houses and cars but are embracing food and cultural products that offer \u201cinstant emotional gratification,\u201d according to the Fudan Development Institute, a Shanghai-based think tank.",
      "This phenomenon, also known as \u201cemotional consumption,\u201d has resulted in average annual growth of about 12% in industries including films and games since 2013, according to a report in March by the Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft. The overall market for emotional consumption is projected to exceed $270 billion this year, the report said.",
      "Sweet drinks, low prices, happier life",
      "One of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese consumer trends has been the country\u2019s beverage sector, which according to S&P Global is expected to grow up to 6% this year.",
      "Mixue, a bubble tea chain known for its cheap drinks, now has more stores worldwide \u2014 over 45,000, with nearly 10% of them outside mainland China \u2014 than any other food and beverage chain, including McDonald\u2019s, which has a global store count of 43,000, and Starbucks, with 38,000. In March, Mixue\u2019s shares jumped more than 40% on its market debut in Hong Kong.",
      "The brand\u2019s success stems largely from its low prices and rapid expansion, especially in less developed cities, as Chinese people adjust their spending habits while grappling with job security and other economic concerns.",
      "Kelsey Yu, 23, a graduate student in Beijing, said she bought a bottle of lemonade from Mixue for the equivalent of less than $1 on a visit in April to the southern Chinese city of Jieyang.",
      "\u201cThe drink quenched my thirst. It had a large portion and was cheap,\u201d she said, adding that Mixue\u2019s items are \u201cbetter value for money\u201d than those of many local competitors.",
      "Yu said that as a foodie, she drinks tea-based beverages at least once or twice a week and may \u201cindulge a bit more\u201d while traveling.",
      "\u201cI usually order milk tea when I\u2019m feeling tired or if I just want to have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have self-control. So I won\u2019t have it every day.\u201d",
      "A complicated picture of Chinese consumption",
      "While U.S. officials often say Chinese consumers are not spending enough, the situation is not as clear-cut as it is portrayed, analysts said.",
      "In the past quarter-century, China\u2019s consumer spending has grown an average of 8% or more each year, one of the highest rates among major economies. But it has been outstripped by investment, making consumption a smaller part of China\u2019s overall GDP.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cSummer Davos\u201d event in Tianjin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said China sought to become a \u201cmega-sized consumption powerhouse.\u201d",
      "Boosted by government subsidies, China\u2019s retail sales grew 6.4% in May, the fastest rate since late 2023.",
      "Sales during this year\u2019s monthlong 618 online shopping festival, which ended June 18, were a record 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun, 15.2% higher than last year.",
      "Young Chinese in particular are \u201cliving frugally to spend big,\u201d according to state-backed research. Though they are budget-conscious when it comes to daily necessities, they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to splurge\u201d for their hobbies and happiness, it said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather spend 300 yuan ($42) on a great meal, and if the food is really good, I would think it\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Yu said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a 300-yuan piece of clothing, I might hesitate.\u201d",
      "Amid China\u2019s economic challenges, middle-class consumers are less brand-conscious and prefer cheaper alternatives, said Yaling Jiang, founder of ApertureChina, a consulting firm that specializes in consumer research.",
      "\u201cNow saving is seen as cool, and seeking value is seen as cool,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cI think the downturn definitely changed the culture of spending.\u201d",
      "Chinese mallgoers these days spend money almost exclusively on the first and second floors, where food and beverage shops are concentrated, Jiang said.",
      "\u201cPeople are walking around the mall with a cup of milk tea or coffee,\u201d she added, looking at what\u2019s available in stores before going home to buy cheaper alternatives online.",
      "China\u2019s luxury market, which had accounted for almost a third of global sales, declined 18% to 20% last year, according to a January report by Bain and Company.",
      "\u201cI think there is less focus on the social status comparison, and more focus on what brings them personal happiness,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING, a post-pandemic change that has also been seen elsewhere.",
      "Consumers in China are both trading up and spending down, depending on the sector, said Shan Guo, a partner at Hutong Research, an investment advisory group based in Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cThey are not buying luxury bags, but they are buying Pop Mart,\u201d  Guo said, referring to the Chinese retailer behind the Labubu toys. \u201cLabubu can be quite expensive.\u201d",
      "Despite concerns about slower economic growth in China and elsewhere, Lu, the Melbourne student, said her friends are still \u201cquite willing to spend for fun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re not big spenders,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re just happy to treat themselves when having a good time.\u201d"

      "Oslo Police Attorney Andreas Kruszewski said that H\u00f8iby was cooperative during police questioning, which is now complete. Evidence in the case was drawn from sources including text messages, witness testimonies and police searches, the police attorney said.",
      "The charges included one case of rape involving intercourse and two cases of rape without intercourse, four cases of sexual assault and two cases of bodily harm, Kruszewksi said at a news conference.",
      "\u201cI cannot go into further detail about the number of victims in the case beyond confirming that it is a double-digit number,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense attorney Petar Sekulic, in an email to The Associated Press, said H\u00f8iby was \u201cabsolutely taking the accusations very seriously, but doesn\u2019t acknowledge any wrongdoing in most of the cases \u2014 especially the cases regarding sexual abuse and violence.\u201d",
      "The royal palace said \u201cthe case is proceeding through the legal system and is following normal procedures. We have nothing further to add.\u201d",
      "The case was top news in Norway, where the royals are popular.",
      "H\u00f8iby previously lived with the royal couple and their two children, Princess Ingrid Alexandra and Prince Sverre Magnus, but now lives in a separate house nearby, according to Sekulic.",
      "H\u00f8iby remains free pending a possible trial and is entitled to a presumption of innocence until a court rules otherwise.",
      "Once known affectionately as \u201cLittle Marius,\u201d H\u00f8iby grew up in the public eye enjoying the same wealth and privilege as his royal siblings, although his biological father, Morton Borg, served time in prison for drugs and violent offenses. Hoiby has acknowledged cocaine use and addiction.",
      "Norway\u2019s future queen made headlines in 2001 when she married Haakon, because she was a single mother who had lived a freewheeling life with a companion who had been convicted on drug charges."

      "With well over a year until the 2026 midterm elections, Democrats and Republicans are already gearing up for expensive fights in House, Senate and governor\u2019s races across the country.",
      "Enter Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who is betting that there is a path to becoming Michigan\u2019s next governor without embracing either of those party labels.",
      "Duggan, a longtime Democrat who has served for over a decade as Detroit\u2019s mayor, announced in December that he would run an independent campaign to succeed Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who cannot run for a third term next year. It\u2019s an audacious bet, in one of the nation\u2019s most tightly divided swing states, that voters who say they are fed up with both parties are ready to back another choice.",
      "But while some of the political conditions seem ripe, recent independents running in three-way elections haven\u2019t been able to push that sentiment to victory.",
      "\u201cEvery place I go, the depth of anger at the two parties runs deep,\u201d Duggan told NBC News in an interview.",
      "He said he decided to run as an independent to escape the political expectations that come with serving one party or the other in Lansing, describing the current environment in the state capital as \u201ctoxic.\u201d Michigan currently has a divided state Legislature, with Democrats narrowly controlling the state Senate (and the governorship) while Republicans control the state House after wresting it back from Democrats in 2024.",
      "\u201cEvery single conversation in Lansing was, \u2018Will this bill help me keep the majority?\u2019 \u2018Will this bill help me get the majority?\u2019 And nobody was solving any problems,\u201d Duggan said. \u201cThey wanted to create a moment that they could [use to] send out fundraising appeals off of some type of conflict.\u201d",
      "Opportunity \u2014 and an uphill climb \u2014 for independent candidates",
      "Across the country, the appetite for third-party candidates is growing. A recent NBC News analysis found that Americans are increasingly registering to vote as unaffiliated voters, opting not to identify with a political party. Voters hold negative views of both parties, and the Democratic Party earlier this year notched its lowest ratings in 35 years of NBC News polling.",
      "Some prominent political figures have sought out a third option, away from both major parties. In the past three years, two former senators \u2014 Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona and Joe Manchin of West Virginia \u2014 left the Democratic Party and registered as independents.",
      "More recently, Elon Musk, a tech mogul and former adviser to President Donald Trump who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help him in 2024, posted on X amid a feud with Trump about the appetite for \u201ca new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle,\u201d though it\u2019s unclear how serious Musk was. (Duggan wrote in response to the Tesla and SpaceX CEO, \u201cNow you\u2019ve got my attention\u2026\u201d alongside a smiley emoji.)",
      "That sentiment aside, turning the broad idea of unhappiness with the two parties into actual statewide victory for an independent candidate is difficult, as recent years of elections show.",
      "In Oregon, former state Sen. Betsy Johnson mounted a well-funded independent campaign for governor in 2022, at times receiving almost 20% of voters\u2019 support in public polling. But on Election Day, Johnson received under 9% of the vote, with Democrat Tina Kotek winning the race.",
      "Last year in Nebraska, Navy veteran Dan Osborn ran an independent campaign for Senate that gained national attention. Democrats didn\u2019t field a candidate in the race and Osborn lost to incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer, a Republican, by over 6 points, though he held Fischer well below Trump\u2019s margin in the state.",
      "In Michigan, Duggan insists that he\u2019s received support from voters on both sides of the aisle, saying he\u2019s simply offering them a choice outside of the traditional two-party binary.",
      "\u201cThis whole evenly divided, Republican and Democrat \u2018attack each other every two years in an election cycle\u2019 isn\u2019t working for Michigan, and maybe I give the voters a different choice,\u201d Duggan said.",
      "A big race in a key state",
      "Duggan\u2019s presence adds another layer of complexity as both parties gear up for a competitive race.",
      "Though Whitmer won her second term by more than 10 points, Michigan is typically a tightly balanced battleground. In 2024, the state backed Trump for president by less than 2 points and Democrat Elissa Slotkin for Senate by an even slimmer margin. Four years earlier, Biden defeated Trump in the Great Lakes State by nearly 3 points.",
      "But Democrats and Republicans still have to sort out who their nominees for governor will be, and voters don\u2019t head to the polls in the state\u2019s primary until August of next year.",
      "On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson have launched campaigns to succeed Whitmer. Republican Rep. John James, state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt, former state House Speaker Tom Leonard and former state Attorney General Mike Cox have all jumped into the GOP primary.",
      "\u201c[Duggan] announced right at the beginning of the year, which gives him a full two years with no primary to get around the state and tell his story,\u201d Jason Roe, a Republican strategist in Michigan who is not currently working for any gubernatorial candidate, told NBC News.",
      "With Democrats and Republicans focused on their own primaries, \u201cthere\u2019s really no reward to any of those candidates to attack him,\u201d Roe said, adding: \u201cAnd so I think he gets to go around, you know, talking about rainbows and unicorns\u201d without getting attacked.",
      "Democrats have targeted Duggan recently, if not in a way many voters would have seen, accusing him of corruption in one digital ad funded by the Democratic Governors Association\u2019s Victory Fund in May.",
      "\u201cDuggan is running a self-serving campaign that has no path to victory,\u201d DGA communications director Sam Newton told NBC News in a statement, adding: \u201cThe DGA has beaten attention-grabbing third-party candidates before \u2014 and we\u2019re confident that we\u2019ll do it again in Michigan in 2026.\u201d",
      "Michigan Democratic Party Chair Curtis Hertel also slammed Duggan, telling NBC News that the mayor is only running as an independent because he didn\u2019t want to run in the Democratic primary.",
      "\u201cI think most of this is about Mike\u2019s ego. It was bruised by the fact that he couldn\u2019t actually win a Democratic primary,\u201d Hertel said. \u201cHe has very thin skin.\u201d",
      "On the other side of the aisle, Republicans haven\u2019t yet engaged in formal campaigning against Duggan. But one national Republican strategist noted that the Michigan race is going to be competitive \u2014 and expensive \u2014 next fall whether Duggan is drawing significant support or not.",
      "Roe noted Duggan\u2019s popularity in and around Detroit, adding that he\u2019s well-liked by Michigan\u2019s business leaders.",
      "\u201cPeople see the business community, the organized business community, migrating to him,\u201d he said.",
      "Roe, who lives in the suburban Detroit area, said that Republicans in his area seem particularly attracted to Duggan\u2019s campaign as well. But he cautioned against drawing conclusions about Duggan\u2019s popularity among partisans until after next year\u2019s primary.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a big but here. They don\u2019t have a binary choice. They don\u2019t know who the Republicans are. They don\u2019t know who Democrats are,\u201d he said.",
      "Hertel compared Duggan\u2019s support now to that of early support for previous independent candidates elsewhere.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen, a lot of times, with these independent candidates, is, you know, they get a lot of attention at first, but when we get closer to election time, people make different decisions,\u201d Hertel said.",
      "\u201cRight now it\u2019s, \u2018Well, I know Duggan, and I feel Duggan has done some great stuff in Detroit. No clue about these other people,\u2019 right?\u201d Roe said. \u201cOnce there\u2019s nominees, and you have three people to choose from, that will likely change.\u201d"

      "With Sudan in the grips of war and millions struggling to find enough to eat, many are turning to weeds and wild plants to quiet their pangs of hunger. They boil the plants in water with salt because, simply, there is nothing else.",
      "Grateful for the lifeline it offered, a 60-year-old retired school teacher penned a love poem about a plant called Khadija Koro. It was \u201ca balm for us that spread through the spaces of fear,\u201d he wrote, and kept him and many others from starving.",
      "A.H, who spoke on the condition his full name not be used, because he feared retribution from the warring parties for speaking to the press, is one of 24.6 million people in Sudan facing acute food insecurity \u2014nearly half the population, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. Aid workers say the war spiked market prices, limited aid delivery, and shrunk agricultural lands in a country that was once a breadbasket of the world.",
      "Sudan plunged into war in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces escalated to fighting in the capital Khartoum and spread across the country, killing over 20,000 people, displacing nearly 13 million people, and pushing many to the brink of famine in what aid workers deemed the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis.",
      "Food insecurity is especially bad in areas in the Kordofan region, the Nuba Mountains, and Darfur, where El Fasher and Zamzam camp are inaccessible to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Mathilde Vu, an aid worker with the group based in Port Sudan. Some people survive on just one meal a day, which is mainly millet porridge. In North Darfur, some people even sucked on coal to ease their hunger.",
      "On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the Sudanese military leader Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan and asked him for a week-long ceasefire in El Fasher to allow aid delivery. Burhan agreed to that request, according to an army statement, but it\u2019s unknown whether the RSF would agree to that truce.",
      "A.H. said aid distribution often provided slight relief. His wife in children live in Obeid and also struggle to secure enough food due to high prices in the market.",
      "His poem continued: \u201cYou were a world that sends love into the barren time. You were a woman woven from threads of the sun. You were the sandalwood and the jasmine and a revelation of green, glowing and longing.\u201d",
      "Fighting restricted travel, worsening food insecurity",
      "Sudanese agricultural minister Abu Bakr al-Bashari told Al-Hadath news channel in April that there are no indicators of famine in the country, but there is shortage of food supplies in areas controlled by the paramilitary forces, known as RSF.",
      "However, Leni Kinzli, World Food Programme Sudan spokesperson, said 17 areas in Gezeira, most of the Darfur region, and Khartoum, including Jebel Aulia are at risk of famine. Each month, over 4 million people receive assistance from the group, including 1.7 million in areas facing famine or at risk, Kinzli said.",
      "The state is suffering from two conflicts: one between the Rapid Support Forces and the army, and another with the People\u2019s Liberation Movement-North, who are fighting against the army and have ties with the RSF, making it nearly impossible to access food, clean water, or medicine.",
      "He can\u2019t travel to Obeid in North Kordofan to be with his family, as the Rapid Support Forces blocked roads. Violence and looting have made travel unsafe, forcing residents to stay in their neighborhoods, limiting their access to food, aid workers said.",
      "A.H. is supposed to get a retirement pension from the government, but the process is slow, so he doesn\u2019t have a steady income. He can only transfer around $35 weekly to his family out of temporary training jobs, which he says is not enough.",
      "Hassan, another South Kordofan resident in Kadugli said that the state has turned into a \u201clarge prison for innocent citizens\u201d due to the lack of food, water, shelter, income, and primary health services caused by the RSF siege.",
      "International and grassroots organizations in the area where he lives were banned by the local government, according to Hassan, who asked to be identified only by his first name in fear of retribution for speaking publicly while being based in an area often engulfed with fighting.",
      "So residents ate the plants out of desperation.",
      "\u201cYou would groan to give life an antidote when darkness appeared to us through the window of fear.,\u201d A.H. wrote in his poem. \u201cYou were the light, and when our tears filled up our in the eyes, you were the nectar.",
      "Food affordability",
      "Vu warned that food affordability is another ongoing challenge as prices rise in the markets. A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn\u2019t provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",

      "The potential deal would mark a major reversal in policy for President Trump, who pulled the U.S. out of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran in 2018 arguing in part that the sanctions relief and unfreezing of Iranian assets had provided a \u201clifeline of cash\u201d to the Iranian regime to continue its malign activities.",
      "Still, it is not immediately clear if the financial proposal or any negotiations between the U.S. and Iran will move forward.",

    "link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/big-beautiful-bill-ai-moratorium-ted-cruz-pass-vote-rcna215111",
    "published": "Sat, 28 Jun 2025 02:09:33 GMT",
    "summary": "Critics as varied as Marjorie Taylor Greene and the NAACP have come out against the rule, which would prevent states from passing AI regulations for 10 years.",
    "story": [
      "As Senate Republicans rush to pass their hodgepodge tax and spending package \u2014 the Big Beautiful Bill \u2014  controversy has arisen around an unusual provision: a 10-year moratorium on states passing their own laws regulating artificial intelligence.",
      "Congress has been slow to pass any regulation on AI, a rapidly evolving technology, leaving states to write their own laws. Those state laws largely focus on preventing specific harms, like banning the use deepfake technology to create nonconsensual pornography, to mislead voters about specific issues or candidates or to mimic music artists\u2019 voices without permission.",
      "Some major companies that lead the U.S. AI industry have argued that a mix of state laws needlessly hamstrings the technology, especially as the U.S. seeks to compete with China. But a wide range of opposition \u2014 including some prominent Republican lawmakers, child safety advocates and civil rights groups \u2014 say states are a necessary bulwark against a dangerous technology that can cause unknown harms within the next decade.",
      "The Trump administration has been clear that it wants to loosen the reins on AI\u2019s expansion. During his first week in office, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to ease regulations on the technology and revoke \u201cexisting AI policies and directives that act as barriers to American AI innovation.",
      "And in February, Vice President JD Vance gave a speech at an AI summit in Paris that made clear that the Trump administration wanted to prioritize AI dominance over regulation.",
      "But a Pew Research Center study in April found that far more Americans who are not AI experts are more concerned about the risks of AI than the potential benefits.",
      "\u201cCongress has just shown it can\u2019t do a lot in this space,\u201d Larry Norden, the vice president of the Elections and Government Program at the Brennan Center, a New York University-tied nonprofit that advocates for democratic issues, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cTo take the step to say we are not doing anything, and we\u2019re going to prevent the states from doing anything is, as far as I know, unprecedented. Especially given the stakes with this technology, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d Norden said.",
      "The provision in the omnibus package was introduced by the Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by Texas Republican Ted Cruz. Cruz\u2019s office deferred comment to the committee, which has issued an explainer saying that, under the proposed rule, states that want a share of a substantial federal investment in AI must \u201cpause any enforcement of any state restrictions, as specified, related to AI models, AI systems, or automated decision systems for 10 years.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the Senate Parliamentarian said that while some provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act are subject to a 60-vote threshold to determine whether or not they can remain in the bill, the AI moratorium is not one of them. Senate Republicans said they are aiming to bring the bill to a vote on Saturday.",
      "All Senate Democrats are expected to vote against the omnibus bill. But some Republicans have said they oppose the moratorium on states passing AI laws, including",
      "Sens. Josh Hawley of Arkansas, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.",
      "Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a staunch Trump ally, posted on X earlier this month that, when she signed the House version of the bill, she didn\u2019t realize it would keep states from creating their own AI laws.",
      "\u201cFull transparency, I did not know about this section,\u201d Greene wrote. \u201cWe have no idea what AI will be capable of in the next 10 years and giving it free rein and tying states\u2019 hands is potentially dangerous.\u201d",
      "Tennessee Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Republican on the Commerce Committee, has said she opposes the 10-year moratorium.",
      "\u201cWe cannot prohibit states across the country from protecting Americans, including the vibrant creative community in Tennessee, from the harms of AI,\u201d she said in a statement provided to NBC News. \u201cFor decades, Congress has proven incapable of passing legislation to govern the virtual space and protect vulnerable individuals from being exploited by Big Tech.\u201d",
      "State lawmakers and attorneys general of both parties also oppose the AI provision. An open letter signed by 260 state legislators expressed their \u201dstrong opposition\u201d to the moratorium. \u201cOver the next decade, AI will raise some of the most important public policy questions of our time, and it is critical that state policymakers maintain the ability to respond,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "Similarly, 40 state attorneys general from both parties manifested their opposition to the provision in a letter to Congress. \u201cThe impact of such a broad moratorium would be sweeping and wholly destructive of reasonable state efforts to prevent known harms associated with AI,\u201d they wrote.",
      "A Brennan Center analysis found that the moratorium would lead to 149 existing state laws being overturned.",
      "\u201cState regulators are trying to enforce the law to protect their citizens, and they have enacted common sense regulation that\u2019s trying to protect the worst kinds of harms that are surfacing up to them from their constituents,\u201d Sarah Meyers West, the co-executive director of the AI Now Institute, a nonprofit that seeks to shape AI to benefit the public, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re saying that we need to wait 10 years before protecting people from AI abuses. These things are live. They\u2019re affecting people right now,\u201d she said.",
      "AI and tech companies like Google and Microsoft have argued that the moratorium is necessary to keep the industry competitive with China.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s growing recognition that the current patchwork approach to regulating AI isn\u2019t working and will continue to worsen if we stay on this path,\u201d OpenAI\u2019s chief global affairs officer, Chris Lehane, wrote on LinkedIn. \u201cWhile not someone I\u2019d typically quote, Vladimir Putin has said that whoever prevails will determine the direction of the world going forward.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot afford to wake up to a future where 50 different states have enacted 50 conflicting approaches to AI safety and security,\u201d Fred Humphries, Microsoft\u2019s corporate vice president of U.S. government affairs, said in an emailed statement",
      "The pro-business lobby Chamber of Commerce released a letter, signed by industry groups like the Independent Petroleum Association of America and the Meat Institute, in support of the moratorium.",
      "\u201cMore than 1,000 AI-related bills have already been introduced at the state and local level this year. Without a federal moratorium, there will be a growing patchwork of state and local laws that will significantly limit AI development and deployment,\u201d they wrote.",
      "In opposition, a diverse set of 60 civil rights organizations, ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to digital rights groups to the NAACP, have signed their own open letter arguing for states to pass their own AI laws.",
      "\u201cThe moratorium could inhibit state enforcement of civil rights laws that already prohibit algorithmic discrimination, impact consumer protection laws by limiting the ability of both consumers and state attorneys general to seek recourse against bad actors, and completely eliminate consumer privacy laws,\u201d the letter reads.",
      "The nonprofit National Center on Sexual Exploitation opposed the moratorium on Tuesday, especially highlighting how AI has been used to sexually exploit minors.",
      "AI technology is already being used to generate child sex abuse material and to groom and extort minors, said Haley McNamara, the group\u2019s senior vice president of strategic initiatives and programs.",
      "\u201cThe AI moratorium in the budget bill is a Trojan horse that will end state efforts to rein in sexual exploitation and other harms caused by artificial intelligence. This provision is extremely reckless, and if passed, will lead to further weaponization of AI for sexual exploitation,\u201d McNamara said."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Rep. Don Bacon, a centrist Republican who represents a key battleground district in Nebraska, is planning to announce his retirement from Congress, according to two sources familiar with the situation.",
      "He is expected to make a formal announcement as soon as next week, when the House is poised to vote on President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping legislation dubbed the \u201cBig Beautiful Bill.\u201d",
      "Bacon did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday night.",
      "Follow here for live politics coverage.",
      "NOTUS and Punchbowl News first reported his retirement plans.",
      "Bacon has represented the state\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, which includes much of the Omaha metropolitan area, since 2017 when he defeated his Democratic opponent by less than 5,000 votes. Since then, Bacon has kept the seat in the GOP column but only narrowly emerged victorious in recent elections, including last year, when he won by less than 2 percentage points.",
      "Bacon\u2019s departure will provide Democrats an opportunity to pick up a seat in a district that has shown an appetite for supporting Democratic candidates on the ballot in recent elections.",
      "Then-Vice President Kamala Harris carried the district by nearly 5 percentage points in 2024 \u2014 making Bacon one of just three House Republicans to serve in a district Harris won. Joe Biden won Bacon\u2019s district by an even larger margin in 2020.",
      "Bacon has been among the few vocal Republican critics of Trump\u2019s agenda, sparring with the president at times over his use of tariffs and decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico, and accusing him of treating Russia with \u201cvelvet gloves.\u201d",
      "With his announcement, Bacon will join nearly half a dozen Republicans in the House who have opted against seeking re-election next year. Nine House Democrats also are not seeking re-election to their seats."

      "Typically wearing leisurewear, the Canadian radio show host looks into a camera in the soundproof studio she created in her basement. With a microphone propped in front of her, she records poems \u2014 ones she's written that cover complicated topics like friendships, broken hearts, body insecurities, aging and grief.",
      "And these poems have now been watched over 100 million times on TikTok alone (yes, we counted).",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t remember anyone I\u2019ve ever seen at a public pool with such a memorable body, good or bad, that I think about it ever again,\u201d begins what is her most popular poem thus far.",
      "In it, she reflects on all the aspects of a person that only briefly grab her attention \u2014 their body, their looks \u2014 before pivoting to what she does remember.",
      "\u201cWhen I talk about my friends, sometimes I will bother to note that they are beautiful, yes. But I will list the things that make them that way,\u201d she says.",
      "What began as a regulation exercise from her therapist has turned Balka into a viral sensation in late 20223, with the likes of John Mayer, Jennifer Aniston and Mel Robbins sharing her work. And now, with the release of her first book, \"I Hope You Remember,\" Balka can add New York Times bestselling author to her list of accolades. (Her second book, \"Loves of Our Lives,\" will be out January 2026.)",
      "\"It's hard to wrap my head around,\" she tells TODAY.com on the phone as she sat on her porch earlier this month. \"It just doesn't feel real.\"",
      "Balka spoke with TODAY.com about her sudden viral rise, how quickly she can whip up a poem, the themes to which she keeps returning and whether her fianc\u00e9 is terrified about writing his own wedding vows (spoiler alert: he is).",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "The one thing that I worry about the most is the people that I know thinking that it\u2019s not cool. I love that quote that\u2019s like, \"It\u2019s only cringy until it works.\" I feel like at first, I was a little bit more sensitive to any negativity, which there honestly hasn\u2019t been a ton of, which is really nice because I know on the internet when I post other kinds of content, there can be. But usually with poems, it\u2019s pretty positive. Anybody who\u2019s being mean on the internet, I would never admire those people, so I find that I can\u2019t be scared of them either.",
      "I had one go super viral at the end of 2023, the public pool one. And that was kind of the first one that I was like, \u201cWoah, what just happened?\u201d I think as kind of unfortunate as it is, one of the main ways that I want to push forward is when people are encouraging me to do so, and sometimes it does take a little bit of enforcement. And being encouraged by celebrities that I\u2019ve looked up to for a long time, I was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe it. This could be something.\u201d",
      "I believe that I had just gone shopping or was looking at bathing",
      "Some of the most resonating things are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way.",
      "Josie balka",
      "suits online and I was just thinking about how crappy of an experience that always is for me. And I just have never, ever put any significance into why I love somebody based on their body. I kind of was like, \u201cWhy are you so worried that everyone's looking at you when you\u2019ve never looked at anybody else and remembered them?\u201d",
      "It kind of spiraled into all these other reasons that describe why people care about who you are and not how you look, and different scenarios in your life. I feel like it\u2019s a really important thing to remember.",
      "I lost over 100 pounds, and I have lots of trauma from it. I\u2019ve had a few surgeries for loose skin and that kind of stuff. After my first plastic surgery for my lower body, I got sepsis and almost died. It's crazy that I did this for how I looked, and then I almost died. And it didn\u2019t make me any happier. It just made me feel smaller, and I kind of thought that was the only thing I needed or wanted.",
      "And then there was kind of a big realization when I got to my goal. I still had all these things to work through and my happiness was never really dependent on the way that I looked in the way that I thought. I think there\u2019s a lot of people who sit around saying, \u201cWell, if I just lost 10 pounds \u2026 if I didn\u2019t have this loose skin, my life would be so much better.\u201d But there\u2019s no end goal, you just find something else. The way you look will never be the only thing. And I feel like I\u2019ve learned that firsthand a lot over the last few years.",
      "Some of the most resonating things I find are the things that I\u2019m sitting here thinking I\u2019m the only one who feels that way, because I truly don\u2019t think there are many unique experiences. Often if you just say the one thing that you carry the most shame over out loud, you\u2019ll find 100 other people that feel that way too. That\u2019s kind of why I leaned into it.",
      "It goes both ways.  Every time somebody goes, \"Oh, I really related to this thing, it made me feel less alone,\" I get to be like, \"Oh, because you related to this, now I know that I\u2019m not alone in that thought.\" I hope that other people scrolling through the comment section of a video they resonate with are seeing 100 other people that are like, \"Me too, me too, me too.\" And we can make everyone feel less alone together.",
      "I would have to have more of a routine with it. I usually just write down ideas as they come to me. I'll think of a line while I\u2019m driving or at work and I\u2019ll just type it into my phone. Eventually I\u2019ll scroll through all the one-liners on my notes app and expand on one of them. And if I feel like it\u2019s good enough, I\u2019ll go downstairs in my studio and record and post it. I\u2019d say 99% of the time, I write, record and post all in the same night.",
      "He was not wanting to do vows in front of people. He is very loving and very sweet and he\u2019s not shy to tell me how he feels but he is definitely shy to speak in front of a crowd. Originally he was like, \u201cCan we please just do private vows?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNope, I want to do them in front of everybody.\u201d So we are going to do them.",
      "I honestly don\u2019t think they will be that crazy or that amazing. They\u2019ll be pretty personalized, it\u2019ll probably be the way I would talk to him on a normal day.",
      "I think that\u2019s kind of the scary thing about success: It never feels like enough. Like everything after, if it\u2019s not quite up to par, you always feel like you didn\u2019t do as good a job, you know? Obviously in my head, I hope for success moving forward. But I also just hope to keep enjoying it. I love doing it, it\u2019s my total passion. It\u2019s my journal entries come to life. It\u2019s what my therapist told me to do to get regulated. I couldn\u2019t be more grateful that it\u2019s turned into something like this, and I just hope that I continue to love that and I continue to be able to connect with people.",
      "I remember saying to my therapist once at the beginning, \"What if I can\u2019t continue it? What if I can\u2019t maintain it?\" And she was like, \"Nobody can ever take away what\u2019s already happened.\" So I think that I get to move forward knowing that what\u2019s already happened is mine. Obviously I hope for more of it, but even if all I got was what I have, I would be so happy to have it."

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to come from this, and I don\u2019t know where his heart lies. I just know how I feel.\u201d",
      "Hannah also acknowledges her complicated feelings about Charlie, too: \u201cI think with Charlie as well, I don\u2019t know where his heart lies now. Obviously a lot has happened since he\u2019s left, and that can\u2019t be easy to witness.\u201d",
      "For now, she\u2019s acknowledges that the \u201creal world\u201d is much different than the villa, where around-the-clock proximity plays a big role.",
      "She adds, \u201cI think it\u2019s a waiting game to see where everything lies out and what really aligns for us, and see if we really work outside of the villa.\u201d",
      "Did Hannah Hope Pepe Would Leave With Her?",
      "Feelings are always heightened immediately following dumpings, and Hannah\u2019s was no exception. Was there any part of Hannah that thought Pepe might feel strongly enough to leave with her?",
      "\u201cHe had kind of mentioned it, but I just don\u2019t really think that it was an option,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cEven when Charlie left, I had thought about leaving. I think I had told Iris, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to go,\u2019 but I just don\u2019t think it was an actual option to leave. I don\u2019t really know exactly. Maybe it is.\u201d",
      "Despite her disappointment in leaving her connection behind in Fiji, Hannah holds no grudges against Pepe for staying.",
      "\u201cI kind of had told him, \u2018Don\u2019t ruin your experience.\u2019 I wanted him to have the best experience, and I don\u2019t hold it against him for not leaving at all, definitely. But you know I wish that he could have.\u201d",
      "Who Does Hannah See Winning \u2018Love Island USA\u2019?",
      "Despite the girls choosing to send her home, Hannah maintains that they will remain close.",
      "\u201cI think our sisterhood is really, really strong,\u201d Hanna tells TODAY.com. \u201cI think obviously there were moments where we\u2019d have little, you know, back-and-forth arguments \u2014 but honestly not really. There were only a couple notable ones and we really bounced back super fast from that.\u201d",
      "She mentions Huda, who had pursued Pepe briefly without being upfront with Hannah about it.",
      "\u201cI did have that falling out with Huda and we never really resolved that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think that\u2019s something that would need to be resolved post-villa, but I\u2019m not closing myself off to any of them.\u201d",
      "Drama aside, Hannah maintains hope for her villa friendships and even has someone she\u2019s rooting to win.",
      "\u201cEven though she hurt my feelings, I really hope that Cierra, either with Nic or this new connection with Elan, I hope that she really gets her man,\u201d Hannah says. \u201cI think she\u2019s really deserving, and I think that she\u2019s somebody who really was there for the true reason of finding a partner.\u201d",
      "As for watching the rest of the season? \u201cOh, yes I will, absolutely. Even if I wasn\u2019t on the show, I would\u2019ve watched the show the whole time.\u201d"

      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas plays Tina Marrero on the hit Hulu series, who takes a line cook job at Chicago's Original Beef after being laid off from her longtime office job. When Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) takes over the restaurant, Tina is forced to either evolve or leave. She chooses the former, eventually becoming a sous chef at The Bear, finding a home in the found family that includes Carmy, Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) and Natalie (Abby Elliott).",
      "Much like her character, Col\u00f3n-Zayas, too, has undergone her own transformation.",

      "Born and raised in New York City, Col\u00f3n-Zayas pursued a stage career and found modest success in theater before transitioning to television, where she's played a variety of parts over a span of three decades, doggedly pursuing the break \"The Bear\" eventually delivered.",
      "The struggles to get through the day has been really profoundly anxiety-producing for me as an actor. And I look at Tina\u2019s journey and I just get it.\u201d",
      "Liza Col\u00f3n-Zayas",
      "\"It's been a long struggle. It's been a lot of rejection. Hundreds of rejections. So, I understand Tina's resentment for these millennials that she feels are pushing her out. And she has very little to begin with and she's just trying to take care of her family,\" she says. \"I get it.\"",
      "Tina's combination of grit, independence and raw vulnerability has made her a fan-favorite character on the show. In 2024, Col\u00f3n-Zayas' performance won her an Emmy for outstanding supporting actress in a comedy, adding to the impressive collection of awards the show has picked up since premiering in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the writing, but it\u2019s also that vulnerability of opening up and saying, \u2018Here\u2019s all of this mess, all of this stuff that we have been programmed to hide and not express. Yet, we all work walking around with this stuff,\u2019\u201d Col\u00f3n-Zayas says.",
      "While the show has historically competed in the comedy category, \"The Bear\" is known for its emotional resonance with audiences, which Col\u00f3n-Zayas credits to the show's exploration of family.",
      "\"That is such a huge part of why The Bear family is together and is protecting each other. We all have these demons. I think this show resonates with so many people because they're like, 'Yeah, that was my family on Christmas. Yeah, that's me trying to find a job,'\" says Col\u00f3n-Zayas. \"So I'm grateful that these stories have been told because I think, I'm not the only one.\"",

      "Fans of \"The Bear\" will likely remember Col\u00f3n-Zayas singing karaoke in a bar full of people, most of them half her age, in Episode 5 of Season 2. Her emotional rendition of \"Before the Next Teardrop Falls\" was one of Tina's turning points in the series and something Col\u00f3n-Zayas says was completely \"terrifying.\"",
      "\"I'm from theater. I'm not from musical theater, so I don't sing,\" she explains, adding that the daunting scene was also filmed live.",
      "\"There's no auto-tuning going on. This sound is coming through these bar speakers. Like, it wasn't a pretty sound. There was no going back and redoing those scenes, singing in a smoother, prettier way,\" she says.",
      "The performance was not only a win for Col\u00f3n-Zayas, but also for her character, who, despite insecurity, stands up and allows herself to truly be seen. Col\u00f3n-Zayas says it represented her character \u201cpushing through that fear ... rather than just assuming that these people are going to shut me out.\"",
      "It's also a moment that marks Tina's willingness to be vulnerable, take risks and accept her place in The Bear's family.",
      "\"Those are the very same people who are embracing me and giving me a second chance,\" she says of her character's coworkers.",
      "It's not much different off screen, with Col\u00f3n-Zayas calling \"The Bear\" cast her \"kids,\" adding, \"They're so talented and fun.\"",
      "Paralleling Tina\u2019s journey, Col\u00f3n-Zayas says she's found her own second chance through the success of \u201cThe Bear.\u201d",
      "\u201cComing out on this side, I\u2019m a work in progress, but I am accepting that as long as I am proud of the work and doing the best I can, and protect my integrity, there are others around me that are noticing, who are respecting that, and who want that in the world,\" she says. \"And so I\u2019m just learning to rewire my brain.\u201d",
      "\u2018Doomsday Could be Coming\u2019 in Season 4",
      "Col\u00f3n-Zayas previewed Season 4, which dropped in full June 25, on TODAY with Jenna and Friends, saying, \u201cWe go much deeper in our own personal responsibility and reckoning.\u201d",
      "She also promised that \u201cof course,\u201d the season features the show\u2019s signature sense of heightened anxiety that comes from the fast-paced restaurant setting.",

      "\u201cThey asked me, \u2018What\u2019s your preferences?\u2019 So I just said, '45 to 60,' just being honest,\u201d he recalled. \u201cAnd then the process went and I was selected and then we had lunch with the executive producer. I said, \u2018You know, if they\u2019re 60 or over, I\u2019m cutting them.\u2019\u201d",

      "\"So he goes, 'You can't use the word cut.' I go, 'Well that's an NFL term,'\" he said.",
      "Owens then touched on the selection process for the women on the show and said he has \"no say\" in who's chosen to be on the series. Although he's confident that the women are \"going to be beautiful,\" he said he does have a few more preferences when it comes to dating.",
      "\"They got to be fit because I\u2019m staying in shape and work out and stuff. And I told them, 'Try to stay away from the artificial hips and the wigs,'\" he shared.",

      "TODAY.com reached out to Warner Bros. and ABC for comment but has not heard back yet.",

      "\"Ok thanks #TheGoldenBachelor and ABC for the heads up so I know NOT to watch this loser on TV,\" one person wrote on X in regards to Owens.",
      "Another said, \"The new \u2018Golden Bachelor\u2019, age discriminates!! He is 66 years old, but says any woman over 60 will be cut!!! I won\u2019t be watching him.\"",
      "A third said, \"Mel Owens & @ABCNetwork @GoldenBachABC can take their ageist BS & shove it! #BoycottABC \"",

    "story": [
      "Raymond Ablack is just as invested in \u201cGinny & Georgia\u2019s\u201d rollercoaster relationships as fans are.",
      "In a recent interview with TODAY.com, the actor who plays Joe opened up about his character\u2019s emotional journey this season \u2014 from heartbreak to potential new beginnings \u2014 and what might lie ahead for Joe and Georgia.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been rooting for Joe and Georgia for a long time as well,\u201d Ablack says.",
      "Joe and Georgia\u2019s connection has been a decades long slow burn. The two first met as teenagers in a flashback scene, when Joe showed Georgia an unexpected act of kindness during a difficult time in her life. Years later, they crossed paths again after Georgia moved to Wellsbury, Massachusetts, with her two children, Ginny (Brianne Howey) and Austin (Diesel La Torraca), and a troubled past she couldn\u2019t leave behind. Since then, their relationship has remained unresolved, marked by tension, bad timing and unspoken feelings that have kept viewers invested.",
      "Fans have watched Joe carry a torch for Georgia since Season 1. And while Georgia has been in and out of relationships, Ablack believes their timing might be right. The two finally get together in Season 3.",
      "\u201cHe confesses his feelings for her (again) because they haven\u2019t changed,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cThe timing is starting to become right for her.\u201d",
      "But, Ablack says, Georgia and Joe are not quite ready to get together. For one, Georgia is newly divorced from Paul (Scott Porter), the mayor. Then there are the legal troubles. She\u2019s currently on trial for the murder of Cynthia\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) husband and the Department of Child Services has temporarily removed her children, Ginny and Austin, from her custody. With so much unresolved, Joe and Georgia\u2019s future remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know that they\u2019re together in perfect harmony just yet,\u201d Ablack says of the pair. \u201cGeorgia needs to take some time and give some attention to her kids who need her right now \u2026 so they understand each other, but they\u2019re not getting involved yet.\u201d",
      "Ablack thinks Joe is waiting for Georgia to be ready.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that Joe has any judgment for Georgia,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants her to feel any kind of shame \u2026 if she were ready today to be together romantically, I think he would be very open to it.\u201d",
      "The topic of timing comes up between Joe and Georgia this season. In one episode, Joe pointedly questions the timeline of Georgia\u2019s relationship with her ex, Paul. For example, in a tense scene, a drunk Paul reveals to Joe that he had been intimate with Georgia. Joe, clearly unsettled, repeatedly asks Paul when it happened, pressing for specifics.",
      "Ablack says Joe\u2019s reaction isn\u2019t about jealousy, but about seeking clarity.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s trying to understand when and how real their relationship could be,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cIf they had sex after Joe and Georgia had that conversation, it would hurt Joe\u2019s feelings a little bit.\u201d",
      "The season ends with a cliffhanger: Georgia is pregnant. With unresolved feelings for Joe and a recent relationship with Paul, it\u2019s unclear who the father is.",
      "When asked how Joe would feel if he were the father, Ablack says, \u201cI think he would love to be the father of Georgia\u2019s child. Joe is great with kids \u2026 he\u2019s a pushover and a teddy bear.\u201d",
      "Even if he\u2019s not the biological father, Ablack believes Joe would fully embrace a parental role.",
      "\u201cI think Ginny and Austin could bully him into getting whatever they want,\u201d Ablack says with a laugh. \u201cHe would enjoy being manipulated.\u201d",
      "The actor also predicts how Joe\u2019s growing relationship with Georgia might affect her kids.",
      "\u201cI think (Ginny) would be a cheerleader for the relationship,\u201d Ablack says. \u201cBut I have no idea how Austin will respond to a new relationship. I hope that Joe will still approach everyone with love and compassion.\u201d",
      "This season, Joe remained loyal to Georgia through her legal troubles, something Ablack appreciated about his character.",
      "\u201cWhen push comes to shove and she\u2019s on trial for murder, I always felt that Joe was steadfast and noble,\u201d he says. \u201cHe showed up for her at all times.\u201d",
      "Despite the potential drama \u2014 and a possible baby daddy bombshell \u2014 Ablack said Joe\u2019s devotion to Georgia is unwavering.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that could happen\u2026 that would impede his love for her,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019ll always love her no matter what.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After three seasons, hundreds of deaths, billions of Korean won handed out, and a seemingly infinite rollercoaster of twists and turns, \u201cSquid Game\u201d has now dropped its final episodes on Netflix.",
      "A series that wasn\u2019t originally designed for a second season, \u201cSquid Game\u201d became a phenomenon with hundreds of millions of views around the world.",
      "Season 1 introduced audiences to the Korean series in which a secret game show was played on a remote island for the benefit of a few, wealthy, masked, VIPs, with only one winner allowed to take home the prize.",
      "Seasons 2 and 3 returned that winner (Lee Jung-jae, who played Seong Gi-hun, aka Player 456) to the arena, but also delved into the lives of the armed, pink-suited guards and a bulldog detective determined to shut the whole system down.",
      "Now that the final game (or so we think) has been played, who were the winners? Who were the losers? Let\u2019s dig into what we know. But beware \u2014 things get dark in this \u201cGame.\u201d",
      "Warning: Spoilers for all of \"Squid Game\" ahead.",
      "Does Player 456 die in 'Squid Game'? Seong Gi-hun's fate, explained",
      "Gi-hun went through the wringer in Seasons 2 and 3. He brought himself back into the game in order to subvert it, believing that his experience could foment a rebellion among the players. It turned out in the game \u2014 as often in real life \u2014 players preferred to vote for their own personal interests, rather than what was best for the collective, a brutal metaphor.",
      "Disillusioned by humanity after several of the games, Gi-hun checked out of active participation as much as he could \u2014 until circumstances brought him a baby to protect during the game. The baby was given its late mother\u2019s (Jo Yuri, playing Kim Jun-hee, aka Player 222) number, and permitted to \u201cparticipate\u201d in her stead.",
      "In the final round of the Game, Gi-hun and the baby made it to the last stage. They\u2019d had to face off numerous final players in the last test, which involved pushing players from the top of several tall towers. But on the final tower, Gi-hun, the baby, and Player 333 (Yim Si-wan, playing Lee Myung-gi, the baby\u2019s father) were the only ones left standing. The rules dictated that one person on the tower must die for the game to end, but that person had to die after a button on the tower is pressed. Gi-hun and Myung-gi fight \u2014 and Myung-gi fell from the tower.",
      "Unfortunately, the button wasn't pushed before he fell, so time had not started and the death didn't count. A death was still required to end the game. The VIPs in their protected booth expected Gi-hun to sacrifice the baby \u2014 but they clearly didn't know him well. There's no real winning at Squid Game, the show seemed to be saying \u2014 all that money didn\u2019t make Gi-hun\u2019s life a whole lot better. So Gi-hun kissed the baby, put her on the ground and turn to the camera to say, \u201cWe are not horses. We are humans.\u201d Then he fell from the tower and died.",
      "It\u2019s a bittersweet ending, but a profound one \u2014 and answered the question Front Man asked Gi-hun in Season 3: \u201cDo you still have faith in people?\u201d",
      "By not sacrificing an innocent baby, we got Gi-hun\u2019s final answer.",
      "So, who wins \u2018Squid Game\u2019 in Season 3?",
      "Player 222, the infant.",
      "What about the detective, Jun-ho, who\u2019s been investigating the Squid Game?",
      "Hwang Jun-ho (played by Wi Ha-joon) was too late to save Gi-hun, but he was able to send the Korean Coast Guard to the island.",
      "Jun-ho did rescue the escaped Player 246 (Park Gyeong-seok, played by Lee Jin-wook), whose daughter was hospitalized with leukemia.",
      "Jun-ho arrived on the island, looking for his brother (In-ho, aka Front Man, played by Lee Byung-hun), making it to the VIP chamber \u2014 just as In-ho retrieved Player 222/the baby from the top of the final tower.",
      "Jun-ho considered shooting his brother, but couldn't, afraid of harming the baby. Six months after the game ended, Jun-ho found the baby and the game\u2019s prize money left for him (probably by In-ho).",
      "Does the pink-suited guard No-eul survive?",
      "Kang No-eul (aka Guard 011, played by Park Gyuyoung), had lost her daughter and bonded with Player 246\u2019s child before coming to the island as a guard.",
      "But when she discovered the organ harvesting operation going on between the guards and the dead players, she stepped up her efforts to help Player 246 escape.",
      "She destroyed all evidence he had been on the island, and was prepared to die in the Front Man\u2019s office when she saw Gi-hun\u2019s sacrifice. Hearing the baby, she decided not to kill herself.",
      "Six months later, she showed up visiting Player 246 in the amusement park where he still works, and where she used to work in a costume. He remained unaware that she was the one who saved his life, since she had her pink suit and mask on the whole time. She reunited with Player 246\u2019s daughter, now healthy.",
      "But there\u2019s a twist: No-eul is a North Korean defector who was separated from her daughter. She gets news the child might be alive in China. We last see No-eul at the airport, ready to get on a plane to possibly visit her daughter.",
      "If that sounds familiar, it\u2019s similar to the way Season 1 ended, with Gi-hun about to go see his own daughter in Los Angeles.",
      "Does Gi-hun live on?",
      "Kind of. When we first met Gi-hun in Season 1, one reason he got into the Game in the first place was so he could support his daughter. But after he won, he became obsessed with ending the game.",
      "With Gi-hun dead, In-ho (Front Man) made the trip Gi-hun didn\u2019t: He went to the U.S. to see the late player\u2019s daughter. He handed over a box of Gi-hun\u2019s belongings to his daughter \u2014 a bloody uniform and a debit card, which probably had the remainder of Gi-hun\u2019s winnings on it. Did In-ho change his own opinion about humanity\u2019s worth? It seemed he was preparing to do so.",
      "Will there be more \u2018Squid Game\u2019?",
      "Based on the final scenes, we suspect yes.",
      "In the last scene, after In-ho finished dropping off the winnings to Gi-hun\u2019s daughter, he spotted a woman playing the introductory card-slap game with someone in an alley. And not just anybody \u2014 he saw a Recruiter, played by Cate Blanchett! They didn't speak to each other, though she nodded with recognition at him and he moved on.",
      "Season 1 informed us that Squid Games are played around the world, and last October Deadline reported that an English-language version of the series was being developed with director David Fincher. Maybe we\u2019ve just seen the first scene in \u201cSquid Game: USA\u201d?"

    "story": [
      "Spoilers ahead for \"Love Island USA\"  Season 7, Episode 21.",
      "Where in the world have Nic and Olandria gone on \u201cLove Island USA\u201d? That was the big question left heading into Season 7, Episode 21.",
      "In the episode prior, original islanders Olandria and Nic had been eliminated from the show in two dramatic re-couplings. Six of the guy bombshells in Casa Amor were tasked with choosing among the seven girl islanders to couple with, and Olandria was left as the single one out. Nic, who had been among the six guy islanders left back at the villa, exited in the same situation.",
      "The girls in Casa had tearfully bid adieu to Olandria \u2014 and just after the guys said farewell to Nic, a twist threw things for a loop. A black car pulled up to the villa to greet Nic \u2014 and there was Olandria, ready to take him \u2026 well, where?",
      "So that\u2019s where Episode 21 picks up. Here\u2019s what happened next.",
      "What Happens With Nic and Olandria?",
      "The end of the last episode left viewers eager to know what happens with Nic and Olandria. Were they leaving the island or not?",
      "Episode 21 answers those questions: The black car takes Nic and Olandria to \u2026 a date. They sit at a table for two beneath twinkle lights, sipping Champagne as they debrief the last few days.",
      "\u201cI have so much to tell you,\u201d Nic says. \u201cI want to hear everything.\u201d",
      "Olandria tells Nic about Cierra, who had spent her few days at Casa Amor getting to know a bombshell named Elan. Cierra had been conflicted about this, however, because she already had strong feelings for Nic back at the villa. Nic, meanwhile, had told Cierra before Casa Amor that he wanted to keep seeking other connections.",
      "\u201cThat worries me,\u201d Nic tells Olandria. \u201cI told her I wanted to be open because I want to test this connection, but I felt like she wanted to be closed off. But then now I\u2019m sitting here, like, I didn\u2019t find anybody. And she found somebody in Casa. It\u2019s going to be a test, for sure.\u201d",
      "Now Nic tells Olandria about Taylor. He had been vibing in the villa with a bombshell named Clarke, though he and Olandria had a maintained a connection before Casa.",
      "\u201cTaylor\u2019s my good friend, but I\u2019m putting that off to the side right now,\u201d Nic says. \u201cThe girl I was coupled up with, Clarke, chose him at the re-coupling. He feels this emotional connection with her. And he also feels this physical connection with her.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re able to take my man from me, Taylor was never mine to begin with,\u201d Olandria says to Nic.",
      "Then Nic gets a text: He and Olandria both now have a choice. They can each remain single but they must leave the island tonight \u2014 or they can couple up and return to the villa together.",
      "Olandria\u2019s in favor of coupling to return to the villa. Then Nic adds, \u201cI just want to say, I\u2019ve been wanting to get to know you. I feel like we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to get these conversations.\u201d",
      "Olandria agrees \u2014 she felt Nic had a lot going on with Cierra and Belle-A and didn\u2019t want to insert herself.",
      "So that\u2019s when Nic and Olandria execute a plan to get back to the villa. After the guy islanders and girl bombshells head to bed, Nic and Olandria sneak back in. They get into their PJs, creep into the bedroom and crawl into the same bed as a new couple.",
      "As the sun rises, the viewers see what happens. They\u2019re all shocked \u2014 sort of? \u2014 to see Olandria and Nic back at the villa. Nic tells the rest of he guy islanders about what he learned about Casa from Olandria. Taylor seems like he\u2019s in the biggest pickle: He\u2019s vibing with Clarke, but that could get weird now that Olandria\u2019s back.",
      "Later, Nic and Olandria chat a bit about their own situation in Soul Ties. Nic says he felt a connection with Olandria from the beginning of the show. Olandria is smitten but admits in a confessional that this is complicated; Taylor is one of Nic\u2019s closest friends, while she and Cierra are also tight.",
      "After a challenge between Casa and the villa, Nic and Olandria wrap the night with a chat in Soul Ties.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s a strong physical connection between Olandria and me,\u201d Nic says in a confessional. \u201cShe\u2019s one of the most attractive people I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime.\u201d",
      "Just after cutting to Cierra \u2014 who\u2019s says in a confessional that she\u2019d be upset if Nic had found a connection back at the villa \u2014 the episode wraps as Olandria and Nic share a steamy kiss."

    "story": [
      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d promises to be an action-packed film, showcasing the fast-paced and entertaining world of Formula 1.",
      "Brad Pitt stars as Sonny Hayes, a former F1 driver from the '90s who had a promising career until an accident on the track nearly ended his life. Thirty years later, his friend and owner of a struggling Formula 1 team, Ruben Cervantes (Javier Bardem), convinces him to return to the sport. This time, he's driving alongside the team's hotshot rookie, Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), attempting to work together and nab some wins.",
      "\u201cIt was a thrill to do,\u201d producer Jerry Bruckheimer tells TODAY.com, describing the film as an \u201cemotional journey we take you on.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what we love about this movie. It\u2019s a redemption story.\u201d",
      "F1 has become more popular in the U.S. following the release of Netflix\u2019s \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d now in its seventh season. U.S. viewership of the motorsport is also growing. ESPN recently said that F1 telecasts across ABC, ESPN and ESPN2 are averaging 1.3 million viewers, up over the 2023 season and 2024 season average of 1.1 million per race.",
      "With more people getting into Formula 1, many are curious about the events in the film and if they are inspired by real-life people. Bruckheimer, director Joseph Kosinski and the cast break it down.",
      "Is 'F1 The Movie' Based on a True Story?",
      "No, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d is not based on a true story.",
      "However, Bruckheimer and Kosinski enlisted seven-time Formula 1 world champion Lewis Hamilton as a producer and adviser to make the film as authentic as possible.",
      "Did 'F1 The Movie' Film at Real Races?",
      "Yes, \u201cF1 The Movie\u201d was filmed during real Grand Prix weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons.",
      "Real F1 drivers from the 10 teams were also included in the film, as well as team principals like Ferrari's Fred Vasseur and Mercedes' Toto Wolff, among other notable figures.",
      "According to Bruckheimer, the film crew built their own garage and six modified Formula 2 cars designed by Mercedes. Kosinski also noted that the team developed a camera system from scratch that was small enough to mount on the car to show the experience of what it feels like to drive one of the vehicles.",
      "\u201cWe had track time at every race,\u201d Bruckheimer says, explaining that they would get a couple of minutes in between qualifying or practice to film the fictional APXGP team with the other teams.",
      "\u201cWhat was exciting for our actors is, first of all, they\u2019re driving these cars at high speeds in front of 140,000 people and ... 100 million people on television, nobody knew that Brad and Damson were driving these cars,\u201d he adds. \u201cThen we had the track when the teams weren\u2019t there.\u201d",
      "Pitt also told TODAY during a surprise appearance at a New York screening about his experience driving the car.",
      "\u201cOur first scene was on the grid during race weekend at Silverstone (home of British Grand Prix events), where F1 started, and we were on the grid with the drivers,\u201d he told Savannah Guthrie. \u201cWe got one take, and we\u2019re moving on. And it just led to this great kind of energy you\u2019ll see that I think shows on the screen.\u201d",
      "Calling the action \u201csuch a thrill,\u201d he said, \u201cIt\u2019s so hard to explain what these cars can do. We would be barreling down the straight at 180, and you think that\u2019s something. But the fact that these cars can brake, can stop and make a complete right turn, it feels like the car is going to flip, and it sticks. It is unbelievable. It\u2019s unbelievable what these drivers can do.\u201d",
      "Were Any Characters Inspired by Real F1 Figures?",
      "No, most characters were created for the film. However, some actors drew inspiration from a number of people for their role.",
      "Kerry Condon, who portrays Kate McKenna, the technical director for team APXGP, tells TODAY.com she drew inspiration from Bernie Collins, an F1 strategy analyst for Sky Sports and F1TV and former F1 strategy engineer for the Aston Martin F1 team.",
      "\u201cWe did take a bit of an artistic license where I play a strategist in certain parts of the movie with the tires and stuff,\u201d Condon says. \u201cI was like, I\u2019ll just do everything. But Bernie had a similar education to me, (went to an) all-girls school and stuff, so I kind of brought in a lot of my own background and made it my own.\u201d",
      "Bardem says Ruben was not inspired by anyone in particular, but more of \u201ca mix of different team owners that I would meet or see on documentaries and and just put them together.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1 The Movie\u201d is in theaters on June 27."

    "summary": "If Iran opts to pursue a clandestine nuclear weapons project, the regime would have to shore up its heavily compromised security, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Iran\u2019s top nuclear scientist was driving to his country house with his wife on an autumn day four years ago. As he slowed down for a speed bump, a remote-controlled machine gun mounted on a nearby pick-up truck fired a volley of bullets, killing him instantly, Iranian authorities said.",
      "The assassination of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, the architect of a dormant nuclear weapons project known as Project Amad, illustrated in brutal fashion how deeply Israel had penetrated Iran. That vulnerability has only been exposed further in recent weeks, with Israeli air strikes killing several other scientists believed to be involved in Iran\u2019s nuclear work.",
      "Iran\u2019s political leaders now face a dilemma. After the heavy U.S. bombing of their nuclear sites and air defenses, they can strike a painful compromise with Washington and abandon their uranium enrichment program, or revive the secret weapons project masterminded by Fakhrizadeh.",
      "Unlike other countries that were able to develop nuclear weapons in secret, Iran cannot assume it will be able to keep its work hidden. Israel has demonstrated repeatedly it can evade Iran\u2019s security, uncover its clandestine nuclear activities and hunt down senior figures in the military, former intelligence officials and experts said.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s principal challenge in pursuing a covert pathway is going to be keeping it hidden from U.S. and Israeli detection,\u201d said Eric Brewer, a former intelligence official now with the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a nonprofit focusing on global security.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the key challenge, because both countries, particularly Israel, have demonstrated an ability to penetrate Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd Israel has demonstrated an ability to use kinetic force to take it out.\u201d",
      "The Israeli air force has effectively wiped out Iran\u2019s air defenses. For the moment, Iran cannot protect any target on its territory -- especially suspected nuclear sites -- from a U.S. or Israeli bombing raid, former intelligence officials said.",
      "\u201cThe Israelis have complete intelligence dominance over Iran,\u201d said Marc Polymeropoulos, a former career CIA officer and now a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council.",
      "\u201cIf they see something emanating as a threat, they will take it out. . .That could mean military strikes. It could be covert action.\u201d",
      "Iran has already tried once to build an atomic bomb under the veil of secrecy. It had a covert nuclear weapons project more than two decades ago, according to Western intelligence agencies.",
      "But its cover was blown in December 2002, when satellite photos emerged showing an enrichment site in the city of Natanz and a heavy water plant about 200 miles away in Arak.",
      "Iran has denied it ever had a weapons program. Archival documents stolen in 2018 by Israel\u2019s Mossad spy agency, which the U.S. says are authentic, showed detailed plans to build five nuclear weapons.",
      "According to U.S. intelligence agencies, Iran abandoned its nuclear weapons project in 2003. At that point, the secrecy around the project had been breached and Iran had reason to be anxious in the wake of a U.S. invasion in neighboring Iraq.",
      "Since then, Iran maintained what it said was a civilian nuclear program. Iran\u2019s uranium enrichment and other nuclear work gave Tehran the potential option to pursue an eventual weapon if it chose to go that route \u2013 what arms control experts call a \u201cthreshold\u201d nuclear capability.",
      "Stolen blueprints",
      "If the regime chooses to race towards a bomb, it will be calculating that nuclear weapons will discourage any adversary from trying to stage an attack or topple its leadership. And it would be following a familiar path taken by other countries that successfully pursued secret bomb projects, including North Korea, Pakistan, India and Israel.",
      "The Israeli government kept the Americans in the dark about their nuclear weapons project for years.",
      "In the 1950s, French engineers helped Israel build a nuclear reactor and a secret reprocessing plant to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel. Israel\u2019s government to this day does not officially confirm or deny its nuclear arsenal, saying it will not be the first to \"introduce\" nuclear weapons in the Middle East.",
      "India\u2019s nuclear program also began in the 1950s, with the United States and Canada providing nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel for purely peaceful purposes. India agreed to safeguards designed to prevent the reactors and fuel from being used for weapons.",
      "But India secretly reprocessed spent fuel into plutonium in the 1960s, building up fissile material for a nuclear weapon. By 1974, India carried out its first nuclear test, code-named Smiling Buddha.",
      "Pakistan built its bomb with the help of nuclear scientist A.Q. Khan, a metallurgist who stole blueprints and other information on advanced centrifuges while working at a nuclear engineering firm in Amsterdam. Khan later was linked with distributing nuclear weapons technology to Iran and North Korea among others.",
      "Khan\u2019s assistance in the 1990s proved crucial for North Korea\u2019s program. The Pyongyang regime also bought technology and hardware abroad through front companies or on the black market, according to U.N. monitors.",
      "It was America that helped Iran launch its nuclear program, before the 1979 revolution that toppled the monarchy. During the Shah\u2019s rule, through the U.S. \u201cAtoms for Peace Program,\u201d the United States provided nuclear technology, fuel, training and equipment to Iran in the 1960s, including a research reactor.",
      "Now Iran likely has no need to turn to outside partners for technical know-how, experts say. Still, the regime will have a daunting task reconstituting whatever is left of its nuclear program.",
      "Every known nuclear site in Iran was targeted in Israel\u2019s air campaign earlier this month. And then last week the U.S. launched an attack on three enrichment sites using 14 \u201cbunker buster\u201d 30,000-pound bombs and more than a dozen Tomahawk missiles. The CIA says key facilities were destroyed and the nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged\u201d in the strikes.",
      "Despite the unprecedented damage, which is still being assessed, it\u2019s possible Iran may have the technical means to relaunch a weapons program \u2013 including enriched uranium, centrifuges and access to tunnels or other underground sites, some arms control experts say.",
      "Iran\u2019s entire stockpile of highly enriched uranium has yet to be accounted for, and it has an unknown number of centrifuges in storage that were not located at the sites bombed by Israel, NBC News has reported.",
      "Iran\u2019s most significant technical obstacle, however, could be producing uranium metal. Iran only had one known site where it could convert uranium into a solid metal state, and Israeli air strikes destroyed it in Isfahan.",
      "Iran would not be able to produce a nuclear weapon without such a facility, and it\u2019s unclear if the regime has a secret uranium metal product plant elsewhere.",
      "Technical hurdles aside, the decision whether to build a nuclear bomb ultimately will be shaped by political considerations rather than technology or logistics, according to Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.",
      "\u201cIt really is a political decision not a technical one,\" Lewis said. \"They still have a lot of capability left.\"",
      "After coming under a withering aerial assault that demonstrated Israel\u2019s air superiority, Iran may view nuclear weapons as the only way to defend itself and preserve the regime\u2019s survival, according to Marvin Weinbaum, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute think tank and a professor at the University of Illinois.",
      "\u201cIran has every reason now, based on what\u2019s just happened, to say we\u2019ve got to have a bomb, [and] we\u2019ll be treated differently if we do,\u201d Weinbaum said.",
      "Officials in Iran\u2019s regime have long debated whether to develop nuclear weapons, and its policy over the past two decades appeared to strike a compromise, giving Tehran the option to go nuclear if circumstances required. The question for Iranian officials is whether nuclear weapons will help ensure the regime\u2019s survival or endanger its grip on power, regional analysts said.",
      "Looming over Iran\u2019s decision is the threat of Israeli espionage and air power, potentially catching Tehran in the act of rushing to produce a bomb.",
      "\u201cIt will be interesting to see whether the regime buckles down and gets serious about it, or whether their operational security remains as terrible as ever,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cThey have been so careless.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff is due to hold talks on a possible agreement with Iran in coming days to try to halt its uranium enrichment in return for sanctions relief.",
      "Meanwhile, American and Israeli spy agencies \u201cwill be laser focused on trying to see what Iran is doing behind the scenes,\u201d Polymeropoulos said."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 Young people in China may not be buying cars or  houses, but there\u2019s always money for milk tea and toys.",
      "It\u2019s a challenging time to be a young person in China: The world\u2019s second-biggest economy is growing far slower than it was when their parents were their age, with the U.S.-China trade war threatening to further weigh on growth. Competition for jobs is cutthroat and monthly youth unemployment stands at about 15% on average, with Chinese universities churning out a record 12.22 million new graduates this year.",
      "Feeling \u201cbesieged\u201d in life in the face of these economic obstacles, young Chinese consumers at home and abroad are finding comfort in smaller purchases.",
      "\u201cI spend to make myself happy,\u201d said Kitty Lu, a 23-year-old Chinese student in Melbourne, Australia. \u201cIt sounds a bit reckless, but I do have a number in my mind.\u201d",
      "Lu said most of her spending goes toward supporting celebrities she likes. Occasionally, she allows herself a \u201csmall indulgence\u201d in the form of \u201cblind box\u201d toys such as Disney dolls or the Labubu monster figurines that have become a global frenzy.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m not that into these dolls,\u201d she said, adding that the purchase is more about having fun with friends as they open the blind box together to see which doll is inside.",
      "Lu\u2019s spending habits reflect a growing trend in recent years among young Chinese who show \u201clow interest\u201d in big purchases such as houses and cars but are embracing food and cultural products that offer \u201cinstant emotional gratification,\u201d according to the Fudan Development Institute, a Shanghai-based think tank.",
      "This phenomenon, also known as \u201cemotional consumption,\u201d has resulted in average annual growth of about 12% in industries including films and games since 2013, according to a report in March by the Chinese software and internet services company Kingsoft. The overall market for emotional consumption is projected to exceed $270 billion this year, the report said.",
      "Sweet drinks, low prices, happier life",
      "One of the biggest beneficiaries of Chinese consumer trends has been the country\u2019s beverage sector, which according to S&P Global is expected to grow up to 6% this year.",
      "Mixue, a bubble tea chain known for its cheap drinks, now has more stores worldwide \u2014 over 45,000, with nearly 10% of them outside mainland China \u2014 than any other food and beverage chain, including McDonald\u2019s, which has a global store count of 43,000, and Starbucks, with 38,000. In March, Mixue\u2019s shares jumped more than 40% on its market debut in Hong Kong.",
      "The brand\u2019s success stems largely from its low prices and rapid expansion, especially in less developed cities, as Chinese people adjust their spending habits while grappling with job security and other economic concerns.",
      "Kelsey Yu, 23, a graduate student in Beijing, said she bought a bottle of lemonade from Mixue for the equivalent of less than $1 on a visit in April to the southern Chinese city of Jieyang.",
      "\u201cThe drink quenched my thirst. It had a large portion and was cheap,\u201d she said, adding that Mixue\u2019s items are \u201cbetter value for money\u201d than those of many local competitors.",
      "Yu said that as a foodie, she drinks tea-based beverages at least once or twice a week and may \u201cindulge a bit more\u201d while traveling.",
      "\u201cI usually order milk tea when I\u2019m feeling tired or if I just want to have a good time,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I have self-control. So I won\u2019t have it every day.\u201d",
      "A complicated picture of Chinese consumption",
      "While U.S. officials often say Chinese consumers are not spending enough, the situation is not as clear-cut as it is portrayed, analysts said.",
      "In the past quarter-century, China\u2019s consumer spending has grown an average of 8% or more each year, one of the highest rates among major economies. But it has been outstripped by investment, making consumption a smaller part of China\u2019s overall GDP.",
      "Speaking at the World Economic Forum\u2019s \u201cSummer Davos\u201d event in Tianjin on Wednesday, Chinese Premier Li Qiang said China sought to become a \u201cmega-sized consumption powerhouse.\u201d",
      "Boosted by government subsidies, China\u2019s retail sales grew 6.4% in May, the fastest rate since late 2023.",
      "Sales during this year\u2019s monthlong 618 online shopping festival, which ended June 18, were a record 855.6 billion yuan ($119 billion), according to retail data provider Syntun, 15.2% higher than last year.",
      "Young Chinese in particular are \u201cliving frugally to spend big,\u201d according to state-backed research. Though they are budget-conscious when it comes to daily necessities, they \u201cdon\u2019t hesitate to splurge\u201d for their hobbies and happiness, it said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d rather spend 300 yuan ($42) on a great meal, and if the food is really good, I would think it\u2019s totally worth it,\u201d Yu said. \u201cBut if it\u2019s a 300-yuan piece of clothing, I might hesitate.\u201d",
      "Amid China\u2019s economic challenges, middle-class consumers are less brand-conscious and prefer cheaper alternatives, said Yaling Jiang, founder of ApertureChina, a consulting firm that specializes in consumer research.",
      "\u201cNow saving is seen as cool, and seeking value is seen as cool,\u201d Jiang said. \u201cI think the downturn definitely changed the culture of spending.\u201d",
      "Chinese mallgoers these days spend money almost exclusively on the first and second floors, where food and beverage shops are concentrated, Jiang said.",
      "\u201cPeople are walking around the mall with a cup of milk tea or coffee,\u201d she added, looking at what\u2019s available in stores before going home to buy cheaper alternatives online.",
      "China\u2019s luxury market, which had accounted for almost a third of global sales, declined 18% to 20% last year, according to a January report by Bain and Company.",
      "\u201cI think there is less focus on the social status comparison, and more focus on what brings them personal happiness,\u201d said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING, a post-pandemic change that has also been seen elsewhere.",

Hospital officials said 18 people were killed.",
      "The strike was the latest violence surrounding the distribution of food to Gaza\u2019s population, which has been thrown into turmoil over the past month. After blocking all food for 2 1/2 months, Israel has allowed only a trickle of supplies into the territory since mid-May.",
      "Efforts by the United Nations to distribute the food have been plagued by armed gangs looting trucks and by crowds of desperate people offloading supplies from convoys.",
      "The strike in the central town of Deir al-Balah on Thursday appeared to target members of Sahm, a security unit tasked with stopping looters and cracking down on merchants who sell stolen aid at high prices.

      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

    "summary": "A recent scientific study concluded a woman can run one mile in under 4 minutes. In the coming days, Faith Kipyegon will test that theory on the track.",
    "story": [
      "Last winter, a study startled the running world when a team of researchers concluded that, under the right circumstances, Kenyan superstar Faith Kipyegon could break a barrier long thought impossible \u2014 becoming the first woman to run 1 mile in less than four minutes.",
      "In the coming days, under a worldwide spotlight, that theory will be put to the test.",
      "Kipyegon on Thursday will line up in Paris in a Nike-sponsored race called Breaking4, just four laps \u2014 and 1,609 meters, to be exact \u2014 from history.",
      "If there were ever a runner to make such an attempt, it would be the 31-year-old Kipyegon. A three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, who holds the world record in the 1,500 meters and formerly held the record at 5,000 meters, as well, she has come closer to the four-minute barrier than anyone. In 2023, racing in Monaco, Kipyegon smashed the previous world record for the mile by running 4:07.64.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really stretching your imagination and acceptance of how women can excel in sport,\u201d said Rodger Kram, an associate professor emeritus at the University of Colorado who co-authored the study published in February in the Royal Society of Open Science.",
      "Yet speed alone won\u2019t make up the 7.64-second difference between her personal best and a barrier-breaking achievement \u2014 a lifetime in a race as short as the mile. The big variable is how exactly Kipyegon will \u201cdraft\u201d off pace-setters around her, thus reducing her aerodynamic drag. How many pacers Nike will use, and what formation they will employ, remains a mystery.",
      "Kipyegon told The Associated Press that \u201cbreaking four will really cement my legacy.\u201d Yet breaking four minutes could lead to a wider effect. Half-marathons and marathons have enjoyed a post-pandemic participation boom, but Kram wonders whether Kipyegon\u2019s example could inspire more women to run middle distances.",
      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Sitting off the Horn of Africa, the Yemeni island of Socotra was largely left to its own devices for  centuries, its few guests arriving to trade for aromatic frankincense, the healing plant aloe and the crimson sap of the dragon\u2019s blood tree, used for dyes.",
      "Roughly the size of New York\u2019s Long Island, Socotra is about 140 miles off the coast of Somalia, a remote location that has allowed a unique ecosystem to flourish. It has a rich array of bird and animal life, and the coral reefs off its shores teem with colorful marine life. One-third of its 825 plant species cannot be found anywhere else on Earth, according to UNESCO.",
      "Some, including conservationist Kay Van Damme, have called it the Gal\u00e1pagos of the Indian Ocean and along with other experts, he is warning that millions of years of evolution on Socotra could be under \u201cserious threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cClimate change is by far the biggest threat to the island\u2019s biodiversity,\u201d Van Damme, who has worked on Socotra for more than two decades, told NBC News in a call last month. \u201cIt is a relatively small island with a predominantly arid climate. Even small additional impacts from climate change can have an outsized effect, putting further pressure on fragile ecosystems.\u201d",
      "Prolonged droughts brought on by climate change are compounding damage from devastating cyclones in 2015 and 2018 that destroyed reefs, eroded soil and uprooted rare plants.",
      "The island\u2019s lifeblood, endemic species of frankincense trees, are also under threat. Four of the 11 recognized species on the island were classified as critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature in March.",
      "Five were recognized as endangered.\u201cTheir decline reflects the wider degradation of terrestrial habitats across the island and the ecosystems they support,\u201d said Van Damme, adding that overgrazing \u2014 predominantly from goats \u2014 is another significant challenge, leading to habitat degradation and \u201cleaving behind overmature trees with fewer younger trees to replace them.\u201d",
      "Tourism\u2019s growing footprint",
      "Attracted by Socotra\u2019s pristine beaches, turquoise waters and surreal flora, tourists are also placing mounting pressure on the island\u2019s fragile ecosystem.",
      "While there is only a handful of hotels, mostly in the capital Hadibo, a growing number of tour operators offer luxury camping and 4x4 tours around the island, some of which are packaged as ecotourism.",
      "Authorities have agreed to limit the number of tourists to around 4,500 per year, Ali Yahya, a local conservationist and tour operator, said in an interview last month, adding that when it came to \u201cvery sensitive areas in terms of ecosystems, biodiversity and cultural heritage, it\u2019s strictly not allowed to build any big buildings or large-scale hotels.\u201d",
      "But despite Socotra\u2019s UNESCO World Heritage designation \u2014 requiring preservation under international agreements \u2014 violations occur frequently, another local guide, Abdulraoof al-Gamhi, said in a series of voice and written messages last month.",
      "\u201cSome tourists build fires under dragon blood trees, carve inscriptions into rare trees, leave trash behind them and scare birds with their drones,\u201d he said. But he added that many of the island\u2019s residents benefit from tourism and that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for \u201ctour companies, car owners, drivers, restaurants, hotels and sellers of handcrafts.\u201d",
      "Echoing his concerns, Van Damme also said endangered species were \u201cbeing killed just for a selfie,\u201d with rare species like chameleons being captured so tourists can take pictures with them.",
      "Al-Gamhi also said he expected the number of tourists to rise as more people discover the unique locale, and \u201cthat will put a lot of pressure on our environment.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a big challenge,\u201d he added.",
      "A cautionary tale",
      "Although the Gal\u00e1pagos comparison is often used to celebrate Socotra\u2019s biodiversity, it can also serve as a warning, according to Van Damme, who co-authored a 2011 study on human impacts on the island.",
      "Since the 19th century, the Gal\u00e1pagos, remote islands some 600 miles off the coast of mainland Ecuador known for their unique flora and fauna, have lost numerous endemic species to habitat disruption, overtourism and invasive species.",
      "\u201cPerhaps Socotran ecosystems,\u201d Van Damme wrote at the time, \u201ccould now be considered as having at least, a similar state of health of those in the Gal\u00e1pagos at the time of [the Ecuadorian islands\u2019] nomination as world heritage site 30 years ago.\u201d He added that Socotra risked a similar fate without \u201ctimely conservation efforts.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we consider the present-day condition in the Gal\u00e1pagos, we might catch a glimpse of Socotra\u2019s future, or better, what could happen if trends and threats continue in parallel,\u201d the paper added.",
      "That assessment \u201cturned out to be very predictive,\u201d particularly in terms of climate change, he told NBC News.",
      "The Gal\u00e1pagos Islands now host over 250,000 annual visitors, under strict controls including visitor caps, mandatory guides, designated trails and substantial tourism fees, which fund conservation.",
      "Socotra needs to implement similar protections before damage becomes irreversible, Van Damme said.",
      "Culture and tradition",
      "Beyond the environment, there are signs that tourism is also eroding the island\u2019s social fabric, according to Yahya, who said there was already a \u201ccultural shift\u201d among its 60,000 residents, many of whom remain deeply traditional and speak Soqotri, an ancient, unwritten language with pre-Islamic roots.",
      "\u201cInternational behaviors are influencing locals, and we worry about the erosion of our traditions,\u201d he said, adding that while tourists were welcome, some of them needed to be more respectful.",
      "An Instagram picture of a woman posing in a bikini beneath a dragon\u2019s blood tree had upset residents of one mountain village, he said, adding that it was seen as highly disrespectful by the conservative residents.",
      "Despite the pressures, there are reasons to be positive, Van Damme said, noting that authorities on the island are open to collaboration and local conservation projects are gaining traction.",
      "\u201cCommunity-led and other ongoing initiatives are vital,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as they continue, there\u2019s genuine hope for the island\u2019s future.\u201d"

Aid workers say the war spiked market prices, limited aid delivery, and shrunk agricultural lands in a country that was once a breadbasket of the world.",
      "Sudan plunged into war in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary the Rapid Support Forces escalated to fighting in the capital Khartoum and spread across the country, killing over 20,000 people, displacing nearly 13 million people, and pushing many to the brink of famine in what aid workers deemed the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis.",

A physical cash shortage prompted the Norwegian Refugee Council to replace cash assistance with vouchers. Meanwhile, authorities monopolize some markets and essential foods such as corn, wheat flour, sugar and salt are only sold through security approvals, according to Hassan.",
      "Meanwhile, in southwest Sudan, residents of Nyala, the capital of South Darfur, rely on growing crops, but agricultural lands are shrinking due to fighting and lack of farming resources.",
      "Hawaa Hussein, a woman who has been displaced in El Serif camp since 2004, told the AP that they benefit from the rainy season but they\u2019re lacking essential farming resources such as seeds and tractors to grow beans, peanuts, sesame, wheat, and weika \u2014 dried powdered okra.",
      "Hussein, a grandmother living with eight family members, said her family receives a food parcel every two months, containing lentils, salt, oil, and biscuits. Sometimes she buys items from the market with the help of community leaders.",
      "\u201cThere are many families in the camp, mine alone has five children, and so aid is not enough for everyone \u2026 you also can\u2019t eat while your neighbor is hungry and in need,\u201d she said.",
      "El Serif camp is sheltering nearly 49,000 displaced people, the camp\u2019s civic leader Abdalrahman Idris told the AP. Since the war began in 2023, the camp has taken in over 5,000 new arrivals, with a recent surge coming from the greater Khartoum region, which is the Sudanese military said it took full control of in May.",
      "\u201cThe food that reaches the camp makes up only 5% of the total need. Some people need jobs and income. People now only eat two meals, and some people can\u2019t feed their children,\u201d he said.",
      "In North Darfur, south of El Fasher, lies Zamzam camp, one of the worst areas struck by famine and recent escalating violence. An aid worker with the Emergency Response Rooms previously based in the camp who asked not to be identified in fear of retribution for speaking with the press, told the AP that the recent wave of violence killed some and left others homeless.",
      "Barely anyone was able to afford food from the market as a pound of sugar costs 20,000 Sudanese pounds ($33) and a soap bar 10,000 Sudanese pounds ($17).",
      "The recent attacks in Zamzam worsened the humanitarian situation and he had to flee to a safer area. Some elderly men, pregnant women, and children have died of starvation and the lack of medical treatment, according to an aid worker, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he\u2019s fearful of retribution for speaking publicly while living in an area controlled by one of the warring parties. He didn\u2019t provide the exact number of those deaths.",
      "He said the situation in Zamzam camp is dire\u2014\u201cas if people were on death row.\u201d",
      "Yet A.H. finished his poem with hope:",
      "\u201cWhen people clashed and death filled the city squares\u201d A.H. wrote \u201cyou, Koro, were a symbol of life and a title of loyalty.\u201d"

      "Noem, who shortened the duration of Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for some 521,000 Haitians earlier this year, will terminate the status on September 2, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said.",
      "President Donald Trump, a Republican, has sought to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration during the first four months of his presidency. Noem, who shares Trump\u2019s hardline stance, moved in February to end TPS for some 350,000 Venezuelans, as well as thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon.",

    "summary": "The majority of the Constitutional Court's justices found the government violated the migrants' rights by not giving them access to counsel or enough information about their status.",
    "story": [
      "Costa Rica\u2019s Constitutional Court on Tuesday ordered the government of Rodrigo Chaves to release Asian migrants deported by the Trump administration who have been held in a temporary shelter in the Central American country since February.",
      "In a 4-3 vote, the justices found that the Costa Rican government had violated the migrants\u2019 rights by failing to provide them with \u201ctimely and sufficient information\u201d about their immigration status or give them access to legal counsel. \u201cNor was free contact with the media permitted, nor was there any information from the outset about the possibility of requesting asylum,\u201d the court said in a statement.",
      "The judges gave the government 15 days to release the deported migrants and ordered it to determine their immigration status \u201cindividually\u201d and based on the law.",
      "In February, the Trump administration sent 200 Asian migrants to Costa Rica on two deportation flights, including nearly 100 children. The deportees came from countries such as China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Russia and Uzbekistan. More than 70 were minors.",
      "The agreement between the two countries was reached as Costa Rica feared that President Donald Trump would retaliate if it refused to accept the migrants, according to statements made to the press by the president and the foreign minister.",
      "The deportees were immediately taken to the Temporary Migrant Care Center (CATEM), in the canton of Corredores, 7 miles from the border with Panama. They slept cramped in shared, poorly ventilated bunks in a hot, humid region where temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "As of Tuesday, 28 people remained deported, including 13 minors, from Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran, Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "The vast majority of the deportees, 107, were repatriated to their countries of origin. Another 35 left the center on their own, and 30 requested asylum in Costa Rica, Badilla said.",
      "Costa Rican authorities described the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling as a \u201cserious error\u201d and asserted that the migrants still there \u201cenjoy complete freedom; they can leave and move freely,\u201d according to Badilla.",
      "\u201c(The constitutional ruling) makes no sense. For months, these people have had regular immigration status and complete freedom of movement,\u201d the official said.",
      "\"From our perspective, the Constitutional Court is mistaken and making a serious error. It clearly doesn\u2019t understand the current situation at CATEM,\u201d he added.",
      "The constitutional ruling responds to a habeas corpus petition against the Costa Rican government filed by the country\u2019s former minister of communications, Mauricio Herrera.",
      "In late April, Costa Rica granted humanitarian immigration status to the migrants held at the shelter after a group of human rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against the country before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, alleging that the government had violated the rights of 81 migrant minors by detaining them at the shelter without legal counsel or access to education or psychological services.",
      "At the time, Costa Rican authorities announced that the migrants, whose passports were confiscated upon arrival in the country, would receive their documents back and were free to leave the shelter and seek options to leave Costa Rica or seek asylum if they so desired.",
      "In April, Noticias Telemundo visited CATEM and spoke with some of the migrants, including a 36-year-old Russian, German Smirnov, who was deported with his wife and 6-year-old son. Smirnov, originally from St. Petersburg, said he had worked in his country as an electoral official and witnessed how elections were manipulated in Russia. He said he sought out the organization of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a Siberian prison in 2024, to report fraud in the 2024 elections, but authorities under Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime discovered him.",
      "\"They\u2019ll put me in jail or send me to war\" if he returns to Russia, Smirnov said. \"It\u2019s simple, because my country is at war with a neighboring country.\u201d",
      "Help the powerful brother of the north",
      "In announcing the agreement with the United States, Chaves said  Costa Rica was helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother to the north\u201d and indicated that it feared punishment if it did not accept the migrants.",
      "\u201cIf they impose a tax on our free trade zones, they\u2019ll screw us,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, thank God. ... Love is repaid with love. ... Two hundred come, we treat them well and they leave,\" he said at a news conference.",
      "Costa Rican Foreign Minister Arnoldo Andr\u00e9 Tinoco also expressed the country\u2019s fear of Trump\u2019s \u201cpressure,\u201d although he denied that it had materialized.",
      "What Chavez meant, Andr\u00e9 said in an interview with Noticias Telemundo in late March, \"was that, through a gesture of goodwill, we would somewhat alleviate the pressure if the United States were thinking of imposing some kind of restriction that doesn\u2019t interest us. Of course, we\u2019re not interested.\"",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no pressure. Possibility? Of course it exists. Yes. Look at what the new U.S. administration is doing around the world. ... You\u2019re not going to get me to say that I was pressured by the United States because that\u2019s not true,\u201d he asserted.",
