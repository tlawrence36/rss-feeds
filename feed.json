      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way.

      "The U.S. has taken the unprecedented step of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups say would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases",
      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of cutting the number of vaccines it recommends for every child \u2014 a move that leading medical groups said would undermine protections against a half-dozen diseases.",
      "The change is effective immediately, meaning that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend that all children get vaccinated against 11 diseases. What's no longer broadly recommended is protection against flu, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high risk, or when doctors recommend them in what's called \u201cshared decision-making.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won't result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the decision creates confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.",
      "States, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "The change comes as U.S. vaccination rates have been slipping and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "\u201cThis decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,\u201d Kennedy said in a statement Monday.",
      "Trump, reacting to the news on his Truth Social platform, said the new schedule is \u201cfar more reasonable\u201d and \u201cfinally aligns the United States with other Developed Nations around the World.\u201d",
      "Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are vaccines against measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and human papillomavirus, or HPV. The guidance reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against HPV from two or three shots depending on age to one for most children.",
      "Medical experts said Monday's changes without what they said was public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.",
      "\u201cAbandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\u201d said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t just copy and paste public health and that\u2019s what they seem to be doing here,\u201d said O\u2019Leary. \u201cLiterally children's health and children's lives are at stake.\u201d",
      "Most high-income countries recommend vaccinations against a dozen to 15 serious pathogens, according to a recent review by the Vaccine Integrity Project, a group that works to safeguard vaccine use.",

      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own childhood vaccine schedule that its members are following, and it continues to broadly recommend vaccines that the Trump administration demoted.",
      "O'Leary singled out the flu vaccine, which the government and leading medical experts have long urged for nearly everyone starting at age 6 months. He said the government is \u201cpretty tone deaf\u201d for ending its recommendation while the country is at the beginning of a severe flu season, and after 280 children died from flu last winter, the most since 2009.",
      "Even a disease that parents may not have heard of, rotavirus, could come roaring back if vaccination erodes, he added. That diarrheal disease once hospitalized thousands of children each winter, something that no longer happens.",
      "The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.",
      "The officials added that the new recommendations were a collaborative effort between federal health agencies but wouldn\u2019t specify who was consulted.",
      "Scientists at the CDC\u2019s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases were asked to present to the agency\u2019s political leadership about vaccine schedules in other countries in December, but they were not allowed to give any recommendations and were not aware of any decisions about vaccine schedule changes, said Abby Tighe, executive director of the National Public Health Coalition, an advocacy organization of current and former CDC employees and their supporters.",
      "\u201cChanges of this magnitude require careful review, expert and public input, and clear scientific justification. That level of rigor and transparency was not part of this decision,\u201d said Dr. Sandra Fryhofer, of the American Medical Association. \u201cThe scientific evidence remains unchanged, and the AMA supports continued access to childhood immunizations recommended by national medical specialty societies.\u201d",
      "The move comes as Kennedy, a longtime activist against vaccines, has repeatedly used his authority in government to translate his skepticism about the shots into national guidance.",
      "In May, Kennedy announced the CDC would no longer recommend COVID-19 vaccines for healthy children and pregnant women \u2014 a move immediately questioned by public health experts who saw no new data to justify the change.",
      "In June, Kennedy fired an entire 17-member CDC vaccine advisory committee \u2014 later installing several of his own replacements, including multiple vaccine skeptics.",
      "Kennedy in November also personally directed the CDC to abandon its position that vaccines do not cause autism, without supplying any new evidence to support the change.",

      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",

      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "The complaint, filed Thursday on the employees\u2019 behalf by the Human Rights Campaign, is in response to an August announcement from the Office of Personnel Management that it would no longer cover \u201cchemical and surgical modification of an individual\u2019s sex traits through medical interventions\u201d in health insurance programs for federal employees and U.S. Postal Service workers.",
      "The complaint argues that denying coverage of gender-affirming care is sex-based discrimination and asks the personnel office to rescind the policy.",
      "\u201cThis policy is not about cost or care \u2014 it is about driving transgender people and people with transgender spouses, children, and dependents out of the federal workforce,\u201d Human Rights Campaign Foundation President Kelley Robinson said in a statement announcing the move.",

      "Pakistan\u2019s latest figures highlight both momentum and lingering risks in a campaign that has spanned decades. While vaccination coverage has improved and reported cases have fallen sharply, health officials say continued transmission in a small number of hard-to-reach areas means the country remains vulnerable to setbacks unless immunization efforts are sustained.",
      "Haq said Pakistan will launch its first anti-polio drive of the new year in the first week of February. He said no new infections have been reported anywhere in the country since September, attributing the decline to vaccination drives carried out during the year.",

      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Tuesday closed out the Vatican\u2019s 2025 Holy Year by denouncing today's consumerist and anti-foreigner sentiment, capping a Jubilee that saw some 33 million pilgrims flock to Rome and a historic transition from one American pontiff to another.",
      "With cardinals and diplomats looking on, Leo kneeled down in prayer on the stone floor at the threshold of the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica. He then stood up and pulled the two doors shut, symbolically concluding the rarest of Jubilees: one that was opened by a feeble Pope Francis in December 2024, continued during his funeral and the conclave, and then was closed by Francis' successor a year later.",
      "Only once before, in 1700, has a Holy Year been opened by one pope and closed by another.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony, at the start of Mass celebrating the feast of Epiphany, capped a dizzying year of special audiences, Masses and meetings that dominated Leo\u2019s first months as pontiff and in many ways put his own agenda on hold.",
      "As if to signal his pontificate now can begin in earnest, Leo has summoned the world\u2019s cardinals to the Vatican for two days of meetings starting Wednesday to discuss governing the 1.4-billion strong Catholic Church. On the agenda is the issue of the liturgy, suggesting Leo is diving head-first into the divisions within the church over the celebration of the old Latin Mass.",
      "In his homily Tuesday, Leo said the Jubilee year had invited all Christians to reflect on the Biblical teachings to welcome the stranger and resist \u201cthe flattery and seduction of those in power.\u201d",
      "\u201cAround us, a distorted economy tries to profit from everything,\u201d he said. \u201cLet us ask ourselves: has the Jubilee taught us to flee from this type of efficiency that reduces everything to a product and human beings to consumers? After this year, will we be better able to recognize a pilgrim in the visitor, a seeker in the stranger, a neighbor in the foreigner, and fellow travelers in those who are different?\u201d",
      "He echoed the theme in a special Epiphany prayer delivered from the basilica loggia to a rain-soaked piazza below. As thousands of people huddled under colorful umbrellas and ponchos, Leo recalled that traditionally Jubilees have included appeals for peace and \u201ca redistribution of the land and its resources\u201d to those in need.",
      "\u201cIn the place of inequality, may there be fairness, and may the industry of war be replaced by the craft of peace,\u201d he said.",
      "For the Vatican, a Holy Year is a centuries-old tradition of the faithful making pilgrimages to Rome every 25 years to visit the tombs of Saints Peter and Paul and receive indulgences for the forgiveness of their sins if they pass through the Holy Door.",
      "For Rome, it\u2019s a chance to take advantage of public funds, in this case some 4 billion euros ($4.3 billion), to carry out long-delayed projects to lift the city out of years of neglect and bring it up to modern, European standards.",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",
      "\u201cThat is frightening,\u201d said Munodawafa. \u201cFor such a small population, those numbers are alarming.\u201d",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",

      "The dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas to capture leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife early Saturday left the world stunned, and heightened concerns in Denmark and Greenland, which is a semiautonomous territory of the Danish kingdom and thus part of NATO.",
      "Frederiksen and her Greenlandic counterpart, Jens Frederik Nielsen, blasted the president's comments and warned of catastrophic consequences. Numerous European leaders expressed solidarity with them.",
      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday. \u201cThat is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.\u201d",
      "Trump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the island. His comments Sunday, including telling reporters \u201clet\u2019s talk about Greenland in 20 days,\u201d further deepened fears that the U.S. was planning an intervention in Greenland in the near future.",
      "Frederiksen also said Trump \u201cshould be taken seriously\u201d when he says he wants Greenland. \u201cWe will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,\u201d she added.",
      "Nielsen, in a news conference Monday, said Greenland cannot be compared to Venezuela. He urged his constituents to stay calm and united.",
      "\u201cWe are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation,\u201d he said.",
      "Nielsen added: \u201cThe situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland.\u201d",
      "Ask Rostrup, a TV2 political journalist, wrote on the station's live blog Monday that Mette previously would have flatly rejected the idea of an American takeover of Greenland. But now, Rostrup wrote, the rhetoric has escalated so much that she has to acknowledge the possibility.",
      "Trump on Sunday also mocked Denmark\u2019s efforts at boosting Greenland\u2019s national security posture, saying the Danes have added \u201cone more dog sled\u201d to the Arctic territory\u2019s arsenal.",

      "President Donald Trump has again raised the idea of acting against Mexican drug cartels, but Mexico and analysts doubt unilateral U.S. military action",
      "MEXICO CITY -- After the United States military intervention in Venezuela, the Mexican government and analysts discounted the likelihood of unilateral U.S. military action against Mexican drug cartels, despite threats from President Donald Trump.",
      "Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum\u2019s administration has been complying with Washington's demands and the economic ties between the two countries are vital, they say.",
      "Nonetheless, many expect more such threats as a way to extract more concessions from Mexico. No one dares rule out completely an unexpected move by the U.S. president.",
      "Sheinbaum downplayed the possibility of U.S. military action Monday. \u201cI don\u2019t see risks (of that),\u201d she said. \u201cThere is coordination, there is collaboration with the United States government.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t believe in (the possibility of) invasion, I don\u2019t believe even that it\u2019s something they are taking seriously,\u201d she said. \u201cOrganized crime is not taken care with (foreign military) intervention.\u201d",
      "Here are some of the reasons:",
      "Mexico has a radically different situation from that of Venezuela or other countries Washington is eying, like Cuba. First, Sheinbaum is a popular and legitimately elected president. Second, Mexico is the main commercial partner of the United States, a country where 40 million Mexicans live. Third, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio \u201chas recognized that there is high-level cooperation with Mexico,\u201d said Martha B\u00e1rcena, former Mexican ambassador to the United States.",
      "Trump and his collaborators have flirted with the idea of invading or attacking the cartels in Mexico since his election campaign, but in increasingly measured tones.",
      "Sheinbaum has confirmed that the idea of U.S. military intervention in Mexico has been brought up repeatedly in her conversations with Trump, but said she has always rejected the offer. She sees it has a non-starter and insists that her relationship with Trump is one of mutual respect.",
      "The threat though, similar to those about tariffs on Mexican imports \u2014 some carried out and others not \u2014 have been a \u201cnegotiation weapon\u201d to get \u201ccommercial, diplomatic and political advantages,\u201d said Mexican security analyst David Saucedo. Rubio and Trump \"play good cop, bad cop,\u201d with Trump threatening and Rubio smoothing over, he said.",
      "Mexico is doing almost everything that Washington has requested since Trump began imposing tariffs, experts say. Sheinbaum\u2019s administration became more aggressive toward the cartels than her predecessor. There have been more arrests, drug seizures and extraditions. Mexico has agreed to receive more deportees from other countries.",

      "\u201cIntervention, military action in Mexico would suspend that cooperation,\u201d said Carlos P\u00e9rez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico\u2019s Center for Economic Research and Teaching (CIDE). That would be a great risk to the U.S. because it would be left without a partner to work with, he added.",
      "Saucedo said that U.S. military action in Mexico would require money, logistics and risks, while \u201ca comment, a post on social networks doesn\u2019t cost anything\u201d and has been very effective.",
      "Analysts believe the threats will continue to be the Trump administration\u2019s negotiation style, especially this year when the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement (USMCA) is up for revision.",
      "Saucedo said Trump could demand more access for U.S. security agencies, even if operations are presented publicly as coordinated and carried out by Mexico. He could also pressure Mexico for more high-profile captures or to stop exporting oil to Cuba, or threaten new tariffs.",
      "\u201cWith the ongoing negotiations over punitive tariffs, the statutory revision of the USMCA and the delicate antidrug cooperation agenda, the Mexican government will have to be very meticulous in its position and statements,\u201d Arturo Sarukh\u00e1n, another former Mexican ambassador to the U.S. said. Rallying around Maduro \u201cwould cost Mexico dearly,\u201d as could Mexico\u2019s ongoing support of Cuba.",
      "B\u00e1rcena, the diplomat, said that what Mexico still needs to address is political corruption tied to organized crime while still defending international law.",

      "Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam were arrested five years ago under India\u2019s harsh state security law and accused of conspiring to incite the communal violence that swept parts of Delhi in February 2020. The riots left 53 people dead, most of them Muslims, and took place amid massive months-long protests against a controversial 2019 citizenship law that critics said discriminated against Muslims.",
      "While bail was granted to the other five accused in the same case, the court noted that Khalid and Imam had a \u201ccentral role in the conspiracy.\" It also said that the delay in their trial was not a sufficient ground for granting them bail.",

Their detention has been widely seen as emblematic of a broader crackdown on dissent under Modi, drawing criticism from rights groups over the use of anti-terror laws against activists and student leaders.",

      "In media interviews, Ahn couldn\u2019t choose what his favorite movie was, but said that his role in \u201cRadio Star\u201d as a dedicated, hardworking manger for a washed-up rock singer played by Park Jung-hoon resembled himself in real life the most.",
      "Ahn was also known for his reluctance to do love scenes. He said said he was too shy to act romantic scenes and sometimes asked directors to skip steamy scenes if they were only meant to add spice to movies.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t do well on acting like looking at someone who I don\u2019t love with loving eyes and kissing really romantically. I feel shy and can\u2019t express such emotions well,\u201d Ahn said in an interview with the Shindonga magazine in 2007. \u201cSimply, I\u2019m clumsy on that. So I couldn\u2019t star in such movies a lot. But ultimately, that was a right choice for me.\u201d",
      "Ahn is survived by his wife and their two sons. A mourning station at a Seoul hospital was to run until Friday.",

    "story": [
      "News organizations got a rare \u201cthank you\u201d from the Trump administration for not putting its military action in Venezuela in jeopardy by reporting on it before it happened",
      "In the wake of last weekend's U.S. military action in Venezuela, the news media got something it has seldom heard from the Trump administration: a \u201cthank you.\u201d",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited news organizations that had learned in advance about last Saturday's strike that led to the capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro with not putting the mission in jeopardy by publicly reporting on it before it happened.",
      "Rubio's acknowledgment was particularly noteworthy because Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has cited a mistrust of journalists' ability to responsibly handle sensitive information as one of the chief reasons for imposing restrictive new press rules on Pentagon reporters. Most mainstream news organizations have left posts in the Pentagon rather than agree to Hegseth's policy.",
      "Speaking on ABC's \u201cThis Week\u201d on Sunday, Rubio said the administration withheld information about the mission from Congress ahead of time because \u201cit will leak. It's as simple as that.\u201d But the primary reason was operational security, he said.",
      "\u201cFrankly, a number of media outlets had gotten leaks that this was coming and held it for that very reason,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd we thank them for doing that or lives could have been lost. American lives.\u201d",
      "Semafor, citing \u201cpeople familiar with communications between the administration and news organizations,\u201d reported that The New York Times and The Washington Post had both learned of the raid in advance but held off reporting on it to avoid endangering U.S. military personnel. Representatives for both outlets declined comment to The Associated Press on Monday.",
      "Withholding information on a planned mission for that reason is routine for news organizations, said Dana Priest, a longtime national security reporter at the Post who now teaches at the University of Maryland. Even after the fact, the Post has asked government authorities about whether revealing certain details could endanger people, she said.",
      "When The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently included in a text chain last spring where Hegseth revealed information about a military attack in Yemen, the journalist did not report on the events until well after U.S. personnel was out of danger and the information had been thoroughly checked out.",
      "Most Americans learned of the Venezuela attack in the predawn hours of Saturday when President Donald Trump announced it on his Truth Social platform upon completion.",
      "While The Associated Press did not have advance word that the operation would happen, its journalists in Venezuela heard and observed explosions taking place there, and that was reported on the news wire more than two hours before Trump's announcement. The U.S. involvement was not made clear until Trump's post, however.",
      "Hegseth, in defending rules that restrict reporters' movements and reporting in the Pentagon, told Fox News last year that \u201cwe have expectations that you're not soliciting classified or sensitive information.\u201d The Times last month filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the rules.",

      "Decisions on whether to report information that could put lives or a mission in danger often involve high-level discussions between editors and government officials. But Priest stressed that in a country with freedom of the press, the ultimate decision on whether to report the information lies with the news organization.",
      "Generations ago, President John F. Kennedy persuaded editors at the Times not to report when it learned in advance of a U.S.-backed attack by Cuban exiles on Fidel Castro\u2019s forces at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba. The mission proved a monumental failure and a Times editor, Bill Keller, later said that Kennedy expressed regret that the newspaper had not reported on what it had known because it could have prevented a fiasco.",
      "Many mainstream journalists covering the military and national security have extensive experience dealing with sensitive issues, Priest said. But there's a difference, she said, between reporting information that could put someone in danger and that which could prove embarrassing to an administration.",
      "\u201cThe reporters are not going to be deterred by a ridiculously broad censorship edict by the Trump administration,\u201d Priest said. \u201cThey're going to dig in and work even harder. Their mission is not to curry favor with the Trump administration. It's to report information to the public.\u201d",

      "Pipeline safety regulators on Monday assessed their largest fine ever against the company responsible for leaking 1.1 million gallons of oil into the Gulf off the coast of Louisiana in 2023. But the $9.6 million fine isn\u2019t likely to be a major burden for Third Coast to pay.",
      "This single fine is close to the normal total of $8 million to $10 million in all fines that the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration hands out each year. But Third Coast has a stake in some 1,900 miles of pipelines, and in September, the Houston-based company announced that it had secured a nearly $1 billion loan.",
      "Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said this spill \u201cresulted from a company-wide systemic failure, indicating the operator\u2019s fundamental inability to implement pipeline safety regulations,\u201d so the record fine is appropriate and welcome.",
      "\u201cHowever, even record fines often fail to be financially meaningful to pipeline operators. The proposed fine represents less than 3% of Third Coast Midstream\u2019s estimated annual earnings,\u201d Caram said. \u201cTrue deterrence requires penalties that make noncompliance more expensive than compliance.\u201d",
      "The agency said Third Coast didn't establish proper emergency procedures, which is part of why the National Transportation Safety Board found that operators failed to shut down the pipeline for nearly 13 hours after their gauges first hinted at a problem. PHMSA also said the company didn't adequately assess the risks or properly maintain the 18-inch Main Pass Oil Gathering pipeline.",

Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines.\u201d",
      "The NTSB said the leak off the coast of Louisiana was the result of underwater landslides, caused by hazards such as hurricanes, that Third Coast, the pipeline owner, failed to address despite the threats being well known in the industry.",
      "A Third Coast spokesperson said the company has been working to address regulators' concerns about the leak, so it was taken aback by some of the details the agency included in its allegations and the size of the fine.",
      "\u201cAfter constructive engagement with PHMSA over the last two years, we were surprised to see aspects of the recent allegations that we believe are inaccurate and exceed established precedent. We will address these concerns with the agency moving forward,\" the company spokesperson said.",

    "story": [
      "Once known for its rice fields and folk songs, Bac Ninh has become one of Vietnam\u2019s busiest factory zones",
      "BAC NINH, Vietnam -- The transformation of Vietnam's Bac Ninh is evident in the signs above its shops and the spicy Chinese and Korean dishes on its tables.",
      "Once known for its rice fields and the love duets of its centuries-old Quan Ho folk songs, the city just north of Hanoi has become one of Vietnam's busiest factory zones, reflecting a surge of investment, hastened by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes, that are reshaping the region.",
      "The economy has profited from friction between Washington and Beijing as factories shifted out of China, joining earlier waves of foreign investment by the Japanese and South Koreans that have made Vietnam a global manufacturing hub. But rising labor costs, worker shortages and inadequate infrastructure are exposing the limits to its rapid rise.",
      "With rivals like Indonesia and the Philippines competing hard for new projects, Vietnam is trying to climb into higher-value manufacturing and expand export markets to maintain that momentum. That effort is evident in Bac Ninh.",
      "Traditionally a center for artisans, Bac Ninh\u2019s first boom began around 2008 when Samsung built its first phone factory there, turning Vietnam into its largest offshore manufacturing base.",
      "Now, Chinese companies are pouring in as they diversify their factory locations to skirt U.S. tariffs and other trade restrictions. After Hanoi and Beijing normalized ties in the 1990s, inflows of Chinese investment began to pick up as Chinese firms in places like Bac Ninh tapped Vietnam\u2019s electronics supply chain, labor force and supportive local governments, often aided by Chinese-speaking intermediaries who smooth paperwork and logistics.",
      "But Vietnam is too small to replace China, whose economy is 40 times larger, as the world's factory floor. To try to keep up, its leaders are building new infrastructure, including a highway to the Chinese border that has cut travel time by more than an hour. A railway will connect Hanoi to Haiphong \u2014 Vietnam\u2019s largest seaport \u2014 and then the border town of Lao Cai.",
      "On Dec. 19, Bac Ninh broke ground on the expansion of an industrial zone for high-tech manufacturing, including electronics, pharmaceuticals and clean energy. It's part of a synchronized nationwide push in which Vietnam launched 234 major projects worth more than $129 billion just weeks before a pivotal National Party Congress in January, when leaders will decide the country\u2019s political leadership and economic direction.",
      "In Bac Ninh's downtown, a convenience store bears the name Tmall, after Alibaba\u2019s flagship online marketplace. Signs in Chinese advertise services for investors. Chinese\u2013Vietnamese language schools have opened to help locals and Chinese to learn each others' languages.",
      "But as Chinese companies compete for the best labor and other resources, costs are rising for the \u201cChina plus one\u201d strategy of moving factories out of China to other locations, for example, Apple's shift into India.",
      "\u201cIt is becoming difficult to recruit workers,\u201d said Peng, who works at a telecoms equipment company that moved from China\u2019s southern technology hub of Shenzhen. He gave only one name because he was not authorized to speak to the media.",
      "Labor costs have jumped 10%\u201315% since 2024, he said, \"And we expect them to keep rising.\u201d",
      "Vietnam still need technology, equipment and expertise from China, which had created \"the best manufacturing ecosystem,\" said Jacob Rothman, co-founder and CEO of China-based Velong Enterprises, which makes grill tools and kitchen gadgets and has shifted some production to Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam.",
      "Supply chains and manufacturers in China have benefited from decades of government support, large-scale investment and its huge population, Rothman said. \u201cYou can\u2019t recreate that overnight.\u201d",
      "Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at U.S.-based SEKO Logistics, said while factories making footwear, furniture and technology are still relocating to Vietnam, it lags China in infrastructure and logistics capabilities.",
      "Some of those limits are surfacing in boomtowns like Bac Ninh, where firms are trying to lure workers with higher wages and bonuses, a box of instant noodles on their first day and bus fares if they commute from another city, according to state media.",

      "Few countries have benefitted more from Trump's trade war than Vietnam, whose biggest export market is still the U.S. In 2024, Vietnam ran a $123.5 billion surplus with the U.S., the third largest behind China and Mexico. That irked Trump, who threatened a 46% import tax on Vietnamese goods before settling on 20%.",
      "The two countries are still working toward a deal to keep most tariffs at 20%. Vietnam has offered broad preferential access for U.S. products, the White House said in October. So far, it has largely absorbed the tariffs, running a trade surplus of $121.6 billion in January-November 2025.",
      "The agreement in October by Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping to a year-long trade truce and lower average tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. to about 47% helped ease some concerns. But persisting uncertainty over tariffs and other trade restrictions means companies aren\u2019t just trying to shift factories out of China but to spread them across several countries, said Frederic Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC.",
      "Even with lower U.S. tariffs on China, the calculus still favors moving to Southeast Asia where manufacturing inefficiencies add only about 10% in cost. But while large corporations can shift production easily, smaller firms may struggle to fit a new factory with expensive equipment.",
      "\u201c(The) race to move outside of China is still happening, and it's accelerating,\u201d Rothman said.",
      "Vietnam is still attracting ample foreign investment. Cumulative foreign investment topped $28.5 billion as of September, up 15% from last year. But scrutiny of Vietnam's role as a hub for tariff-dodging transshipments has some manufacturers hedging their bets.",
      "One of SEKO Logistics' customers has shifted some of its furniture making to India, not wanting to \u201cput all their eggs in Vietnam,\u201d Bourke said.",
      "Countries like Indonesia and the Philippines, which missed the early gains Vietnam captured, are promoting themselves as alternative manufacturing bases. In the Philippines, a new law allows foreign investors to lease private land for up to 99 years to attract long-term commercial and industrial investment.",
      "Vietnam has a goal of becoming rich by 2045. It aims to become Asia's next \u201ctiger economy,\u201d following export powerhouses like South Korea and Taiwan by shifting from low-cost assembly work to manufacture higher-value products like electronics and clean energy equipment.",
      "It's offering incentives like tax breaks on imported machinery and discounted rents to help factory suppliers upgrade and modernize. About a third still use non-automated equipment and only about 10% use robots on their production lines.",
      "The country also is trying to reduce its dependence on the U.S. market by expanding exports to the Middle East, Latin America, Africa and India. Overseas trade offices have been asked to share market intelligence and promote products made in Vietnam.",
      "Vietnam knows that rising costs and tougher competition will test how far it \u2014 and places like Bac Ninh \u2014 can climb. Announcing hundreds of projects in December, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh framed the stakes: Vietnam must \u201creach far into the ocean, delve deep underground and soar high into space.\u201d",

      "Zimbabwe\u2019s driving lessons have shifted from test prep to survival",
      "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Tafara Muvhevhi, a Zimbabwean driving instructor, began work 16 years ago, his job was simple: teach the highway code and prepare learners to ace their driving test.",
      "Today, his priorities have changed. His main concern is no longer just the exam, but whether his students will survive some of the world\u2019s deadliest roads. This is vital in a country where road crashes rank among the top killers, according to the national statistics agency, and road accident fatality rates are among the continent's worst. In Zimbabwe, a crash hits every 15 minutes and five die and 38 are injured each day, according to the country's traffic safety agency.",
      "\u201cBack then we were teaching by the book, it was all by the book,\u201d Muvhevhi said while coaching his latest student through parallel parking and smooth reversing into spaces marked by blue drums on a dusty and worn-out tarmac training ground on the outskirts of the capital, Harare.",
      "Once known for orderly traffic and well-kept roads, Zimbabwe's road safety steadily has deteriorated since the 2000s, degenerating into traffic chaos in the 2010s as economic decline gutted road maintenance, informal public transport boomed and enforcement weakened. Despite renewed repairs and policing efforts, dangerous driving remains deeply entrenched.",
      "\"The other drivers are no longer patient with us, they hoot, they overtake illegally, putting pressure on the students so our students are basically trying to adjust,\u201d he said, before his student navigated through streets where both drivers and pedestrians have little regard for rules.",
      "For the student, 19-year-old Winfrida Chipashu, a university accounting major, the roads of Harare are more intimidating than balancing ledgers.",
      "\u201cYou cannot really compare it to accounting because (in accounting) you have all the concepts,\" Chipashu said. \u201cWhen you are driving in the jungle, you are confused by other people who are not following the road rules.\u201d",
      "The southern African nation\u2019s roads turn most lethal during festive seasons and other holidays, but peril lurks daily, driven largely by dangerous driving that the government says is of alarming concern.",
      "Zimbabwe has one of Africa\u2019s highest road accident fatality rates, with the World Health Organization estimating nearly 30 deaths per 100,000 people.",
      "On the roads, the contradictions are stark. Minibus taxis bearing \u201csafety first\u201d signs swerve wildly into pedestrian lanes and oncoming traffic. Fare collectors hang off doors and the back of moving vehicles shouting for customers. Sedans jammed with 12 passengers, including in the trunk, defy five-seat limits.",
      "Authorities say 94% of road accidents in the country of 15 million people are caused by human error. Cellphone distractions among drivers and pedestrians cause about 10% of deaths, said Munesu Munodawafa, head of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe.",

The continent has the world\u2019s highest fatality rate at 26.6 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with a global average of about 18, according to the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa. This is despite the continent of 1.5 billion people accounting for just about 3% of the global vehicle population.",

      "The WHO links the surge in part to weak road safety laws and enforcement, reckless driving, and rapid urbanization and motorization. Vehicle registrations in Africa nearly tripled between 2013 and 2021, driven by imported used vehicles and a sharp rise in motorcycles and three-wheelers. Pedestrians, cyclists and riders of two- and three-wheelers account for about half of all fatalities, according to the U.N. agency.",
      "In Uganda, where unregulated motorcycles dominate transport, reckless overtaking and speeding caused 44.5% of crashes in 2024, police there say, while in neighboring Kenya and across East Africa, frequent accidents on poor roads and dangerous driving fuel repeated calls for tougher road safety rules.",
      "To increase road safety, police in Zimbabwe have recently acquired body cameras and breathalyzers and are pushing for a review of the driver licensing system, including docking points for offenders and a revamp of driver training programs to highlight the dangers of reckless driving.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it\u2019s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\u201d said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \u201cThey need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\u201d",

      "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- The Trump administration has told another coal-fired power facility to remain open, this time ordering the owners of a Colorado electricity generating unit to keep it running beyond its Wednesday retirement date.",
      "Compliance will cost Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association and the other owners of the Craig Station power plant in northwestern Colorado. The plant owners will need to fix a broken valve that put the power plant's 446-megawatt Unit 1 out of operation on Dec. 19, Tri-State said in a statement.",
      "The order from Energy Secretary Chris Wright follows recent Department of Energy moves to keep coal-fired power stations open in Indiana, Washington state and Michigan despite efforts by their owners to close them.",
      "It\u2019s part of President Donald Trump\u2019s push to revive the U.S. coal industry at a time when many utilities are shifting to cheaper, less-polluting energy sources such as natural gas and renewables. The administration, meanwhile, has blocked renewable energy, including wind power.",
      "The 45-year-old generator in Colorado, one of three at Craig Station, had been scheduled to close at the end of 2025.",
      "\u201cAs a not-for-profit cooperative, our membership will bear the costs of compliance with this order unless we can identify a method to share costs with those in the region,\u201d Tri-State CEO Duane Highley said in the statement.",
      "The power plant's owners had been planning since 2016 to shut down Unit 1 for economic reasons and to comply with \u201cnumerous state and federal requirements.\u201d",
      "Asked how much returning the unit to operation would cost and how long that would take, Tri-State spokesperson Amy Robertson said by email that the utility had no further information to share.",
      "The generator must remain operational to address a shortage of electricity and electrical generation in the northwestern U.S., Wright wrote in Tuesday's emergency order keeping the unit operational.",
      "\u201cThe Trump Administration is committed to lowering energy costs and keeping American families safe,\u201d Wright said in a release.",
      "Wade Gerber, who works at the power plant, said the announcement changes little for Colorado\u2019s coal country, which is undergoing a long-term shift away from the fossil fuel as a pillar of the local economy.",

    "story": [
      "Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are among the highlights of titles entering the public domain with the arrival of 2026",
      "LOS ANGELES -- LOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 Betty Boop and \u201cBlondie\u201d are joining Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh in the public domain.",
      "The first appearances of the classic cartoon and comic characters are among the pieces of intellectual property whose 95-year U.S. copyright maximum has been reached, putting them in the public domain on Jan. 1. That means creators can use and repurpose them without permission or payment.",
      "The 2026 batch of newly public artistic creations doesn't quite have the sparkle of the recent first entries into the public domain of Mickey or Winnie. But ever since 2019 \u2014 the end of a 20-year IP drought brought on by congressional copyright extensions \u2014 every annual crop has been a bounty for advocates of more work belonging to the public.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big year,\u201d said Jennifer Jenkins, law professor and director of Duke\u2019s Center for the Study of the Public Domain, for whom New Year's Day is celebrated as Public Domain Day. \u201cIt's just the sheer familiarity of all this culture.\u201d",
      "Jenkins said that, collectively, this year's work shows \u201cthe fragility that was between the two wars and the depths of the Great Depression.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s a closer look at what will enter the public domain on Thursday, based on the research of Jenkins and her center.",
      "Betty Boop began as a dog. Seriously.",
      "When she first appears in the 1930 short \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d one of four of her cartoons entering the public domain, she's already totally recognizable as the Jazz Age flapper later memorialized in countless tattoos, T-shirts and bumper stickers. She has her baby face, short hair with groomed curls, flashy eyelashes and miniature mouth. But she's also got dangling poodle ears and a tiny black nose. Those would soon morph into dangling earrings and a tiny white nose.",
      "She started as essentially the Minnie Mouse to a popular anthropomorphic dog named Bimbo, whom she would eventually outshine \u2014 and push aside. She's got a supporting role in \u201cDizzy Dishes,\u201d performing a slinky song-and-dance in a tiny black dress. She's not named, but sings \u201cboop boop, a doop.\u201d",
      "Jenkins suggests this canine Betty Boop could be rich for exploitation in new works, and has a free idea: \u201cShe was bitten by a radioactive dog, that\u2019s why she had this weird backstory,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cThis movie needs to be made.\u201d",
      "The character was designed and owned by Fleischer Studios, and the shorts were released by Paramount Pictures. She was based at least in part on singer Helen Kane, known as the \u201cBoop-Oop-a-Doop Girl,\u201d thanks to a hit 1929 song. Kane would lose a lawsuit over Betty Boop's character and use of the phrase. During the proceedings the defense alleged Black singer Esther Lee Jones used similar phrases first.",
      "Artists are now free to use this earliest Boop in films and similar work. But making merch won't be free. In an important distinction often raised by Disney over Mickey Mouse, a character's trademark is distinct from the copyright of works that feature them. The Fleischer Productions trademark of Betty Boop remains intact.",
      "Boops and doops were apparently in the air in 1930. Blondie Boopadoop was, like Betty, a young flapper, and the central character of Chic Young's newspaper comic strip that debuted in 1930. It inspired a film series and radio show, and is still running today in papers that still have comics.",
      "The strip followed her carefree breeze through life with her boyfriend, Dagwood Bumstead. The two would marry (and she would change her name) in 1933, and the strip would become the sandwich-heavy domestic comedy familiar to later readers. Though the strip was meant to be based on a woman's life, Dagwood would in many ways become its breakout star \u2014 a proto- Adam Driver, if you will, as the breakout actor from \u201cGirls.\u201d",
      "Nine new Mickey Mouse cartoons also are becoming public domain, two years after \u201cSteamboat Willie\u201d made the first version of him public property. He's joined this year by his dog Pluto, who, in 1930, was known as Rover. (He would get his long-term moniker the following year.)",

      "The NASCAR community is reeling after a series of tragic events",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The new year began with a celebration of life for Emma Biffle, the 14-year-old daughter of one of NASCAR\u2019s 75 greatest drivers who was among seven people killed when Greg Biffle\u2019s plane crashed just a week before Christmas.",
      "The service Sunday was standing room only as the performing arts center in suburban Cornelius wasn't large enough to accommodate the turnout from the racing community and Davidson Day, the private school where many sent their children alongside Emma.",
      "The heartbreaking memorial to a teenager lost in a tragic accident capped a month of sorrow for NASCAR with a new season just weeks away. The grieving isn't over, either, far from it.",
      "It's not like the 2025 season ended on the highest note: Denny Hamlin was again denied his first Cup Series championship on a late sequence of events in the season finale that gave the title to Kyle Larson. When Larson was done with his post-race news conference, there was a toast in honor of Jon Edwards, a Hendrick Motorsports communications executive and mentor to many who died unexpectedly in April, a loss felt all season.",
      "Then came December, usually the start of a quiet offseason in which teams and drivers and every member of the 38-week traveling circus unwinds. Instead, it opened with a bruising federal trial in which two race teams accused NASCAR of being a monopolistic bully; the Michael Jordan-led lawsuit included eight days of testimony that embarrassed NASCAR until the France family settled a day before Hall of Fame owners Rick Hendrick and Roger Penske were due to testify. The landmark agreement will change the current revenue sharing model.",
      "The relief was far too brief. Biffle's plane crashed Dec. 18 shortly after encountering an issue after takeoff from the nearby Statesville airport as the group tried to return for an emergency landing. Biffle was among those killed along with his wife, Cristina, five-year-old son, Ryder, and Emma, the only child from his first marriage.",
      "In a letter written by Nicole Biffle that she was too grief-stricken to read herself at her daughter's service, she agonized over her decision to allow Emma to fly that day knowing Emma wasn't feeling well. She had purchased tickets to Italy as a Christmas present for her daughter the night before the crash.",
      "Ten days after that tragedy, on the 52nd wedding anniversary of Denny Hamlin's parents, the house he built to repay them for their years of sacrifice to get the future Hall of Famer to NASCAR's top level, burned down. His father, Dennis, was killed. Mary Lou Hamlin was rushed to a hospital burn unit. Hamlin's childhood racing memorabilia was lost along with his father.",
      "If there was any animosity from NASCAR toward Hamlin, a co-owner of the race team with Jordan that sued the series, it dissipated in a heartfelt statement from the sanctioning body.",
      "\u201cDennis Hamlin instilled a love of racing in his son, and sacrificed greatly to develop Denny into a world-class talent in the sport,\u201d NASCAR said. \"We also continue to offer our thoughts and prayers to Denny\u2019s mother, Mary Lou, and hope for her full recovery.\u201d",
      "The racing community is a quirky one, with hundreds of people living not just in and around Charlotte but feet away from one another in motorhome parking lots in infields around the country for three-fourths of the year. Relationships can sometimes be contentious and grudges held for years, even decades.",

      "Myles Sansted kicked the extra point in overtime as Montana State won its first national championship since 1984, beating Illinois State 35-34 Monday night in the Football Championship Subdivision title game",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Montana State finally found a way to answer when it mattered most for the program\u2019s first national championship since 1984.",
      "A year ago, Montana State missed winning its first title in 40 years when a slow start doomed it in a shootout loss to North Dakota State. Two years ago, the Bobcats\u2019 season ended in Bozeman in the quarterfinals on a blocked extra point in overtime against the Bison.",
      "They started this season losing the first two \u2014 at Oregon and a double- overtime loss at home to South Dakota State.",
      "So when Myles Sansted\u2019s extra point went through the uprights in overtime for a 35-34 victory over Illinois State on Monday night in the Football Championship Subdivision title game, the Bobcats chucked helmets in the air while sprinting around with a heavy contingent of Montana State fans celebrating with them.",
      "\u201cTo be able to clear that hurdle and know that yes this \u201925 group accomplished what hadn\u2019t been done in a long time ...,\u201d said coach Brent Vigen, who\u2019s already thinking ahead with a young, Montana-laden team featuring only nine seniors. \u201cYou know, we\u2019re building for more.\u201d",
      "The Bobcats (14-2) capped a season that featured not one, but two wins over in-state rival Montana over a four-week span. Beating Montana in the semifinals put Montana State back into the title game for the second straight season, third in five years under Vigen and the fourth berth overall.",
      "Montana State topped that accomplishment with its 14th straight win in a thrilling finish in the first overtime in the 48 years of this title game. The Bobcats led 21-7 at halftime and 28-14 in the third. They needed Jhase McMillan\u2019s block of Michael Cosentino\u2019s 38-yard field goal attempt with 57 seconds left in regulation to keep it tied at 28.",
      "In overtime, Justin Lamson tied it with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Taco Dowler on fourth-and-10. Hunter Parsons blocked the extra point attempt after Tommy Rittenhouse threw a 10-yard TD pass to Dylan Lord to give Illinois State its only lead at 34-28 to open overtime.",
      "Stansted\u2019s kick started the celebration of the end of a long title drought. Along with the 1984 I-AA championship, Montana State also won the 1976 NCAA Division II title and 1956 NAIA championship.",
      "\u201cWhat a hard fought game, and these things aren\u2019t supposed to come easily I guess,\u201d Vigen said.",
      "Lamson, who didn\u2019t join the Bobcats until June, said the OT touchdown was a great play call.",
      "\u201cTaco was wide open,\u201d Lamson said. \u201cI got hit so I was just trying to give him a chance and the rest is history, and Myles did his thing and that was the game.\u201d",
      "Illinois State (12-5) already made history as the first FCS team to win four straight road games to advance through the playoffs to this championship game. That included a win over this postseason\u2019s No. 1 seed and North Dakota State \u2014 winners of 10 of the last 14 FCS championships including last year.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Venus Williams has lost her first singles match of 2026 to fifth-seeded Magda Linette at the WTA Tour tournament in Auckland, New Zealand.",
      "The 45-year-old Williams put up a superb show before losing 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 to the No. 52-ranked Linette, who was only two years old when Williams played her first professional singles match.",
      "Tuesday's match was Williams' 1,101st in singles on the WTA Tour. But the competitiveness she showed against a player 12 years her junior will give her confidence as she heads to Australia for the Hobart International and the Australian Open.",
      "The seven-time major champion received wild-card entries into the Auckland tournament and also in Hobart from Jan. 12 and at the first Grand Slam tournament of the year at Melbourne Park.",
      "The Auckland match was Williams' first since she lost 6-3, 2-6, 5-1 to Karolina Muchova in the first round of the U.S. Open last August. She played only three tournaments in 2025, beating Peyton Stearns in July to become the second-oldest woman \u2014 behind Martina Navratilova \u2014 to win a match on the WTA Tour.",
      "Williams appeared fit, moved freely, served seven aces and hit hard on both sides.",
      "\u201cLook at the level she brought. She moved really great,\u201d Linette said in a courtside TV interview. \"She was really hitting well, especially when she was running to the open space.",
      "\"It was really impressive and I really had to stay calm. She pushes you to a spot you don't want to be and that's where I was for a while, so I'm really glad I was able to refresh and come back with a little bit better game.\u201d",
      "Williams, ranked No. 582 this week, has been a regular visitor to Auckland in the latter part of her career. She beat Caroline Wozniacki in the 2015 final for the 41st of her 46 WTA Tour titles. This year, she told reporters, she felt under no pressure.",
      "\u201cThe biggest pressure is the one we put on ourselves, right?\u201d Williams said. \u201cAnd then when you look back and you\u2019re like, \u2018it wasn\u2019t such a big deal.\u2019",
      "\u201cSo hopefully I can look back with the 20/20 vision while I\u2019m in the present, like just let it go, let it flow, enjoy it and be in the moment. That\u2019s not easy to do and that\u2019s why people love sports, right?\u201d",

      "The multiday event, organized by the Consumer Technology Association, kicks off this week in Las Vegas, where advances across industries like robotics, healthcare, vehicles, wearables, gaming and more are set to be on display.",
      "Artificial intelligence will be anchored in nearly everything, again, as the tech industry explores offerings consumers will want to buy. AI industry heavyweight Jensen Huang will be taking the stage to showcase Nvidia's latest productivity solutions, and AMD CEO Lisa Su will keynote to \u201cshare her vision for delivering future AI solutions.\u201d Expect AI to come up in other keynotes, like from Lenovo's CEO, Yuanqing Yang.",
      "The AI industry is tackling issues in healthcare, with a particular emphasis on changing individual health habits to treat conditions \u2014 such as Beyond Medicine's prescription app focused on a particular jaw disorder \u2014 or addressing data shortages in subjects such as breast milk production.",

Hyundai also is announcing a major push on robotics and manufacturing advancements. Extended reality, basically a virtual training ground for robots and other physical AI, is also in the buzz around CES.",

And at this show, for the first time, we have a Korean company showing the first ever small-scale nuclear-powered energy creation device. We expect more and more of these people rushing to fill this gap because we need the energy, we need it clean and we need a kind of all-of-the-above solution.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Donald Trump hasn't minced words about the larger message he's trying to send the world with the U.S. military raid to capture Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and spirit the deposed Venezuelan leader and his wife to the United States to face federal drug trafficking charges.",
      "\u201cAmerican dominance in the Western Hemisphere,\" Trump declared following Maduro's capture, \u201cwill never be questioned again.\u201d",
      "In the days since the audacious raid, Trump and his team have doubled down on the notion that the new focus on American preeminence in the hemisphere is here to stay. He also held up Maduro's capture to make the case to neighbors to get in line or potentially face consequences.",
      "Trump\u2019s rhetoric harkens back to the muscular talk of the late 19th and early 20th centuries when American presidents deployed the military for territorial and resource conquests, including to Cuba, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Honduras, Panama, Nicaragua, Mexico, Haiti and the Dominican Republic.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been periods, Vietnam and Iraq, which have evoked questions about a return to American imperialism, but the U.S. leaders\u2019 messages in those periods were cloaked in talk of democracy. The way Trump is talking about it is something we haven\u2019t seen in a very long time.\u201d said Edward Frantz, a historian at the University of Indianapolis.",
      "In the aftermath of the operation, Trump's tough talk has been been directed at titular allies in Greenland \u2014 where he renewed calls for the U.S. to take over the Danish territory for national security reasons \u2014 and Mexico. Trump says America's southern neighbor needs to \u201cget their act together\u201d fighting drug cartels.",
      "Trump has also warned that longtime adversary Cuba is \u201cgoing down\u201d now that Maduro, who has provided deeply discounted oil to the economically isolated government in Havana, has been deposed. And the president has heightened anxiety with Venezuela's neighbor, telling reporters that a military operation in Colombia \u2014 the epicenter of global cocaine production \u2014 \"sounds good to me.\"",
      "The Republican president has also said his administration will \u201crun\u201d Venezuela policy and threatened the country's new leader, interim President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, with an outcome worse than Maduro's if she does not \u201cdo what\u2019s right.\u201d He's made plain that he expects Caracas to open its vast oil reserves to U.S. energy companies, further igniting speculation about American overreach.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure \u2014 the oil infrastructure \u2014 and start making money for the country,\u201d Trump said over the weekend.",
      "The Venezuela incursion has split Latin America, with Trump\u2011aligned leaders mostly from the right applauding the ouster, and non\u2011aligned leaders condemning it on sovereignty grounds. It's sharpened concerns that Trump might actually be serious about his desire to annex Greenland as well.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned Monday that Trump would mark the undoing of the transatlantic military alliance, NATO, if he attempts to follow through on his assertion that the U.S. \u201cabsolutely\u201d needs to take over Greenland for national security reasons. The alliance, which includes the U.S. and Denmark, has been a linchpin of post-World War II security.",
      "\u201cIf the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,\u201d Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2.",
      "In the early part of the 20th century, American leaders repeatedly turned to the Monroe Doctrine, a foundational U.S. foreign policy document authored by the nation's fifth president, which had been aimed at opposing European meddling in the Western Hemisphere.",

Ron DeSantis said Monday.",
      "Florida officials were waiting for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to sign off on the third detention center in the state's Panhandle, DeSantis said at a news conference outside the facility which was Florida's second immigration detention center, dubbed \u201cDeportation Deport,\u201d at the former Baker Correctional Institution in northeast Florida.",
      "\u201cSo, if they approve, we will open,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cIf they don't, then we will stand by, and that's fine. But I think it should be approved since I don't think they're where they need to be on detention space.\u201d",

Under the state initiative, 63% of those arrested had a criminal arrest or conviction, DeSantis said.",
      "Florida has led other states in constructing facilities to support President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown, with DeSantis saying the Trump administration needs the additional capacity to hold and deport more immigrants.

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- One of the world's rarest whale species is having more babies this year than in some recent seasons, but experts say many more young are needed to help stave off the possibility of extinction.",
      "The North Atlantic right whale's population numbers an estimated 384 animals and is slowly rising after several years of decline. The whales have gained more than 7% of their 2020 population, according to scientists who study them.",
      "The whales give birth off the southeastern United States every winter before migrating north to feed. Researchers have identified 15 calves this winter, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Monday.",
      "That number is higher than two of the last three winters, but the species needs \u201capproximately 50 or more calves per year for many years\u201d to stop its decline and allow for recovery, NOAA said in a statement. The whales are vulnerable to collisions with large ships and entanglement in commercial fishing gear.",
      "This year's number is encouraging, but the species remains in peril without stronger laws to protect against those threats, said Gib Brogan, senior campaign director with environmental group Oceana. The federal government is in the midst of a moratorium on federal rules designed to protect right whales until 2028, and commercial fishing groups have pushed for a proposal to extend that pause for even longer.",
      "There is still time left for more baby whales to be born this winter, but 50 is not a reasonable expectation because of a lack of reproductive females in the population, Brogan said.",

      "The whales have fared better than last winter, when they gave birth to only 11 calves, according to NOAA data. The whales have reached 20 calves only twice since 2010, and they gave birth to no calves in a disastrous 2018 season. The whales are less likely to reproduce when they have suffered injuries or are underfed, scientists have said.",
      "The whales were hunted to the brink of extinction during the era of commercial whaling and have been federally protected for decades. They remain in a crisis at the moment because there have been more deaths than births in the population in the past decade, NOAA said in its statement.",

      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, has yet to formally unveil the plaque. And the Trump administration\u2019s Department of Justice is seeking to dismiss a police officers' lawsuit asking that it be displayed as intended. The Architect of the Capitol, which was responsible for obtaining and displaying the plaque, said in light of the federal litigation, it cannot comment.",
      "Determined to preserve the nation's history, some 100 members of Congress, mostly Democrats, have taken it upon themselves to memorialize the moment. For months, they've mounted poster board-style replicas of the Jan. 6 plaque outside their office doors, resulting in a Capitol complex awash with makeshift remembrances.",
      "\u201cOn behalf of a grateful Congress, this plaque honors the extraordinary individuals who bravely protected and defended this symbol of democracy on Jan. 6, 2021,\u201d reads the faux bronze stand-in for the real thing. \u201cTheir heroism will never be forgotten.\u201d",
      "In Washington, a capital city lined with monuments to the nation\u2019s history, the plaque was intended to become a simple but permanent marker, situated near the Capitol\u2019s west front, where some of the most violent fighting took place as rioters breached the building.",
      "But in its absence, the missing plaque makes way for something else entirely \u2014 a culture of forgetting.",
      "Visitors can pass through the Capitol without any formal reminder of what happened that day, when a mob of President Donald Trump's supporters stormed the building trying to overturn the Republican's 2020 reelection defeat to Democrat Joe Biden. With memory left unchecked, it allows new narratives to swirl and revised histories to take hold.",
      "Five years ago, the jarring scene watched the world over was declared an \u201cinsurrection\u201d by the then-GOP leader of the Senate, while the House GOP leader at the time called it his \u201csaddest day\u201d in Congress. But those condemnations have faded.",

      "At least five people died in the riot and its aftermath, including Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, who was fatally shot by police while trying to climb through a window toward the House chamber. More than 140 law enforcement officers were wounded, some gravely, and several died later, some by suicide.",
      "All told, some 1,500 people were charged in the Capitol attack, among the largest federal prosecutions in the nation\u2019s history. When Trump returned to power in January 2025, he pardoned all of them within hours of taking office.",
      "Unlike the twin light beams that commemorated the Sept. 11, 2001, attack or the stand-alone chairs at the Oklahoma City bombing site memorial, the failure to recognize Jan. 6 has left a gap not only in memory but in helping to stitch the country back together.",

      "NEW YORK -- A defiant Nicol\u00e1s Maduro declared himself \"the president of my country\u201d as he protested his capture and pleaded not guilty Monday to federal drug trafficking charges that the Trump administration used to justify removing him from power in Venezuela.",
      "\u201cI was captured,\u201d Maduro said in Spanish as translated by a courtroom interpreter before being cut off by the judge. Asked later for his plea to the charges, he stated: \"I am innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the constitutional president of my country.\u201d",
      "Maduro\u2019s court appearance in Manhattan, his first since he and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized from their Caracas home Saturday in a stunning middle-of-the-night military operation, kicked off the U.S. government\u2019s most consequential prosecution in decades of a foreign head of state.

But, given the circumstances of his arrest and the geopolitical stakes at play, he\u2019ll also be nearly \u2014 but not quite \u2014 unique.",
      "That was made clear from the outset as Maduro, who took copious notes throughout the proceedings and wished Happy New Year to reporters as he entered the courtroom, repeatedly pressed his case that he had been unlawfully abducted.",

      "\u2014 PCV or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the overhaul was in response to a request from President Donald Trump in December. Trump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.",
      "HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an \u201coutlier\u201d in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.",
      "However, many European countries recommend some of the vaccines the U.S. removed from its list.",
      "The nation's large doctors' groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, say they will continue to recommend the vaccines that the Trump administration has now demoted. They said there was no new science that warranted the changes, including no signs that the former U.S. vaccine schedule harmed children.",
      "Dr. Sean O'Leary of the AAP said the changes could increase child illness and death from preventable disease. He voiced special concern that the U.S. would no longer recommend flu vaccine for children, just as the flu season is becoming severe and after last winter's particularly harsh season.",
      "The pediatricians' group has issued its own child vaccine recommendations. Also, states, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While CDC requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the Trump administration\u2019s guidance on vaccines.",
      "It's not yet clear. Because of the countering recommendations from pediatricians, doctor visits may not change. However, medical specialists say when the U.S. government doesn't explicitly recommend a shot, it will raise questions among parents, leading to more difficult conversations at the doctor's office.",
      "If the changes mean fewer children are vaccinated, outbreaks that have historically been prevented by high vaccination rates could spread more widely, leading to more disease and more missed school and work.",
      "The Trump administration said coverage will continue for families that still want the shots. Health insurers generally find vaccination a good deal, as shots are cheaper than hospitalizations, and many had previously said they'd planned to cover what was recommended last year through 2026.",

    "summary": "The HBO Max drama immerses viewers in the struggles faced by the ER staff at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. \"Sunday Morning\" visits the hyper-realistic set, and talks with star, writer, director and executive producer Noah Wyle.",
    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "New Year's Day commemorates the passing of time and the start of a new chapter, so it is fitting that the same day also presents an opportunity to breathe new life into thousands of creative works nearly a century old. As of Jan. 1, 2026, characters like early Betty Boop and Nancy Drew, and a variety of popular movies, books and songs, have entered the the public domain.",
      "They join a growing list of cultural icons that are no longer under copyright protection, including Popeye the Sailor Man and the \"Steamboat Willie\" version of Mickey Mouse.",
      "List of popular intellectual property entering the public domain in 2026",
      "The year 2026 marks the first time that copyrighted books, films, songs and art published in the '30s enter the U.S. public domain. As of Jan. 1, protections have expired for published works from 1930 and sound recordings from 1925.",
      "Here are some of the most notable works that are now available for free use by anyone:",
      "\"The Murder at the Vicarage\" by Agatha Christie, the first novel featuring elderly amateur detective Miss Marple.\"The Secret of the Old Clock\" by Carolyn Keene, the first appearance of teen detective Nancy Drew, and three follow-ups.\"The Little Engine That Could\" by Watty Piper.Fleischer Studios' \"Dizzy Dishes,\" the first cartoon in which Betty Boop appears.Disney's \"The Chain Gang\" and \"The Picnic,\" both depicting the earliest versions of Mickey's dog Pluto.The initial four months of \"Blondie\" comic strips by Chic Young, featuring the earliest iterations of the titular character and her then-boyfriend, Dagwood.The film \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" directed by Lewis Milestone, Best Picture winner at the 3rd Academy Awards.\"King of Jazz,\" directed by John Murray Anderson, Bing Crosby's first appearance in a feature film.\"Animal Crackers,\" directed by Victor Heerman and starring the Marx Brothers.\"The Big Trail,\" directed by Raoul Walsh, John Wayne's first turn as leading man.\"But Not For Me,\" music by George Gershwin, lyrics by Ira Gershwin.\"Georgia on My Mind,\" music by Hoagy Carmichael, lyrics by Stuart Gorrell.\"Dream a Little Dream of Me,\" music by Fabian Andre and Wilbur Schwandt, lyrics by Gus Kahn.\"Livin' in the Sunlight, Lovin' in the Moonlight,\" music by Al Sherman, lyrics by Al Lewis.Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",

      "Piet Mondrian's painting, \"Composition with Red, Blue, and Yellow.\"",
      "How the public domain works",
      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics. Additionally, the character is subject to multiple trademarks, which further complicates its use.",
      "What's entering the public domain in 2027?",
      "Copyrighted works from 1931 will see their protections expire in 2027. This includes Universal Pictures' \"Frankenstein\" and \"Dracula\" films, Charlie Chaplin's \"City Lights,\" Fritz Lang's \"M,\" Herman Hupfeld's jazz standard \"As Time Goes By\" and more.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:48 -0500",
    "summary": "George Clooney and his wife, Amal Clooney, were granted French citizenship because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said.",
    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

    "story": [
      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",
      "Like the injectable version of Wegovy, the pill is intended to help patients shed body weight when coupled with diet and exercise. Novo Nordisk said that people who used the oral medication during phase 3 of clinical trials lost about 14% of their body weight, while those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17%.",

    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 11:11:22 -0500",
    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

    "story": [
      "Representatives from petroleum giants Chevron, ConocoPhillips and ExxonMobil are planning to meet with the Trump administration later this week to discuss Venezuela, two sources confirmed to CBS News.",
      "The meeting is expected to take place Thursday with Energy Secretary Chris Wright, one source familiar with the matter said.",
      "The meetings come as President Trump pushes U.S. oil companies to invest in Venezuela's oil industry, following the U.S. military's capture of former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on Saturday.",
      "Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, but its oil industry has languished after years of mismanagement, underinvestment and tight U.S. sanctions. The country produces around 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, according to OPEC, most of which is exported to China \u2014 representing less than 1% of global oil production.",
      "Chevron is the only major U.S. petroleum company that currently operates in Venezuela under a special license from the Treasury Department. ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips left the country in 2007, after Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez, demanded that Venezuela's state-run oil company take majority stakes in the country's oil ventures.",
      "It remains uncertain whether U.S. firms will reinvest in Venezuela right away. Experts say it would take companies years to build out their operations in Venezuela, and many oil companies could tread lightly because of political uncertainty.",
      "White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said: \"All of our oil companies are ready and willing to make big investments in Venezuela that will rebuild their oil infrastructure, which was destroyed by the illegitimate Maduro regime. American oil companies will do an incredible job for the people of Venezuela and will represent the United States well.\"",
      "A Chevron spokesperson declined to comment to CBS News on whether it plans to boost production in Venezuela, saying it \"remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" ExxonMobil did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "American Petroleum Institute spokesperson Bethany Williams said the trade group is \"closely watching developments involving Venezuela.\"",
      "\"Globally, energy companies make investment decisions based on stability, the rule of law, market forces, and long-term operational considerations,\" Williams added.",

      "Energy industry stocks and oil prices are rising after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife in a military operation on Saturday.",
      "In Wall Street trading on Monday, shares in Chevron \u2014 the only U.S. oil company\u00a0operating in Venezuela\u00a0\u2014 jumped $7.95, or 5.1%, on the day to close at $163.85. Exxon Mobil's stock increased 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.6%",
      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",
      "\"Crucially, we already expect lower oil prices to drive a modest decline in domestic U.S. oil production into 2027, and so the broader backdrop is hardly conducive to large-scale investments in new high-cost wells in Venezuela,\" he said in a client note.",

    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The Polymarket wager could violate the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), a federal law regulating futures and options trading, experts told CBS News. Specifically, the CEA prohibits gambling on events related to assassination, terrorism and war.",
      "Kelleher also said the incident highlights the potential risks for other prediction market users.",
      "\"Consumers and investors should know that these are totally unregulated, non-transparent markets and that the odds of losing money are incredibly high,\" he said.",
      "Piepgrass told CBS News that the Maduro bet marks a \"flashpoint\" in the debate around what he characterized as inadequate regulation of such markets. Enabling insiders with access to confidential information to place bets on the trading forums would disadvantage other customers, he said.",
      "\"It's about fundamental fairness,\" Piepgrass said. \"Do you want to be placing bets in an area where some people have information directly relevant to winning that bet, but you do not? If you are a consumer, you have to really question, is that a market you want to participate in.\"",

      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration is counting on Big Oil to revive Venezuela's creaky energy sector. That's no sure bet, according to industry experts.",
    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving the country's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "A pill form of weight-loss drug Wegovy, manufactured by Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, is now available in the U.S., giving Americans access to an oral medication to treat obesity.",
      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",
      "Ed Cinca, senior vice president of marketing and patient solutions at Novo Nordisk, said in a statement that the new drug represents a \"significant innovation,\" describing it as the \"first and only\" GLP-1 pill for weight loss.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the pill version\u00a0of Wegovy in December. Competitor Eli Lilly's obesity pill,\u00a0orforglipron, is still being reviewed by the FDA.",
      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive served as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway and oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company. He's exhibited a commitment to Berkshire's decentralized structure, which gives acquired companies a large degree of autonomy to run their operations.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax. He had previously resided in San Francisco.",

    "summary": "Tesla's electric vehicle sales fell 9% in 2025 from a year ago amid the expiration of a $7,500 EV U.S. tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",

    "summary": "The one-year delay comes as President Trump has rolled back some other import duties amid affordability concerns.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina. Between 1999 to 2009, North Carolina's furniture industry lost half of its jobs due to increased competition from Asia, according to a 2020 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.",

    "story": [
      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jill A. Otake last week upheld the law, and the plaintiffs appealed to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The U.S. government intervened in the case and also appealed Otake's ruling.",
      "The order by two 9th Circuit judges granted both requests for an injunction pending the appeals.",
      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",
      "The order temporarily halts enforcement of the law on cruise ships while the appeals process moves forward, her email noted.",

    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "The average rate on a 30-year U.S. mortgage fell to its lowest level of 2025 this week, a boost for prospective home buyers.",
      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago.

      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",
      "Trucking trade groups have praised the effort to get unqualified drivers who shouldn't have licenses or can't speak English off the road. They also applauded the Transportation Department's moves to go after questionable commercial driver's license schools.",
      "And while the federal government says the licenses are illegal and the state says the feds are overreaching, some people in the trucking industry say they're the ones caught in the middle, reports CBS News Sacramento.",

      "One of the new Senate bills, reviewed Tuesday by CBS News, would outlaw the establishment of any compensation fund to award money to rioters. Another piece of legislation would prohibit the use of federal tax money to pay for civil legal settlements against Jan. 6 defendants who were convicted of assaulting police.",
      "The latter of the two bills is titled the \"No Settlements for 5 January 6 Law Enforcement Assaulters Act.\" It is sponsored by Sen. Alex Padilla, a California Democrat who serves as vice-chair of the Senate Rules Committee, which has oversight of the Capitol grounds and the U.S. Capitol Police. The legislation is also sponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee.",
      "Supporters of some Jan. 6 riot defendants have championed the idea of a reparations fund to reimburse the criminal defendants \u2014 most of whom were pardoned by President Trump shortly after he returned to office last year \u2014 for the cost of their prosecutions and expenses.",
      "Mark McCloskey, an attorney whose social media page says he is \"championing the cause of J6 compensation,\" posted on his X feed in August: \"To all the J6 political prisoners out there- I'm doing everything I can to [expedite] the establishment of a claims resolution procedure so we can get you back on your feet and get you some real justice.\"",
      "\"I won't stop fighting and I will never back down,\" he wrote.",
      "The Trump administration has already approved at least one civil settlement in connection with the mob that overran the Capitol on Jan 6, 2021. The Justice Department approved an approximately $5 million settlement to the family of Ashli Babbitt, who was shot and killed by a Capitol Police officer while she breached a smashed window into the House Speaker's Lobby.",
      "It's not clear if the administration is considering other financial settlements with Jan. 6 rioters. CBS News has reached out to the Justice Department for comment on the new legislation.",
      "When asked about the prospect of Jan. 6 reparation payments, former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn told CBS News: \"This reeks of audacity. Not only did they get a pardon, they are saying they deserve a payday for the crimes they committed.\"",
      "Padilla told CBS News his legislation \"would hold these rioters accountable and protect taxpayers by putting an end to Donald Trump's callous attempt to rewrite history.\"",
      "\"These insurrectionists should still be serving their sentences and paying fines for damages they caused to the Capitol \u2014 not receiving refunds or cash rewards from the Trump Administration,\" Padilla said.",
      "In a statement, Whitehouse said: \"No matter how Trump's MAGA goons now try to twist it, the January 6 attack on our Capitol was an assault on our democracy. Trump's blanket day-one pardons for members of the January 6 mob were a slap in the face to the brave law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect the country.\""

      "In a legal filing Monday, the Justice Department told a judge it has released about 12,285 documents so far, totaling some 125,575 pages. More than 2 million documents that may need to be released under the law are still \"in various phases of review.\"",
      "That means the department has reviewed less than 1% of its total possible records on Epstein, though it noted that it believes a \"meaningful portion\" of the still-unreviewed documents are duplicates. It also said the documents' page counts vary widely.",
      "The documents that are under review include internal Justice Department and FBI emails, court filings, notes from FBI interviews, records from subpoenas and \"various forms of media,\" the court filing said.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act, passed in mid-November, gave the Justice Department 30 days to release a wide swath of files on Epstein and his convicted associate, Ghislaine Maxwell. That includes decades-old records from the earliest federal investigations into Epstein, documents from Epstein and Maxwell's 2019 and 2020 sex trafficking cases and files from the Justice Department's review of Epstein's death by suicide while in pre-trial custody.",
      "The law allows the Justice Department to redact victims' personal information, child sexual abuse material, images that show bodily injuries and a small handful of other categories.",
      "The Manhattan judge in Maxwell's case, U.S. District Judge Paul Engelmeyer, has also required the top prosecutor in the district to \"personally certify\" that any grand jury materials that are released have been \"rigorously reviewed\" to take out victims' identities. The Justice Department's revelations Monday about the number of files appeared in a letter to Engelmeyer.",
      "Over 400 Justice Department lawyers are involved in the review process, the filing said.",
      "It's not clear how long it will take the department to release all of the files, or when the next tranche will be made public. The Justice Department revealed on Christmas Eve that it had discovered over a million new documents, and reviewing them could take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "The Justice Department has defended its handling of the files, arguing it needs to release them on a rolling schedule in order to protect victims' personal information.",
      "But the department's pace \u2014 and the fact that it missed Congress' deadline \u2014 has drawn backlash from congressional Democrats and Epstein survivors. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused the department of a \"cover-up\" last month.",
      "\"The law Congress passed is crystal clear: release the Epstein files in full so Americans can see the truth,\" Schumer said in a statement.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, officials tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.",
      "The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.",
      "Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.",
      "The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.",
      "According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.",
      "One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. \"This is a massive resource allocation,\" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming \"the new Chicago,\" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.",
      "Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.",
      "The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.",
      "Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.",
      "In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities \u2014 particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.",
      "President Trump has regularly cited Somalia \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and said they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.",
      "But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns. The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 20:18:42 -0500",
    "summary": "The new CDC recommendations suggest reducing the number of vaccinations all children should receive.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

      "Surrounded by Drug Enforcement Agency agents, the shackled Maduro shuffled from the helicopter to an armored vehicle, and was then driven to a federal courthouse, where he was greeted by the New York City Police Department and protesters \u2014 on one side of the street were those cheering Maduro's downfall, and on the other were those opposing his capture and detention.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Maduro, clad in a prison jumpsuit, was initially defiant, declaring through a translator that he is a \"decent man,\" innocent of all charges.",
      "\"I am still president of my country,\" he said. Meanwhile in Caracas, Maduro's vice president and longtime confidant Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as interim president.",
      "Both Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty.",
      "At one point, it seemed Maduro was trying to grandstand, but U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein cut him off, like he would anyone, saying he just needed to know Maduro's identity and if he understood his rights and the charges against him.",
      "Maduro\u00a0faces four counts of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons-related offenses. He was indicted during President Trump's first term in 2020.

      "Flores' attorney, Mark Donnelly, said she may have suffered an injury to her ribs during the early Saturday morning operation to capture her and Maduro.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that he won't seek reelection, a surprise exit from politics less than 18 months after the Democrat was chosen to be the party's nominee for vice president.",
      "Walz was seeking an unprecedented third straight term as Minnesota's governor. But the 180 came amid intense scrutiny over fraud schemes in the North Star State, which has seen a resurgence in recent weeks.",
      "While Walz is not implicated in the fraud issues, the reality that the schemes have become an urgent problem under his watch has enveloped talk of the Minnesotan governor's future political ambitions.",
      "From VP pick to ending his reelection bid",
      "Walz, a former high school social studies teacher, coach and congressman who served in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, vaulted into the national political scene during the summer of 2024 as Democratic President Joe Biden faced questions about whether he should stay in the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance.",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race and former Vice President Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the ticket, Harris turned to Walz as her pick for vice president, opting for the former football coach from a blue state over contenders from more traditional presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats rallied around Harris and Walz, and the Minnesota governor's stripped-back, folksy style \u2014 like describing Republican candidates as \"weird\" \u2014 seemed to add to the ticket's appeal. But a lackluster performance during that fall's vice presidential debate did little to help the party avoid stinging losses in November 2024.",
      "In the wake of that loss, Walz held nationally-focused town halls in several states while also being seen as a potential candidate for the 2028 presidential election. Last year, he announced he would run for a third term as governor.",
      "An uproar over Minnesota fraud",
      "Walz's name came back into the national spotlight in recent months, amid uproar over a series of multimillion-dollar pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota. Though Walz isn't implicated in the scheme, he's served as the state's governor since 2019, and his administration has faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children. Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in the scheme, and failed to carry out due diligence. But the issue saw a resurgence late last year.",
      "The criticism over Minnesota fraud rose to the top GOP ranks, and President Trump directed his ire over the issue at Walz, including with a post on Truth Social on Thanksgiving where he used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe the Minnesota governor. And the Treasury Department said last month that it would investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Meanwhile, House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Walz: \"I can't give a political campaign my all\"",
      "Scrutiny over the fraud scandal hasn't died down in recent weeks. And in his statement announcing an end to his gubernatorial bid, Walz cited the scheme.",
      "Walz acknowledged that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity,\" adding that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "\"I won't mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies \u2013 in Washington, in St. Paul, and online \u2013 want to make our state a colder, meaner place,\" Walz said. \"They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.\"",
      "Walz outlined his administration's effort to combat fraud, saying \"across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem.\" But he said there's \"more to do,\" and \"the buck stops with me.\"",
      "The second-term governor said while he announced a reelection bid in September, he's come to the conclusion in recent weeks that \"I can't give a political campaign my all,\" specifically citing the fraud scandal.",
      "\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" Walz said. \"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"",
      "In a statement on Walz's decision, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the No. 3 House Republican, simply said, \"Good riddance.\"",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed new details Monday about the U.S. operation to capture and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, describing a meticulously planned raid that caught the Venezuelan leader completely off guard.",
      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",
      "\"We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again, not to get it right, but to ensure that we cannot get it wrong,\" Caine said.",
      "CIA personnel inside Venezuela had been tracking Maduro's movements since August, including through an agent who penetrated his inner circle and provided key intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",
      "Meanwhile, a massive U.S. military presence remains positioned off Venezuela's coast. American forces are planning to intercept another sanctioned oil tanker they've been pursuing for months, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.",

    "story": [
      "Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz says he is dropping his reelection campaign amid increased criticism over his handling of fraud in the state.",
      "Walz initially announced his run for a third term as governor in\u00a0September, but says he reevaluated the decision over the holidays.",
      "\"I came to the conclusion that I can't give a political campaign my all. Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" he said. \"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"",
      "He held a news conference after announcing he'd end his reelection bid. He took no questions, though he said he'd answer some on Tuesday while providing an update on the state's new paid family leave program.",
      "The two-term Democrat and former vice presidential candidate has faced scrutiny in the last several months over his handling of Medicaid fraud, which has cost the state as much as $9 billion, according to a top prosecutor. Walz has stated that his administration is taking aggressive measures to prevent future fraud.",
      "\"All across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem. Advocates, administrators, investigators are on the front lines defending the integrity of our state's programs, and I want to thank them for their efforts,\" Walz said. \"There's more to do. A single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud is a dollar too much to tolerate. And while there's a role to play for everyone \u2013 from the legislature to prosecutors to insurance companies to local and county government \u2013 the buck stops with me. My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.",
      "Walz has also been the target of attacks by President Trump. On Thanksgiving, Mr. Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe Walz on his Truth Social platform. During a media availability Sunday, Trump called Walz \"a very stupid, low-IQ governor.\"",
      "Over the weekend, Mr. Trump reposted a conspiracy theory video alleging Walz was behind the political assassination of Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman.",
      "Hortman, Walz's close friend and political ally, was slain in her home alongside her husband on June 14. The man accused of killing the two of them, as well as injuring state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, faces several federal charges, including two counts of murder.",
      "Walz decried the president's post, calling it \"dangerous, depraved behavior.\"",
      "Walz, a former Congressman and teacher, was first elected governor in 2018. During his tenure, he made several progressive victories, spurred in part by a once-in-a-decade DFL trifecta in the legislature. In the months of the 2023 legislative session, he was able to pass universal free school meals, legalize the use of recreational marijuana, and create a state program for paid family and medical leave.",
      "\"I'm confident that a DFLer will hold this seat come November. I'm confident that I will find ways to contribute to the state I love even after I've left office next January. But there will be time to worry about all that later,\" he said.",
      "A source close to Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar says she is considering running for governor, but has not made a decision.",
      "Walz added that he's leaving the race with \"zero sadness and zero regret.\"",
      "\"Most of all, I want Minnesotans to know that I'm on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America's best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch,\" he said.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "summary": "Two U.S. intelligence officials said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing Soviet-era defense systems and armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes.",
    "story": [
      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces plan to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning said the interdiction mission could come as early as this week but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "On Monday, The New York Times reported that at least 16 oil tankers have attempted to evade the U.S. naval blockade by disguising their geographical locations or turning off their transmission beacons.",
      "If the Marinera is captured by American forces, it would be the third oil tanker seized by the United States since it began its campaign against Venezuela in early September.",

    "summary": "The 92-year-old senior U.S. district judge has repeatedly rejected efforts by President Trump to remove his New York State criminal case to federal court.",
    "story": [
      "Alvin Hellerstein was 64 years old when former President Bill Clinton appointed him to the federal bench. That was more than a quarter century ago. Now, the 92-year-old senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York adds former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to his roster of prominent, famed and infamous defendants \u2014 but he's not the first former head of state to come before Hellerstein's court.",
      "Hellerstein has repeatedly rejected efforts by President Trump to remove his New York State criminal case to federal court, penning withering criticisms of Mr. Trump's arguments that the facts at the heart of his \"hush money\" case warranted official acts conducted during his first presidency. Mr. Trump was found guilty by a state jury in that case, which revolved around reimbursements made to a former Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, for a payment just before the 2016 presidential election to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.",
      "\"Reimbursing Cohen for advancing hush money to Stephanie Clifford cannot be considered the performance of a constitutional duty,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty.\"",
      "But a 2024 ruling by the Supreme Court has forced Hellerstein to reconsider that determination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered Hellerstein to reexamine arguments around presidential immunity, factoring the Supreme Court's landmark decision that upended multiple Trump cases.",
      "Hellerstein was also the judge assigned to preside over an American Civil Liberties Union effort that challenged the deportation of two Venezuelans last year. Hellerstein granted a temporary restraining order protecting deportees in the Southern District of New York from being removed prior to receiving due process. The case was filed on behalf of two Venezuelans\u00a0challenging the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.",
      "The no-nonsense judge also recently presided over the 2025 trial of Charlie Javice, who was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by lying about the size of her company's customer base. That company, Frank, claimed to revolutionize the way college students applied for financial aid.",
      "Hellerstein has presided over matters tied to the Maduro case since 2014 when he was assigned to a related case. He oversaw a superseding indictment naming Maduro in 2020. Monday's hearing was, of course, the first time the lead defendant has appeared in Hellerstein's court.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended American military actions in Venezuela during an emergency meeting at the United Nations on Monday, and argued that there is no regime change nor U.S. occupation. He repeated the Trump administration's argument that the air and ground assault was not an attack but rather military force used as a tool to assist a law enforcement operation.",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio has said, there is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,\" Waltz said, according to the readout. \"This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades. The United States arrested a narcotrafficker who is now going to stand trial in the United States in accordance with the rule of law for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years.\"",
      "\"This is not regime change this is justice,\" Waltz wrote in a social media post on Saturday.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he is \"deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela,\" saying it has \"potential worrying implications for the region.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law,\" the statement said.",
      "France's foreign minister has already condemned the operation as violating international law, although President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he \"neither supported nor approved\" the operation, according to France 24.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Margaret Brennan on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters\" when pressed as to whether the U.S. had ruled out an occupation of Venezuela. Rubio argued that President Trump would not explicitly rule out anything and maintained the power to invoke military force if there are imminent threats. He emphasized that economic pressure was the main tool being used on the remaining indicted regime members who currently run the country.",
      "As noted by Brennan, other officials in Maduro's government who are still in power in Venezuela, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who have also been indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and have multi-million dollar U.S. government bounties on their heads. Rubio argued Sunday that it was not feasible to arrest four individuals in five different locations in a single complex raid and that there would have been outcry if the U.S. attempted to do so.",
      "\"Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority,\" Rubio said.",
      "As for the Trump administration's ability to control the current regime, Rubio emphasized that the main pressure remains cutting off their financial lifelines.",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",

They were brought to the U.S. on Saturday after being captured by U.S. forces in an attack that President Trump described as \"a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader,\" following months of military buildup.",
      "Charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine and narcotics importation/exportation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, among others. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a 92-year-old who has been on the bench since 1998, is presiding over the case.",
      "Maduro and Flores pleaded not guilty to all charges. Maduro faces four counts, and Flores has been charged with three offenses. Four others are named in the indictment as co-defendants, including Maduro's son and Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello.",

      "Pollack works for the firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP. He helped broker the plea deal that saw Assange plead guilty in 2024 to a single felony count for publishing U.S. military secrets.",
      "According to his firm, Pollack obtained a complete acquittal of the former Enron Corp. executive, Michael Krautz, on criminal fraud charges. This was one of only two cases that resulted in acquittals in the numerous prosecutions arising out of the collapse of Enron.",

      "Clayton, the top federal prosecutor for the region, signed the indictment against Maduro and his wife. He began serving as interim U.S. attorney in April, and in August, the judges on the U.S. district court voted to allow him to continue serving in the role. He will remain U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York unless the Senate confirms or Mr. Trump selects another candidate to replace him.",
      "Clayton served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration. He was a partner at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP before joining the SEC, and returned there after his tenure at the commission ended in December 2020.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is also facing a dwindling majority. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

    "summary": "An indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with drug trafficking was unsealed Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine into the United States and enrich himself, his family and senior members of the Venezuelan government.",
      "The indictment was unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken into military custody in an overnight operation and brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Maduro, Flores and four others are named as defendants in the indictment, including Maduro's son, Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro; Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello; its former interior minister, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn; and a leader of the gang Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.",
      "It's unclear whether the U.S. has arrested Maduro's son. The other three defendants were not taken into custody.",
      "Maduro and Flores could appear in court in Manhattan as early as Monday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The case against them was brought in the Southern District of New York, where Maduro and 14 others were first indicted in March 2020, during the first Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein is overseeing the case.",
      "The plane carrying Maduro landed at an airport in the Hudson Valley on Saturday afternoon. The Venezuelan leader was expected to be turned over to federal authorities and arraigned at the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York next week, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Secured by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, the superseding indictment alleges that for more than 25 years, \"leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"",
      "Prosecutors place Maduro at the \"forefront of the corruption,\" and say that he and his associates worked with drug traffickers and narco-terrorists to flood the U.S. with \"thousands of tons of cocaine.\" This drug trafficking, according to the indictment, enriched Maduro, his family and members of Venezuela's political and military elite.",
      "\"This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect and transport tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment states.",
      "Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy; cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machineguns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices.",
      "\"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,\" President Trump said in a press conference from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, earlier Saturday.",
      "The indictment alleges that Maduro has used his various positions in the Venezuelan government to transport cocaine. Prosecutors said that as minister of foreign affairs, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers to help them move drug proceeds from Mexico back to Venezuela under diplomatic cover and facilitated the movement of private planes under diplomatic cover to evade law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "Maduro and his wife also allegedly worked together between 2004 and 2015, with the help of military escorts, to traffic cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement. Prosecutors said the two maintained their own groups of state-sponsored gangs to facilitate and protect their drug-trafficking operation. They are accused of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders against people who owed them money or who undermined their drug-trafficking operation.",
      "Prosecutors said that after Maduro became president in 2013, he and others authorized the arrest of certain Venezuelan military officials to divert scrutiny away from them after French authorities seized 1.3 tons of cocaine that had been dispatched on a commercial flight from Venezuela to Paris.",
      "Maduro's wife is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the head of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, according to the indictment. The trafficker then arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres to ship cocaine, and Flores received a portion of it, prosecutors said.",
      "Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in 2015 and is a fugitive.",

      "AI-generated images of Maduro flood social media",
      "After President Trump announced Maduro's capture in a social media post early Saturday morning, questions brewed about the logistics of the mission, where Maduro would be flown and the future of Venezuela. Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",

      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump posted an image captioned \"Nicolas Maduro on board the USS Iwo Jima\" after the South American leader's capture. Later that evening, the White House Rapid Response account shared a video that appeared to show Maduro being escorted down a hallway by federal agents.",
      "Old images recirculate",
      "Old videos and images from past events recirculated, purporting to show reactions to Maduro's capture and strikes in Caracas. One video showing people tearing down a billboard image of Maduro dates as far back as July 2024. Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",

      "Elon Musk's Grok, the chatbot developed by his company xAI, acknowledged \"lapses in safeguards\" on the AI platform that allowed users to generate digitally altered, sexualized photos of minors.",
      "The admission comes after multiple users alleged on social media that people are using Grok to generate suggestive images of minors, in some cases stripping them of clothing they were wearing in original photos.",
      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",

Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 22:24:48 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area, officials tells CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has begun a massive deployment of hundreds of Department of Homeland Security agents to the Twin Cities area as it escalates its federal crackdown amid a widening fraud scandal\u00a0in Minnesota, multiple law enforcement officials familiar with the plan told CBS News.",
      "The crackdown could involve roughly 2,000 agents and officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation branch and Homeland Security Investigations, the agency's investigative arm tasked with fighting transnational crimes, the officials said. They requested anonymity to discuss operations that have not been publicly announced.",
      "The plan is for the agents and officers to oversee a 30-day surge in operations in the Twin Cities area, making the region the first major target of the Trump administration's expanded immigration crackdown in the new year, officials said. Agents deployed from Homeland Security Investigations are expected to probe alleged cases of fraud, building on last month's inspection of dozens of sites in the Minneapolis area.",
      "Officials said U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commander Gregory Bovino, who has overseen controversial immigration roundups in Los Angeles, Chicago, Charlotte and New Orleans, is expected to arrive in Minnesota to help lead immigration enforcement efforts, along with an unknown number of U.S. Border Patrol personnel.",
      "The deployment, which began Sunday, represents one of the largest concentrations of DHS personnel in an American city in recent years. The move greatly expands the federal law enforcement footprint in Minnesota at a time of heightened political and community tension there.",
      "According to senior law enforcement officials, the surge includes several hundred additional agents from Homeland Security Investigations, as well as hundreds of officers from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, which carries out immigration arrests and deportations. Tactical units known as Special Response Teams are also slated to be part of the operation, along with a layered command structure of dozens of high-ranking supervisors.",
      "One former law enforcement official described the scale as extraordinary, noting that the number of HSI agents being sent to Minneapolis is roughly equivalent to the entire HSI workforce assigned to the state of Arizona. \"This is a massive resource allocation,\" the official said, adding that Minneapolis is effectively becoming \"the new Chicago,\" referencing past large-scale federal enforcement deployments in Illinois.",
      "Multiple officials told CBS News the total federal presence could ultimately become even larger, with as many as 600 HSI agents and up to 1,500 ICE ERO officers rotating through the Minneapolis area over the course of the month-long deployment.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.",
      "Late last year, ICE launched an immigration enforcement campaign in the Twin Cities, dubbed Operation Metro Surge, targeting immigrants who had been issued deportation orders, including those from Somalia. As of Dec. 19, ICE had carried out nearly 700 arrests as part of the operation, according to DHS.",
      "The new surge comes amid intense state and federal scrutiny of Minnesota following years of high-profile fraud cases involving federally funded programs. They have included some of the largest pandemic-era and post-pandemic fraud schemes in the country, like the Feeding Our Future case, which led to dozens of indictments and convictions.",
      "Federal prosecutors have charged more than 90 people in Minnesota-based fraud cases since 2021, with more than 60 convictions so far, according to court records. Investigators have revealed the alleged schemes span multiple federal programs, including nutrition, housing stabilization and child care assistance, with potential losses estimated in the billions of dollars.",
      "In recent weeks, federal activity across the Minneapolis area has increased, with HSI agents canvassing businesses and ICE officers conducting arrests in and around immigrant-populated neighborhoods. That uptick in law enforcement activity has prompted protests, confrontations and widespread fear among immigrant communities \u2014 particularly within Minnesota's large Somali-American population.",
      "President Trump has regularly cited Somalia \u2014 often in incendiary terms \u2014 to justify his mass deportation campaign. Last month, Mr. Trump called people from Somalia \"garbage\" and said they \"contribute nothing.\"",
      "\"I don't want them in our country. I'll be honest with you,\" the president said. \"Their country's no good for a reason. Their country stinks.\"",
      "At the same time, Minnesota officials led by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz have pushed back on claims that the state failed to act, pointing to audits, third-party reviews, the appointment of a program-integrity director and the creation of a statewide fraud-prevention council.",
      "But Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in 2024, announced Monday that he will not seek reelection to a third term as criticism has boiled over.",
      "Two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News that the governor met with Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sunday, as the fellow Democrat considers whether or not to enter the race.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services has frozen $185 million in federal child care payments to Minnesota, citing ongoing fraud concerns. The governor and other state leaders have warned that the move, along with a heightened federal law enforcement presence, risks harming legitimate businesses and families who rely on public assistance programs.",

    "summary": "The new CDC recommendations suggest reducing the number of vaccinations all children should receive.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Centers For Disease Control and Prevention on Monday announced updated recommendations for childhood vaccines with some significant changes. The new guidelines recommend fewer shots and are likely to face pushback from many doctors and public health experts.",
      "Under the new guidelines, the CDC recommends all children be vaccinated against 11 diseases, a decrease from the 17 immunizations previously recommended.",
      "The vaccines recommended under the new guidelines include diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), Pneumococcal conjugate, polio, measles, mumps, rubella, and human papillomavirus (HPV), as well as varicella (chickenpox). (Some vaccines, such as the MMR shot for measles, mumps and rubella, protect against multiple diseases.)",
      "In a second category under the new guidelines, it's recommended that only children in high-risk categories receive immunizations for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), hepatitis A, hepatitis B, dengue, meningococcal ACWY and meningococcal B.",
      "Finally, in a third category, for children not in high-risk groups, the decision on whether to receive certain vaccines should be based on \"shared clinical decision-making\" between physicians and parents, according to the CDC. Those immunizations include COVID-19, influenza, meningococcal disease, hepatitis A, and hepatitis B.",
      "\"It's very complicated to try to figure out the risks and the benefits,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said on the \"CBS Evening News.\" \"It's so important to have a health care provider with whom you can discuss this openly and empathetically.\"",
      "He noted, \"The American Academy of Pediatrics calls today's recommendations dangerous and said they're going to continue to give their own recommendations.\"",
      "The changes follow a controversial December recommendation on when children should receive their first dose of the hepatitis B vaccine. For more than 30 years, the CDC advised that the first dose be given within 24 hours of birth. The CDC's vaccine advisory panel, which has been hand-picked by Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., voted to recommend delaying the shot until a child is 2 months old for those born to mothers who test negative for the virus.",
      "Kennedy, a longtime vaccine critic, said in a statement that Monday's announcement \"protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health.\"",
      "\"After an exhaustive review of the evidence, we are aligning the U.S. childhood vaccine schedule with international consensus while strengthening transparency and informed consent,\" he said.",
      "President Trump called the updates \"a far more reasonable schedule, where all children will only be recommended to receive vaccinations for 11 of the most serious and dangerous diseases.\" But parents could still choose to give their children other vaccinations and those will still be covered by insurance, Mr. Trump said.",
      "The assessment compared the U.S. vaccine schedule to those of 20 other developed nations and found that the U.S. is a \"global outlier\" in both the number of diseases addressed and total number of recommended doses, according to the Health and Human Services Department.",
      "The\u00a0American Academy of Pediatrics\u00a0has disputed that, saying the longstanding U.S. recommendations were based on \"robust evidence\" and are \"largely similar across developed countries,\" with some variance due to factors like disease threats, demographics and health care systems.",
      "Dr. Ronald G. Nahass, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, called Monday's announcement a \"reckless step.\"",
      "\"Making these changes amid ongoing outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases shows a disregard for the real confusion families already face,\" he said in a statement. The biggest\u00a0measles outbreak\u00a0in more than 30 years has sickened more than 2,000 people across the U.S. Most of those sickened were not vaccinated, and two children died.",
      "Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota, warned that the change in the CDC's vaccine recommendations will put children at risk.",
      "\"Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,\" Osterholm told The Associated Press.",

      "Energy industry stocks and oil prices are rising after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0and his wife in a military operation on Saturday.",
      "In Wall Street trading on Monday, shares in Chevron \u2014 the only U.S. oil company\u00a0operating in Venezuela\u00a0\u2014 jumped $7.95, or 5.1%, on the day to close at $163.85. Exxon Mobil's stock increased 2.2%, and ConocoPhillips gained 2.6%",
      "Shares in other U.S. energy sector players also rose, with oil services giants Halliburton and Schlumberger both adding more than 10%. The price of U.S. crude rose 1.4% to $58.13 per barrel, while Brent crude, the international standard, climbed 1.2% to $61.50.",
      "Oil industry players drifted up amid a broader surge in stocks on Monday, with the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average adding 549 points, or 1.2%, to close at an all-time high of 48,977. The S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite climbed 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively.",
      "After Maduro's capture, President Trump said U.S. oil companies would participate in rebuilding Venezuela's decaying energy infrastructure.",
      "Venezuela's oil sector produces 750 million to 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data. The U.S., the world's largest oil producer, produces 13.5 million barrels per day, while No. 2 Saudi Arabia pumps an estimated 10 million barrels.",
      "Yet while Venezuela's oil production has plunged in recent decades due to government mismanagement, underinvestment and the impact of U.S. sanctions, the country is sitting on proven reserves of more than 300 billion barrels \u2014 the world's largest oil patch.",
      "While experts think that significantly boosting oil production in Venezuela could cost upwards of $100 billion and take at least a decade, some Wall Street analysts foresee a potentially faster upgrade.",
      "\"Venezuela could realistically achieve production levels of 1.3\u20131.4 [million barrels per day] within two years of a political transition,\" analysts with J.P. Morgan Markets said in a report.",
      "\"U.S. companies that may become involved in Venezuela are primarily major oil firms like Chevron, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips. Chevron already has a presence in the country, while others are exploring opportunities to recover previously expropriated assets and invest in Venezuela's massive heavy crude reserves,\" J.P. Morgan added. \"There may also be interest from U.S Gulf Coast refiners seeking less costly sources of heavy oil.\"",
      "Venezuela produces thick crude with high amounts of sulfur and metal that is widely used to produce diesel, jet fuel and heating oil, among other uses.",
      "Despite Venezuela's ample oil reserves, David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at investment adviser Capital Economics, said the business case for investing in the country's weakened energy sector is questionable, pointing to the high projected costs of extracting its \"heavy\" oil reserves.",
      "\"Crucially, we already expect lower oil prices to drive a modest decline in domestic U.S. oil production into 2027, and so the broader backdrop is hardly conducive to large-scale investments in new high-cost wells in Venezuela,\" he said in a client note.",

      "Under heavy guard, former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were flown from a federal jail in Brooklyn to Manhattan on Monday morning to make their first court appearance since being captured by U.S. forces over the weekend.",
      "Surrounded by Drug Enforcement Agency agents, the shackled Maduro shuffled from the helicopter to an armored vehicle, and was then driven to a federal courthouse, where he was greeted by the New York City Police Department and protesters \u2014 on one side of the street were those cheering Maduro's downfall, and on the other were those opposing his capture and detention.",
      "Inside the courtroom, Maduro, clad in a prison jumpsuit, was initially defiant, declaring through a translator that he is a \"decent man,\" innocent of all charges.",
      "\"I am still president of my country,\" he said. Meanwhile in Caracas, Maduro's vice president and longtime confidant Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in as interim president.",
      "Both Maduro and his wife pleaded not guilty.",
      "At one point, it seemed Maduro was trying to grandstand, but U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein cut him off, like he would anyone, saying he just needed to know Maduro's identity and if he understood his rights and the charges against him.",
      "Maduro\u00a0faces four counts of narco-terrorism, conspiracy to import cocaine and weapons-related offenses. He was indicted during President Trump's first term in 2020. In a superseding indictment unsealed Saturday, federal prosecutors have accused Maduro, his wife, son and others of partnering with some of the most violent, prolific drug traffickers and narco terrorists in the world to distribute tons of cocaine to the United States for decades.",
      "Flores' attorney, Mark Donnelly, said she may have suffered an injury to her ribs during the early Saturday morning operation to capture her and Maduro. She also appeared in court on Monday with a bandage on her forehead. It's unclear if the former Venezuelan president was injured, but his attorney,\u00a0Barry Pollack, told the court he has health issues that will require attention.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced Monday that he won't seek reelection, a surprise exit from politics less than 18 months after the Democrat was chosen to be the party's nominee for vice president.",
      "Walz was seeking an unprecedented third straight term as Minnesota's governor. But the 180 came amid intense scrutiny over fraud schemes in the North Star State, which has seen a resurgence in recent weeks.",
      "While Walz is not implicated in the fraud issues, the reality that the schemes have become an urgent problem under his watch has enveloped talk of the Minnesotan governor's future political ambitions.",
      "From VP pick to ending his reelection bid",
      "Walz, a former high school social studies teacher, coach and congressman who served in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guards, vaulted into the national political scene during the summer of 2024 as Democratic President Joe Biden faced questions about whether he should stay in the presidential race following a disastrous debate performance.",
      "After Biden dropped out of the race and former Vice President Kamala Harris was tapped to lead the ticket, Harris turned to Walz as her pick for vice president, opting for the former football coach from a blue state over contenders from more traditional presidential battlegrounds.",
      "Democrats rallied around Harris and Walz, and the Minnesota governor's stripped-back, folksy style \u2014 like describing Republican candidates as \"weird\" \u2014 seemed to add to the ticket's appeal. But a lackluster performance during that fall's vice presidential debate did little to help the party avoid stinging losses in November 2024.",
      "In the wake of that loss, Walz held nationally-focused town halls in several states while also being seen as a potential candidate for the 2028 presidential election. Last year, he announced he would run for a third term as governor.",
      "An uproar over Minnesota fraud",
      "Walz's name came back into the national spotlight in recent months, amid uproar over a series of multimillion-dollar pandemic fraud schemes in Minnesota. Though Walz isn't implicated in the scheme, he's served as the state's governor since 2019, and his administration has faced years of local scrutiny over their handling of fraud.",
      "During the Biden administration in 2022, federal prosecutors in Minnesota filed charges in what they described as the \"largest pandemic fraud in the United States,\" which revolved around a welfare program that partnered with the Minnesota Department of Education and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to distribute meals to children. Republican officials have argued for years that Minnesota was slow to act in the scheme, and failed to carry out due diligence. But the issue saw a resurgence late last year.",
      "The criticism over Minnesota fraud rose to the top GOP ranks, and President Trump directed his ire over the issue at Walz, including with a post on Truth Social on Thanksgiving where he used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe the Minnesota governor. And the Treasury Department said last month that it would investigate whether tax dollars from Minnesota's public assistance programs made their way to the al Qaeda affiliate al Shabaab, which is based in Somalia. Meanwhile, House Republicans on the Oversight Committee launched an investigation into Walz's handling of the fraud cases.",
      "Walz: \"I can't give a political campaign my all\"",
      "Scrutiny over the fraud scandal hasn't died down in recent weeks. And in his statement announcing an end to his gubernatorial bid, Walz cited the scheme.",
      "Walz acknowledged that in recent years, \"an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity,\" adding that \"even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\"",
      "\"I won't mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies \u2013 in Washington, in St. Paul, and online \u2013 want to make our state a colder, meaner place,\" Walz said. \"They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.\"",
      "Walz outlined his administration's effort to combat fraud, saying \"across the state, Minnesotans are hard at work on this problem.\" But he said there's \"more to do,\" and \"the buck stops with me.\"",
      "The second-term governor said while he announced a reelection bid in September, he's come to the conclusion in recent weeks that \"I can't give a political campaign my all,\" specifically citing the fraud scandal.",
      "\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" Walz said. \"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"",
      "In a statement on Walz's decision, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the No. 3 House Republican, simply said, \"Good riddance.\"",

    "story": [
      "A trader made more than $436,000 on a prediction market by appearing to anticipate former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's capture\u00a0by U.S. forces last weekend, raising questions about the timing of the bet and the integrity of such online futures trading platforms.",
      "An anonymous user on Polymarket won the payout after\u00a0placing\u00a0a roughly $32,000 wager on Maduro's removal \u2014 just before President Trump announced the U.S. had ousted the former leader.",
      "The longshot wager raises questions about the anonymous bettor's identity and potential access to inside information ahead of the U.S. operation to seize Maduro and his wife, legal and financial experts told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket, a New York-based cryptocurrency prediction market that recently secured a $2 billion investment from stock exchange operator Intercontinental Exchange, is currently pursuing regulatory approval in the U.S.",
      "Suspicious timing?",
      "A Polymarket account holder, who appeared to join the trading platform in December, bet $32,537 on the likelihood that Maduro would be \"out by January 31, 2026.\" The speculative investment was placed shortly before Mr. Trump announced Maduro's arrest at 4:21 a.m. Saturday on Truth Social.",
      "Experts said several indicators suggest the bettor could have had access to classified information regarding the U.S. operation to capture Maduro.",
      "\"It clearly suggests that the bettor did have access to inside information,\" said Dennis Kelleher, cofounder and CEO of Better Markets, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on financial reform. \"This particular bet has all the hallmarks of a trade based on inside information. It happened very late, right before the very event they were betting on happened; it was a relatively large amount of money; and it happened in a market that is not really regulated and where there is no transparency.\"",
      "Three additional bets were made via the same Polymarket account: a $1,000 wager on the U.S. invading Venezuela by January 31; a $250 wager that Mr. Trump would invoke the War Powers Act against Venezuela by January 31; and a $146 wager that U.S. forces would land in Venezuela by the end of the month.",
      "\"It was a new account only betting on issues around the Venezuelan president's potential removal from office \u2014 there are a lot of telltale signs that make it seem like insider trading,\" Stephen Piepgrass, a regulatory attorney at Troutman Pepper Locke who specializes in futures trading, told CBS News.",
      "Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment on the Maduro-related bets. Last fall, company CEO Shayne Coplan told CBS News that insiders \"having an edge to the market is a good thing.\"",
      "\"Obviously, you need to curate them and you need to be really clear and stringent on where the line is drawn and, like, sort of ethics, and we spend a lot of time on that. But it's sort of an inevitability that this will happen, and there's a lot of benefits from it. And, you know, people will adapt,\" he told 60 Minutes' Anderson Cooper.",
      "Uneven playing field?",
      "The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is the government agency tasked with regulating prediction markets such as Polymarket and Kalshi, another online betting platform that lets consumers bet on a range of news, sports and other events.",
      "But Kelleher contends that the commission's oversight of prediction markets is weak.",
      "\"These kinds of gambling markets are almost entirely unregulated. The CFTC is supposed to regulate, but it doesn't have the money, personnel or expertise to do it,\" he said. \"This isn't a case of light-touch regulation \u2014 it's a case of no-touch regulation.\"",
      "The CFTC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "story": [
      "Following last weekend's capture of\u00a0Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, President Trump said that American oil companies would play a key role in reviving the country's\u00a0languishing oil industry.",
      "That could be easier said than done. Persuading U.S. energy players to return to Venezuela will require the Caracas government to reassert political stability in a country racked by years of political turmoil, experts told CBS News.",
      "Meanwhile, risk-averse American companies are unlikely to invest the billions of dollars required to upgrade Venezuela's creaking oil infrastructure until they have more clarity on the legal and fiscal landscape following Maduro's removal.",
      "Shaky ground",
      "\"Companies will need a stable physical environment, which is highly uncertain at this point,\" David Goldwyn, president of Goldwyn Global Strategies, an international energy advisory consultancy, and also the chairman of the energy advisory group at the nonpartisan Atlantic Council, told CBS News in an email.",
      "U.S. energy companies will wait to see what financial and contractual terms they receive from the Venezuelan government to re-enter the country, as well as how the commercial opportunities stack up in Venezuela compared with other investments worldwide, Goldwyn said.",
      "Although Chevron already operates in Venezuela, oil companies including\u00a0Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips\u00a0no longer have a presence in the country after former President Hugo Chavez effectively ejected them by nationalizing their assets in 2007.",
      "As a result, it would take new entrants to the Venezuelan market several years to build out their operations, requiring long-term\u00a0 \u2014 and thus riskier \u2014 calculations about the cost of production and oil prices, Goldwyn said.",
      "Any U.S. investment would also require establishing a new contractual agreement with Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil and gas company, according to a J.P. Morgan Markets analysis.",
      "\"U.S. companies could happily work with the national oil company, but they prefer to control their own operations, so a majority stake would be preferable,\" Goldwyn added.",
      "Meanwhile, thorny legal issues would likely need to be resolved over outstanding compensation claims by Exxon and ConocoPhillips stemming from Chavez effectively tearing up their contracts, J.P. Morgan analysts Natasha Kaneva and Lyuba Savinova said in a report.",
      "$100 billion gamble?",
      "Perhaps most daunting is the sheer level of investment required to modernize Venezuela's oil infrastructure \u2014 an effort that could take a decade and cost up to $100 billion, said Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University.",
      "According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), Venezuela's aging pipelines for transporting oil from wells to refineries haven't been upgraded in roughly 50 years. As of 2023, that network consisted of 25 operational pipelines and is prone to daily spills, the agency notes.",
      "\"Investment terms \u2014 including confidence they will endure \u2014 and the oil price environment need to be conducive to such investments,\" energy analysts with S&P Global said in a report.",
      "Venezuela now accounts for 0.8% of global oil output, ranking it No. 18 among the world's oil producers, according to Capital Economics. Yet it accounts for roughly 9% of the worldwide market for \"heavy\" crude oil, which is used to make diesel, jet fuel, home heating oil and other purposes.",
      "A spokesperson for Chevron, which operates in Venezuela under a special U.S. license, declined to comment on whether the company has any plans to scale up production in the country following Maduro's removal.",
      "\"Chevron remains focused on the safety and well-being of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets,\" the spokesperson told CBS News in an email. \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.\"",
      "A ConocoPhillips spokesperson said the company is monitoring developments in Venezuela, adding that it would be \"premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" Exxon did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and Exxon are planning to meet with Trump administration officials later this week to discuss the situation in Venezuela, CBS News has confirmed.",
      "Shares of the three companies\u00a0rose on Wall Street Monday, a sign investors see upside for Big Oil following the developments in Venezuela.",
      "Other U.S. energy companies could still benefit even without injecting capital into on-the-ground facilities in Venezuela, Monaldi said. For example, U.S. refineries like Texas-based Valero could gain access to a huge, geographically proximate source of the heavy crude they require to produce different fuels.",

      "In 2025, United States recorded the most measles cases in more than 30 years, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data shows. A large share of the infections were connected to an outbreak in West Texas that led to\u00a0the deaths\u00a0of two children.",
      "The total number of cases nationwide topped 2.000 by the end of the year, with infections confirmed in at least 44 states.",
      "Measles is one of the most contagious infectious diseases, and in some cases, can cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that can lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death. But doctors and health officials say the vaccine, which is normally given as part of the combination measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, is\u00a0highly safe and effective.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "The largest outbreak so far this year has been in West Texas, with over\u00a0760\u00a0confirmed infections before the state declared the outbreak\u00a0officially over\u00a0in August. A growing number of cases have also been reported in other states around the country. In South Carolina, for example,\u00a0dozens of students were quarantined in October due to an outbreak.",
      "The CBS News data team is tracking confirmed measles cases nationwide as new data is released by state health departments and the CDC. (The map below is updated on Wednesdays when the CDC releases its latest weekly numbers.)",
      "The Texas outbreak primarily affected\u00a0children and teenagers, nearly all of whom were\u00a0unvaccinated\u00a0or had an unknown vaccination status. State and local health officials confirmed the first patient who died was an unvaccinated school-aged child, and the second was an unvaccinated 8-year-old girl. Neither of the children had underlying health conditions, the Texas health department said. New Mexico also reported the death of an adult with measles.",
      "The last measles death in the U.S. before this year was in 2019, when a 37-year-old man died from measles complicated by meningitis in California, according to CDC data.",
      "Until now, the highest number of confirmed cases in the U.S. in recent years was 1,274 in 2019, driven by outbreaks in New York, California and Washington state, but most years the total has been much lower.",
      "Health experts point to lower vaccination rates as a reason for increases in preventable diseases like the measles.",
      "CDC data shows about 93% of kindergarteners in the U.S. were vaccinated against measles during the 2021-2022 school year and only 92.7% in the 2023-2024 school year. This is\u00a0down from 95.2% during the 2019-2020 school year \u2014 a critical threshold to keep people safe.",

      "\"We encourage people to get the measles vaccine,\" Kennedy told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook in an interview\u00a0in April, marking the first time Kennedy has publicly urged people to get the measles vaccine since becoming HHS secretary.",

      "Washington\u00a0\u2014 American forces plan to intercept an evading oil tanker that has historically carried Venezuelan crude oil and was sanctioned by the Treasury Department, according to two U.S. officials with knowledge of the plans.",
      "Since last month, U.S. forces have pursued the Marinera, a crude oil tanker formerly known as the Bella 1, as the U.S. continues its pressure campaign against Venezuela. Since September, the United States has steadily turned the screws, accusing former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government of using multiple vessels to move drugs north toward American shores.",
      "Two U.S. intelligence officials also said Venezuelan officials had discussed placing armed military personnel on tankers \u2014 disguising them as civilians for defense purposes \u2014 as well as portable Soviet-era air defense systems. The discussions took place before the capture of Maduro and his wife by U.S. special forces on Friday and into the early hours of Saturday morning, the officials told CBS News.",
      "The two officials familiar with the Marinera seizure plans said the U.S. would rather seize the ship than sink it and said the operation could be similar to the one conducted last month when U.S. Marines and special operation forces working with the U.S. Coast Guard seized The Skipper, a large crude oil tanker flagged out of Guyana, after the vessel had left port in Venezuela.",
      "The Coast Guard tried to board the tanker last month, after the Justice Department obtained a seizure warrant based on the ship's prior involvement in the Iranian oil trade, a U.S. official previously said.",
      "Maduro has rejected the U.S. allegations about how the vessels are being used and instead accuses the United States of plundering Venezuelan resources under the cover of law enforcement. The latest confrontation is one in a series of U.S. actions that include charging Maduro and his wife with narco-terrorism. American strikes on multiple vessels have killed more than 100 people in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific.",
      "The Marinera was a ship previously flagged out of Panama and was sanctioned for its prior involvement in Iranian oil trading by the Treasury Department in 2024 under former President Joe Biden, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. But now the ship is sailing under the Russian flag, which potentially could complicate sensitive talks between the United States and Russia over ending the Kremlin's war in Ukraine.",
      "The Russian Maritime Register of Shipping lists the tanker as being ported out of Sochi, off the western coast of the Black Sea. The New York Times reported that the Russian government officially asked the U.S. to stop all attempts to interdict the ship.",
      "Contacted by CBS News on Monday, no reply was returned from the White House, Pentagon or State Department. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., also did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "The two U.S. officials with knowledge of U.S. military operational planning said the interdiction mission could come as early as this week but like any Defense Department plans, the operation could ultimately be shelved. The officials spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss national security matters.",
      "Like the Marinera, The Skipper was also sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2022 for its alleged role in an oil smuggling network that helped fund the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group backed by Iran.",
      "Ships like the Marinera, The Skipper and the Centuries, another oil tanker the United States seized last month, are all a part of a so-called shadow fleet of ships that illegally transport oil from sanctioned nations like Russia, Iran and Venezuela.",
      "President Trump unilaterally imposed a \"total and complete blockade\" on already sanctioned Venezuelan oil tankers on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Venezuela is completely surrounded by the largest Armada ever assembled in the History of South America,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"It will only get bigger, and the shock to them will be like nothing they have ever seen before \u2014 Until such time as they return to the United States of America all of the Oil, Land, and other Assets that they previously stole from us.\"",
      "On Monday, The New York Times reported that at least 16 oil tankers have attempted to evade the U.S. naval blockade by disguising their geographical locations or turning off their transmission beacons.",
      "If the Marinera is captured by American forces, it would be the third oil tanker seized by the United States since it began its campaign against Venezuela in early September.",

Now, the 92-year-old senior judge in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York adds former President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro to his roster of prominent, famed and infamous defendants \u2014 but he's not the first former head of state to come before Hellerstein's court.",
      "Hellerstein has repeatedly rejected efforts by President Trump to remove his New York State criminal case to federal court, penning withering criticisms of Mr. Trump's arguments that the facts at the heart of his \"hush money\" case warranted official acts conducted during his first presidency. Mr. Trump was found guilty by a state jury in that case, which revolved around reimbursements made to a former Trump attorney, Michael Cohen, for a payment just before the 2016 presidential election to adult film star Stephanie Clifford, whose stage name is Stormy Daniels.",
      "\"Reimbursing Cohen for advancing hush money to Stephanie Clifford cannot be considered the performance of a constitutional duty,\" Hellerstein wrote. \"Falsifying business records to hide such reimbursement, and to transform the reimbursement into a business expense for Trump and income to Cohen, likewise does not relate to a presidential duty.\"",
      "But a 2024 ruling by the Supreme Court has forced Hellerstein to reconsider that determination. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered Hellerstein to reexamine arguments around presidential immunity, factoring the Supreme Court's landmark decision that upended multiple Trump cases.",
      "Hellerstein was also the judge assigned to preside over an American Civil Liberties Union effort that challenged the deportation of two Venezuelans last year. Hellerstein granted a temporary restraining order protecting deportees in the Southern District of New York from being removed prior to receiving due process. The case was filed on behalf of two Venezuelans\u00a0challenging the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport alleged gang members.",
      "The no-nonsense judge also recently presided over the 2025 trial of Charlie Javice, who was convicted of defrauding JPMorgan Chase out of $175 million by lying about the size of her company's customer base. That company, Frank, claimed to revolutionize the way college students applied for financial aid.",
      "Hellerstein has presided over matters tied to the Maduro case since 2014 when he was assigned to a related case. He oversaw a superseding indictment naming Maduro in 2020. Monday's hearing was, of course, the first time the lead defendant has appeared in Hellerstein's court.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended American military actions in Venezuela during an emergency meeting at the United Nations on Monday, and argued that there is no regime change nor U.S. occupation. He repeated the Trump administration's argument that the air and ground assault was not an attack but rather military force used as a tool to assist a law enforcement operation.",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio has said, there is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,\" Waltz said, according to the readout. \"This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades. The United States arrested a narcotrafficker who is now going to stand trial in the United States in accordance with the rule of law for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years.\"",
      "\"This is not regime change this is justice,\" Waltz wrote in a social media post on Saturday.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he is \"deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela,\" saying it has \"potential worrying implications for the region.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law,\" the statement said.",
      "France's foreign minister has already condemned the operation as violating international law, although President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he \"neither supported nor approved\" the operation, according to France 24.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Margaret Brennan on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters\" when pressed as to whether the U.S. had ruled out an occupation of Venezuela. Rubio argued that President Trump would not explicitly rule out anything and maintained the power to invoke military force if there are imminent threats. He emphasized that economic pressure was the main tool being used on the remaining indicted regime members who currently run the country.",
      "As noted by Brennan, other officials in Maduro's government who are still in power in Venezuela, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who have also been indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and have multi-million dollar U.S. government bounties on their heads. Rubio argued Sunday that it was not feasible to arrest four individuals in five different locations in a single complex raid and that there would have been outcry if the U.S. attempted to do so.",
      "\"Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority,\" Rubio said.",
      "As for the Trump administration's ability to control the current regime, Rubio emphasized that the main pressure remains cutting off their financial lifelines.",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",

    "story": [
      "Former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, appeared in federal court in lower Manhattan on Monday for their arraignment on charges related to drug trafficking. They were brought to the U.S. on Saturday after being captured by U.S. forces in an attack that President Trump described as \"a large-scale strike against Venezuela and its leader,\" following months of military buildup.",
      "Charges include narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine and narcotics importation/exportation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices, among others. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a 92-year-old who has been on the bench since 1998, is presiding over the case.",
      "Maduro and Flores pleaded not guilty to all charges. Maduro faces four counts, and Flores has been charged with three offenses. Four others are named in the indictment as co-defendants, including Maduro's son and Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Here is what to know about the lawyers for Maduro and Flores, and the prosecutors working on the case:",
      "Maduro is represented by Barry Pollack",
      "Maduro is represented by D.C.-based attorney Barry Pollack. Pollack is a seasoned trial lawyer who represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and a former in-house accountant for Enron. Pollack appeared in court alongside Maduro for the arraignment.",
      "Pollack works for the firm Harris St. Laurent & Wechsler LLP. He helped broker the plea deal that saw Assange plead guilty in 2024 to a single felony count for publishing U.S. military secrets.",
      "According to his firm, Pollack obtained a complete acquittal of the former Enron Corp. executive, Michael Krautz, on criminal fraud charges. This was one of only two cases that resulted in acquittals in the numerous prosecutions arising out of the collapse of Enron.",
      "His practice areas include cases involving public corruption and national security.",
      "Flores is represented by Mark Donnelly",
      "Mark Donnelly, a lawyer based in Houston, is representing Cilia Flores, according to a court filing.",
      "Donnelly, who works for the firm Parker Sanchez & Donnelly, is licensed to practice in Texas. He worked for 12 years at the Justice Department, including as senior adviser to the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas. There, he led the office's fraud division, according to a biography from his firm.",
      "Donnelly also was a prosecutor with the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Texas for eight years. There, he worked with the public integrity section and led investigations into elected officials.",
      "His firm lists his areas of specialty as white collar criminal defense, business litigation, real estate litigation and whistleblower actions.",
      "Donnelly is a proficient Spanish speaker, according to his law firm.",
      "\"Our client is in good spirits. We look forward to reviewing and challenging the evidence the government has,\" Flores' lawyers said in a statement. \"While we would love to present our side now, we will wait to do so in court at the appropriate time. The first lady is aware that there is a long road ahead and is prepared.\"",
      "The United States Attorney's Office prosecuting the case",
      "The U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of New York is handling the prosecution for this case. The office is led by Jay Clayton and covers matters from Manhattan to the Bronx, as well as counties north of New York City.",
      "Clayton, the top federal prosecutor for the region, signed the indictment against Maduro and his wife. He began serving as interim U.S. attorney in April, and in August, the judges on the U.S. district court voted to allow him to continue serving in the role. He will remain U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York unless the Senate confirms or Mr. Trump selects another candidate to replace him.",
      "Clayton served as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission during the first Trump administration. He was a partner at the firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP before joining the SEC, and returned there after his tenure at the commission ended in December 2020.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi tapped Clayton in November to lead an investigation into convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's involvement with prominent Democrats and major financial institutions.",
      "Amanda Houle, who is listed as one of the lead attorneys in the Maduro case, is the chief of the criminal division for the office. She returned to the U.S. Attorney's Office from private practice.",
      "From 2015 to 2023, Houle worked in the Southern District of New York, including as chief of the Narcotics Unit and chief of the National Security and International Narcotics Unit, according to the Department of Justice.",
      "Kyle Wirshba is also an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Wirshba has been with the office for more than eight years, according to Linkedin.",
      "In 2020, Wirshba prosecuted a case against a former member of the Venezuelan National Assembly, who was charged with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking and weapons offenses. According to the Department of Justice, Adel El Zabayar allegedly worked with Maduro to distribute cocaine and weapons in coordination with terrorist organizations.",
      "Michael Lockard is part of the U.S. Attorney's Office of National Security and International Narcotics Unit. Lockard has handled cases involving the governments of Iran and China.",
      "In one 2025 case that Lockard helped prosecute, two Eastern European organized crime leaders were convicted of \"murder-for hire,\" which targeted a U.S.-based journalist, according to the Department of Justice.",

He's also worked on other high-profile drug trafficking cases, including matters stemming from a 2011 indictment of more than five dozen gang members based in Yonkers, New York.",
      "Court records show Bradley filing frequently for judicial permission allowing investigators to use pen registers, devices or processes that trace phone calls and other transmissions from specific phones or computers.

      "The starting dose of the daily Wegovy pill, at 1.5 milligrams, is now available for $149 per month for self-paying patients,\u00a0Novo Nordisk announced on Monday. A 4 mg dose of the medication is available for the same price through April 15, after which the cost will rise to $199.",

      "The Novo Nordisk pill contains 25 milligrams of semaglutide, the same ingredient in injectables Wegovy and Ozempic. It also has similar side effects as the injectable version of the medication, including nausea and diarrhea, according to Novo Nordisk.",
      "The new Wegovy pill provides Americans an alternative, and more convenient, option than injectable treatments, which have dominated the weight-loss market since they were introduced. Roughly 1 in 8 Americans has used an injectable GLP-1 drug for weight loss or another condition, according to a recent\u00a0survey\u00a0from nonprofit group KFF.",

    "summary": "Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Lawmakers return to Washington this week, staring down an end-of-month deadline to avert another government shutdown. The next funding fight comes fresh off a revolt from moderate Republicans over rising health care costs, and as the conflict with Venezuela and frustration with the Justice Department's handling of the rollout of the Epstein files come to a head.",
      "Funding the government is at the top of Congress' to-do list after a bruising 43-day shutdown that stretched from October through the first half of November. To end the longest shutdown in history, lawmakers approved a measure to fund parts of the government through the end of the fiscal year in September. Funding for the vast majority of agencies and programs, however, was temporarily extended until Jan. 30.",
      "Congress risks a partial shutdown if it does not approve new funding or another short-term patch for the remaining portions of the government before the end of the month. And it has to balance that priority alongside other legislative battles.",
      "Funding the government",
      "Sen. Susan Collins of Maine and Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, the top GOP appropriators in the Senate and House, announced an agreement on top-line spending for the remaining nine funding bills just before Christmas.",
      "\"This pathway forward aligns with President Trump's clear direction to rein in runaway, beltway-driven spending,\" Cole said in a statement, noting that the total funding falls below the current levels. \"We will now begin expeditiously drafting the remaining nine full-year bills to ensure we are ready to complete our work in January.\"",
      "House and Senate negotiators released the text of an initial package of three bills on Monday, known as a \"minibus.\" The legislation would provide funding related to science and the Departments of Commerce and Justice; energy and water development; and the Department of Interior and the EPA.",
      "Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that \"passing these bills will help ensure that Congress, not President Trump and Russ Vought, decides how taxpayer dollars are spent-by once again providing hundreds of detailed spending directives and reasserting congressional control over these incredibly important spending decisions.\"",
      "The progress inches Congress one step closer to avoiding a shutdown, though potential roadblocks remain. Buy-in from Democrats is necessary in the Senate for passage and may be needed in the House if conservatives withhold their support \u2014 a move they regularly threaten with funding bills.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, is also facing a dwindling majority. GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is vacating her seat on Monday, retiring a year before her term ends after a bitter feud with President Trump. Her departure will leave Johnson with a two-vote margin.",
      "After weeks of debate among Senate Republicans, the upper chamber had hoped to move forward with another \"minibus\" ahead of the winter recess, but two Democratic senators stood in the way.",
      "Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper of Colorado held up the package to object to the Trump administration's dismantling of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, which is located in Boulder. The senators pledged to use \"every lever available to do what is right for Colorado.\" The duo may be even less inclined to allow the funding bills to move forward after Mr. Trump vetoed a bipartisan bill designed to make it easier to build a water pipeline in Colorado.",
      "Should the process to pass the long-term measures stall, leaders could opt to pursue another short-term continuing resolution and again punt the funding issue down the line.",
      "Still, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week\" Sunday that Congress isn't headed toward a shutdown at the end of the month. He said Democrats want to work on a bipartisan, bicameral basis to fund the government through September, and \"the good news is our Republican appropriators are working with us and we're making good progress in that regard.\"",
      "Health care",
      "Democrats' demand to extend the Affordable Care Act's enhanced premium tax credits was at the center of last year's shutdown. Their effort to extend the tax credits as part of the agreement to reopen the government fell short and the subsidies expired last week, raising premiums for millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the exchanges.",
      "But the fight isn't over yet.",
      "After a vote on a Democratic measure to extend the tax credits for three years without reforms fell short in the Senate, four moderate House Republicans joined all Democrats to back a discharge petition to force a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "The moderates had criticized a straight extension without any reforms such as income caps, but argued that Democrats' proposal to extend the tax credits without any changes was better than allowing them to expire.",
      "The House is expected to vote on the motion to discharge the bill for a vote in the coming days. Johnson said it was \"inevitable\" that it would be considered on the floor when lawmakers returned after the holidays.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, a New York Democrat, said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that \"we've got to make sure that a straightforward extension of the Affordable Care Act tax credits passes out of the House upon our return next week so we can protect the health care of tens of millions of Americans who are about to experience dramatically increased health insurance premiums, copays and deductibles.\"",
      "\"That's completely and totally unacceptable, and Republicans have a responsibility to partner with us as Democrats to stop it,\" Jeffries added.",
      "Ahead of the winter break, the discharge petition seemed to add momentum to a bipartisan effort to reach a health care compromise. A number of moderate Democrats and Republicans in both chambers have been seeking a solution on health care costs, and were expected to continue their conversations over the holidays. The discharge petition could serve as a vehicle for an extension of the tax credits with some reforms, should the lawmakers reach a compromise.",
      "Lawmakers to apply pressure on Epstein files release",
      "Congress' return is also expected to be marked by new pressure on the Justice Department over its piecemeal approach to releasing the files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The Epstein Files Transparency Act \u2014 which Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed into law in November \u2014 dictated that the Justice Department release the files by Dec. 19. However, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the Justice Department will release them on a rolling basis due to the volume of materials and the need to redact some information.",
      "Rep. Ro Khanna, a California Democrat, and Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, spearheaded the legislation and the effort to force a vote on the issue. They have both criticized the Justice Department's handling of the release.",
      "So far, the Justice Department has released thousands of documents that are believed to represent only a small fraction of the Epstein files. The first release came on Dec. 19, followed by the release of additional materials a day later, along with a massive tranche of files on Dec. 23. The Justice Department also said on Dec. 24 that \"over a million more documents potentially related to the Jeffrey Epstein case\" had been uncovered, adding that the process of releasing the files may take \"a few more weeks.\"",
      "Khanna and Massie said last month that they are drafting a resolution to hold Attorney General Pam Bondi in \"inherent contempt\" of Congress over the release of the files. The lawmakers said they were building support for the resolution, which would likely be offered as a privileged motion, requiring leadership to schedule a vote within two legislative days.",
      "Schumer also announced last month that he had introduced a resolution that would direct the upper chamber to \"initiate legal actions\" against the Justice Department to demand that it comply with the law. The New York Democrat is expected to force a vote on the measure when the Senate reconvenes this week.",
      "A group of senators, including one Republican, has also requested that the Justice Department's inspector general conduct an audit of the department's compliance with the new law. The senators said the investigation is \"essential\" given the Trump administration's \"historic hostility to releasing the files\" and \"politicization of the Epstein case more broadly.\"",
      "Conflict with Venezuela",
      "Another war powers vote is also on the horizon after Mr. Trump announced early Saturday that the U.S. had carried out a \"large scale strike against Venezuela\" and captured President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife. Mr. Trump also said the U.S. will \"run the country\" and threatened a \"much larger attack\" if needed. The development marks a major escalation in the monthslong military campaign against the South American nation.",
      "Congress has not authorized military force against Venezuela, and the Trump administration did not notify lawmakers of the plan ahead of time.",
      "Most Democrats and a few Republicans have sought to limit Mr. Trump's authority to strike Venezuela and suspected drug-trafficking boats in the region as the U.S. leader says the South American country's role in drug smuggling poses a threat to national security. But the Senate and House have each failed twice to limit Mr. Trump's authority to continue the military campaign.",
      "Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia said the Senate will vote this week on his latest war powers resolution. He introduced the measure in early December, days after the revelation that the U.S. killed two people who survived the initial blast of a Sept. 2 strike in the Caribbean Sea.",
      "Kaine's measure would require \"the removal of United States Armed Forces from hostilities within or against Venezuela that have not been authorized by Congress.\"",
      "In a call with reporters on Saturday he called the military action in Venezuela \"an illegal war.\"",
      "\"There is no legal justification in the Constitution, in the history of the Constitution, or an American law that would authorize the president to wage war, to depose President Maduro and seize its oil and run the country of Venezuela without coming to Congress,\" Kaine said. \"It's time for Congress to get its ass off the couch and do what the Constitution mandates that we do.\"",
      "Besides the war powers resolution, Kaine said he's also looking at the defense appropriations process as a mechanism to prohibit military action in Venezuela.",
      "Before they left for the year, House Democrats forced votes on two war powers resolutions as Mr. Trump warned that land strikes against Venezuela could commence \"soon.\" Since then, the U.S. carried out several more boat strikes and, according to Mr. Trump, \"knocked out\" a \"big facility\" linked to the alleged drug smuggling operations.",

    "summary": "An indictment charging Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro with drug trafficking was unsealed Saturday.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was indicted by a federal grand jury on charges stemming from what prosecutors said was his role in a scheme to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine into the United States and enrich himself, his family and senior members of the Venezuelan government.",
      "The indictment was unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi after Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were taken into military custody in an overnight operation and brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges. \"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Maduro, Flores and four others are named as defendants in the indictment, including Maduro's son, Nicol\u00e1s Ernesto Maduro; Venezuela's interior minister, Diosdado Cabello; its former interior minister, Ram\u00f3n Rodr\u00edguez Chac\u00edn; and a leader of the gang Tren de Aragua, Hector Rusthenford Guerrero Flores.",
      "It's unclear whether the U.S. has arrested Maduro's son. The other three defendants were not taken into custody.",
      "Maduro and Flores could appear in court in Manhattan as early as Monday, two sources familiar with the matter told CBS News. The case against them was brought in the Southern District of New York, where Maduro and 14 others were first indicted in March 2020, during the first Trump administration. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein is overseeing the case.",
      "The plane carrying Maduro landed at an airport in the Hudson Valley on Saturday afternoon. The Venezuelan leader was expected to be turned over to federal authorities and arraigned at the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York next week, two sources told CBS News.",
      "Secured by U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, the superseding indictment alleges that for more than 25 years, \"leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.\"",
      "Prosecutors place Maduro at the \"forefront of the corruption,\" and say that he and his associates worked with drug traffickers and narco-terrorists to flood the U.S. with \"thousands of tons of cocaine.\" This drug trafficking, according to the indictment, enriched Maduro, his family and members of Venezuela's political and military elite.",
      "\"This cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect and transport tons of cocaine into the United States,\" the indictment states.",
      "Maduro faces four charges: narco-terrorism conspiracy; cocaine importation conspiracy; possession of machineguns and destructive devices; and conspiracy to possess machineguns and destructive devices.",
      "\"Maduro and his wife will soon face the full might of American justice and stand trial on American soil,\" President Trump said in a press conference from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, earlier Saturday.",
      "The indictment alleges that Maduro has used his various positions in the Venezuelan government to transport cocaine. Prosecutors said that as minister of foreign affairs, Maduro sold diplomatic passports to known drug traffickers to help them move drug proceeds from Mexico back to Venezuela under diplomatic cover and facilitated the movement of private planes under diplomatic cover to evade law enforcement scrutiny.",
      "Maduro and his wife also allegedly worked together between 2004 and 2015, with the help of military escorts, to traffic cocaine seized by Venezuelan law enforcement. Prosecutors said the two maintained their own groups of state-sponsored gangs to facilitate and protect their drug-trafficking operation. They are accused of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders against people who owed them money or who undermined their drug-trafficking operation.",
      "Prosecutors said that after Maduro became president in 2013, he and others authorized the arrest of certain Venezuelan military officials to divert scrutiny away from them after French authorities seized 1.3 tons of cocaine that had been dispatched on a commercial flight from Venezuela to Paris.",
      "Maduro's wife is accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to broker a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the head of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, according to the indictment. The trafficker then arranged to pay a monthly bribe to Reverol Torres to ship cocaine, and Flores received a portion of it, prosecutors said.",
      "Reverol Torres was charged with narcotics offenses in 2015 and is a fugitive.",

      "Geneva \u2014 Fire safety inspections hadn't been carried out for several years at the bar where a fire that broke out at a New Year's party left 40 people dead and over 100 injured, local authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Investigators have said they believe festive sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire at Le Constellation in the resort town of Crans-Montana when they came too close to the ceiling. Authorities are looking into whether soundproofing material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar.",
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar managers. The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, according to the Valais region's chief prosecutor.",
      "Regional authorities have said that safety inspections are the responsibility of the municipality. On Tuesday, the Crans-Montana municipality said inspections of Le Constellation that included fire safety checks had been carried out in 2016, 2018 and 2019, and that modifications had been requested - but no issues with soundproofing measures had been raised.",
      "The local council discovered after consulting documents after the fire that \"periodic checks were not carried out between 2020 and 2025,\" the head of Crans-Montana's municipal government, Nicolas F\u00e9raud, told a news conference.",
      "\"We regret this bitterly,\" he said, adding that it will be up to judicial authorities to determine what influence that may have had on the chain of events that led to the fire. \"We owe it to the families, and we will accept responsibility,\" F\u00e9raud\u00a0 said.",
      "\"This tragedy has brought a sentiment of uncertainty all across the region. We're now putting everything in order to reassure\" people, he said.",
      "F\u00e9raud said he couldn't immediately explain why safety inspections hadn't been conducted for such a long time.",
      "He said that in September last year, an external expert had been asked to carry out a soundproofing analysis and had concluded that the bar complied with anti-noise rules, without making further remarks.",
      "The severity of burns made it difficult to identify some victims of the fire that broke out at about 1:30 a.m. on New Year's Day, requiring families to supply authorities with DNA samples.",
      "Investigators finished identifying the 40 dead on Sunday and said on Monday that they had identified all 116 people who were injured.",
      "F\u00e9raud said reports from the inspections that were carried out mentioned a maximum capacity of 100 people on the bar's ground floor and 100 in its basement. It's unclear how many people were in Le Constellation when the blaze broke out and investigators have said that may never be known.",
      "The municipality said the bar's owner obtained a permit to build a veranda in 2015 and also carried out interior work at the bar that did not require a permit.",
      "It said it has now decided to ban the use of fireworks indoors and to commission an external agency to carry out inspections of such establishments.",

      "Mr. Trump has hinted at possible elections in Venezuela further down the road. Some, including Republican Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, believe that Machado could win over Venezuelans.

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth revealed new details Monday about the U.S. operation to capture and arrest Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, describing a meticulously planned raid that caught the Venezuelan leader completely off guard.",
      "Speaking to sailors aboard the USS John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier in Newport News, Virginia, Hegseth said Maduro had no warning the U.S. was closing in until moments before American forces arrived.",
      "\"Nicol\u00e1s Maduro got to meet some great Americans wearing night vision goggles three nights ago,\" Hegseth said. \"He didn't know they were coming until three minutes before they arrived. In fact, his wife said, 'I think I hear aircraft outside.' They didn't know. You know why? Because every single part of that chain did their job.\"",
      "Roughly 200 Americans carried out the overnight raid Saturday at Maduro's residence in downtown Caracas, Hegseth said. Fighter jets and bombers struck Venezuelan air defenses, clearing the way for Delta Force commandos to close in on the compound, where they came under heavy fire.",
      "\"They got off the helicopter, and the bullets were flying all over the place,\" President Trump told reporters Sunday aboard Air Force One. \"As you know, one of the helicopters got hit pretty badly, but we got everything back.\"",
      "Several U.S. soldiers were injured in the operation, according to U.S. officials. Dozens of Venezuelans were killed, along with 32 Cuban citizens who were part of Maduro's security detail, Cuba's government said.",
      "\"There was a lot of death on the other side, unfortunately. But a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday trying to protect him,\" Trump said.",
      "Once U.S. forces breached the compound, they intercepted Maduro before he could reach a safe room, officials said. The raid had been rehearsed for months using a replica of Maduro's residence to prepare for multiple scenarios.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the operation was built around repetition and redundancy.",
      "\"We think, we develop, we train, we rehearse, we debrief, we rehearse again and again, not to get it right, but to ensure that we cannot get it wrong,\" Caine said.",
      "CIA personnel inside Venezuela had been tracking Maduro's movements since August, including through an agent who penetrated his inner circle and provided key intelligence, according to U.S. officials.",

    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 18:16:19 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 million barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "\"Venezuela's oil infrastructure has also been heavily degraded by decades of underinvestment and much of Venezuela's oil is extremely heavy, making it relatively costly to extract and process,\" Neal Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, noted in a report.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Mike Waltz defended American military actions in Venezuela during an emergency meeting at the United Nations on Monday, and argued that there is no regime change nor U.S. occupation. He repeated the Trump administration's argument that the air and ground assault was not an attack but rather military force used as a tool to assist a law enforcement operation.",
      "\"As Secretary Rubio has said, there is no war against Venezuela or its people. We are not occupying a country,\" Waltz said, according to the readout. \"This was a law enforcement operation in furtherance of lawful indictments that have existed for decades. The United States arrested a narcotrafficker who is now going to stand trial in the United States in accordance with the rule of law for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years.\"",
      "\"This is not regime change this is justice,\" Waltz wrote in a social media post on Saturday.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he is \"deeply alarmed by the recent escalation in Venezuela,\" saying it has \"potential worrying implications for the region.\"",
      "\"The Secretary-General calls on all actors in Venezuela to engage in inclusive dialogue, in full respect of human rights and the rule of law,\" the statement said.",
      "France's foreign minister has already condemned the operation as violating international law, although President Emmanuel Macron said Monday that he \"neither supported nor approved\" the operation, according to France 24.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio told Margaret Brennan on CBS News' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters\" when pressed as to whether the U.S. had ruled out an occupation of Venezuela. Rubio argued that President Trump would not explicitly rule out anything and maintained the power to invoke military force if there are imminent threats. He emphasized that economic pressure was the main tool being used on the remaining indicted regime members who currently run the country.",
      "As noted by Brennan, other officials in Maduro's government who are still in power in Venezuela, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, who have also been indicted in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and have multi-million dollar U.S. government bounties on their heads. Rubio argued Sunday that it was not feasible to arrest four individuals in five different locations in a single complex raid and that there would have been outcry if the U.S. attempted to do so.",
      "\"Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority,\" Rubio said.",
      "As for the Trump administration's ability to control the current regime, Rubio emphasized that the main pressure remains cutting off their financial lifelines.",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",

    "story": [
      "Former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife were arraigned Monday in New York on federal drug trafficking and other charges following their capture in a dramatic U.S. military operation over the weekend. But virtually all of the ousted leader's inner circle \u2014 including some with whom he's accused of running a cartel that has allegedly smuggled tons of cocaine into the U.S. \u2014 remain in their posts.",
      "The U.S., along with many Venezuelans and other nations, believe the election in Venezuela last year was actually won decisively by the party of\u00a02025 Nobel Peace Prize recipient Maria Corina Machado, a longtime leader of the country's persecuted political opposition. Maduro declared victory despite widespread allegations of electoral fraud and intimidation.",
      "But Machado has lived in exile for many months, and her current location wasn't clear on Monday. She appeared to have been largely snubbed by Mr. Trump in his immediate plans for Venezuela, with the U.S. leader saying she lacks the popular support to be installed as a new head of government.",
      "Machado voiced optimism in a statement on Monday that she and \"the brave people of Venezuela\" would soon enjoy freedom and \"celebrate on our land.\" But for now, the people holding the guns and ostensibly running the country are not her supporters, but Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's.",
      "Below is a look at some of the most senior members of the Maduro regime who remain in Caracas \u2014 and in the case of at least one, have just got a promotion.",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The most senior member of Maduro's inner circle untouched by the U.S. attacks and raid over the weekend is probably the country's former Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who was sworn in on Monday as the new interim president, taking the reins from her longtime political mentor.",
      "The 56-year-old has long been seen as a loyal confidant and protege of the now-deposed Venezuelan leader, and a member of a cadre accused by Washington for many years of helping Maduro maintain his authoritarian grip on power.",
      "It wasn't clear on Monday if Rodr\u00edguez and the Trump administration could find a way to work together, and thus whether she could remain in power to some degree following Mr. Trump's assertion that the United States would \"run\" Venezuela for some unspecified period.",
      "Mr. Trump warned over the weekend that if Rodr\u00edguez \"doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\"",
      "Diosdado Cabello",
      "Another stalwart of the Maduro regime is\u00a0Diosdado Cabello, who currently serves as Minister of Interior, Justice and Peace, giving him oversight of the country's police and prisons.",
      "Cabello previously served as vice president, and for many years as president of the country's parliament. He also spent years in command of Venezuelan intelligence services.",
      "Like Maduro, he was indicted on criminal charges in the United States, accused of helping to traffic more than 5 tons of cocaine to the U.S.",
      "In 2020, he was among those charged with various federal drugs and weapons offenses in an indictment filed in the same Southern District of New York that was handling Maduro's arraignment on Monday.",
      "The indictment names Cabello as a senior figure in the Cartel del los Soles, which Maduro is accused of leading.",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez",
      "Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, currently serving as Venezuela's Minister of Defense, is also accused of direct involvement in trafficking drugs into the U.S.",
      "The U.S. accuses him of allowing the safe passage of commercial flights carrying illegal drugs, and of collecting a protection fee for doing so, and he was indicted in a federal court in Washington D.C. in 2020.",
      "Jorge Rodr\u00edguez",
      "The new interim president's brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, has served as President of the National Assembly of Venezuela, the country's Maduro-controlled legislature, since 2021. He's also considered a key figure in the regime.",
      "\"My main function in the days to come... as president of this National Assembly, will be to resort to all procedures, all platforms, and all avenues to bring back Nicolas Maduro Moros, my brother, my president,\" Jorge Rodriguez told lawmakers.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/berlin-power-outage-vulkangruppe-left-wing-arson-attack-called-terrorism/",
    "published": "Mon, 05 Jan 2026 11:44:14 -0500",
    "summary": "As left-wing extremists claim an attack that's plunged Berliners into the dark and cold, the mayor says it isn't \"just arson or sabotage,\" it's terrorism.",
    "story": [
      "Berlin \u2014\u00a0An arson attack claimed by a left-wing extremist group has left tens of thousands of residents in Germany's capital without electricity in the dead of winter for several days. The Saturday morning arson attack on critical electricity infrastructure in southwest Berlin cut power to nearly 50,000 homes and businesses, and renewed scrutiny of a long-running sabotage campaign by the left-wing \"Vulkangruppe.\"",
      "The group claimed responsibility for the fire, which destroyed several high-voltage cables near the Lichterfelde heat and power station and triggered one of the most severe blackouts the capital has experienced in years.",
      "According to Stromnetz Berlin, the operator of Berlin's electricity network, power was cut to as many as 45,000 households and more than 2,000 businesses across four districts in south Berlin.",
      "The power outage also meant many homes lost heating and hot water as temperatures dropped well below freezing in Berlin.",
      "While engineers restored power to parts of the network by Monday, about 30,000 households were still offline as technicians struggled to replace damaged underground cables buried in the frozen soil. The power operator said it didn't expect to have electricity fully restored until Thursday.",
      "In a lengthy statement circulated online and called credible by police, the Vulkangruppe said it had deliberately targeted affluent neighborhoods, to \"cut the juice to the ruling class.\"",
      "The group framed the attack as an act of protest against fossil fuel energy use and the growing power demand created by AI data centers, which it said had accelerated climate change and expanded mass surveillance. The statement included an apology to less wealthy residents caught up in the blackout but it expressed no sympathy for wealthy homeowners left without electricity.",
      "The impact of the attack quickly spread beyond the areas the group said it had intended to target. Hospitals, care homes for the elderly and high-rise building residents who rely on elevators were impacted. Cell phone networks failed in some districts and commuter rail services were disrupted. Police used loudspeakers mounted on patrol cars to inform residents, and some schools delayed reopening after the Christmas and New Year's holiday break.",
      "Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner condemned the arson attack as an \"absolutely unacceptable\" act of terrorism. He warned that assaults on energy infrastructure endangered lives and placed enormous strain on the city's emergency services.",
      "\"These are not childish pranks, but rather professional criminals who attacked these power grids,\" Wegner said in an interview Monday with German public broadcaster RBB. \"This is not just arson or sabotage. This is already terrorism. It was a left-wing extremist group that once again attacked our infrastructure and, in doing so, also endangered the lives of people, of elderly people who may need ventilators, of families with small children, and we now have to catch these perpetrators.\"",
      "Franziska Giffey, the Berlin state's Senator for Economic Affairs, Energy, and Public Enterprises, asked the federal government to help with the criminal investigation into the extremist group's actions, which she called an attack on \"our free society.\"",
      "\"It must be about federal assistance in the investigations,\" she said. \"The question is whether these are merely left-wing activist groups acting out of ideological motives, or whether there is more behind it.\"",
      "Security officials said the arson fit a pattern that's been developing for more than a decade. According to assessments by Berlin authorities and Germany's domestic intelligence services, groups using the name Vulkangruppe or closely related labels have been responsible for a series of attacks on power, rail and communications infrastructure since about 2011.",
      "Early incidents included arson attacks on rail and electricity cables in Berlin that disrupted commuter traffic and caused costly damage. In 2018, a fire set on power lines cut electricity to thousands of households and businesses in the capital, while later attacks targeted research and communications facilities linked to digital infrastructure.",
      "The group has gained more attention in recent years through increasingly high-profile actions. In March 2024, it claimed responsibility for an arson attack on a high-voltage pylon supplying electricity to the Tesla Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg, temporarily halting production at the plant.",
      "In September, another arson attack on power cables in southeast Berlin caused a 60-hour blackout affecting tens of thousands of residents, reportedly the longest power cut in the city since World War II. It was widely attributed to the same extremist collective, though not claimed explicitly by the Vulkangruppe.",
      "Authorities warn that such attacks require little specialist knowledge but can have dramatic and far-reaching consequences, exposing vulnerabilities in densely interconnected urban infrastructure.",
      "The latest blackout has intensified calls for stronger protection of power grids and plans for faster emergency responses to such incidents.",

    "summary": "With Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in U.S. custody, who is Venezuela's new acting President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, and what are her chances of remaining in power?",
    "story": [
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in early Monday as Venezuela's new interim president while her predecessor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro awaited arraignment in a federal U.S. court on drug smuggling charges, two days after he was captured in Caracas by American special forces.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez, 56, is a powerful figure and longtime confidant of Maduro, and she has been backed thus far as the nation's new leader by Venezuela's military. She served as Venezuela's vice president from 2018 until Sunday.",
      "Her brother also holds a senior role in the government as president of the National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, which has long been controlled by the Maduro regime.",
      "She quickly denounced the U.S. operation as a violation of the United Nations founding charter and a unilateral attempt to force regime change on Saturday, but soon adopted a more conciliatory tone.",
      "In a\u00a0social media post following a Cabinet meeting on Sunday, Rodr\u00edguez called for \"respectful international relations\" between Caracas and Washington and extended an invite for \"the U.S. government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation.\"",
      "Venezuela's roughly 30 million people face a deeply uncertain future in the wake of President Trump's actions. It was still unclear on Monday how much autonomy Washington will allow the country, given Mr. Trump's assertion that America will \"run\" Venezuela, at least for some time.",
      "Will the U.S. work with Rodr\u00edguez?",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez and \"she's essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in an interview with\u00a0The Atlantic published on Sunday, he added a warning.",
      "\"If she doesn't do what's right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated in a Sunday interview on CBS News' \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that the U.S. was willing to give Rodr\u00edguez a chance.",
      "\"We are going to make our assessments of people,\" he said of the remaining Maduro regime figures still in place. \"We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some of what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.\"",
      "Speaking on ABC's \"This Week\" the same day, Rubio reiterated, however, that the Trump administration does not consider Rodr\u00edguez or any of her cohorts to have any legitimate claim to power in the country.",
      "\"This is not about the legitimate president. We don't believe that this regime in place is legitimate via an election,\" Rubio told ABC.",
      "\"Ultimately, legitimacy for their system of government will come about through a period of transition and real elections,\" he continued. \"It's the reason why Maduro is not just an indicted drug trafficker \u2014 he [was an] illegitimate president. He was not the head of state.\"",
      "Delcy Rodr\u00edguez's rise to power in Venezuela",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas. Her father was Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a prominent leader of the country's socialist movement that would go on to take power under Maduro's predecessor, Hugo Chavez. The new president's father, however, helped lead the movement before it seized power, and he was arrested for involvement in the kidnapping of American businessman William Niehous in 1976.",
      "He died in police custody, reportedly as he was tortured by the previous Venezuelan regime's security forces.",
      "His daughter Delcy would go on to study law at the Central University of Venezuela, in Caracas, with further periods of education in Britain and France.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez held a number of positions during Ch\u00e1vez's long reign, but she only rose to real prominence under Maduro. From 2013 to 2014, she served as Minister of Popular Power for Communication and Information before being appointed as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a title she held from 2014 to 2017.",
      "She also presided over an assembly created in response to mass street protests in 2017, which was widely seen as an attempt to sideline the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Venezuela's legislature, to enable Maduro to consolidate his rule.",
      "In 2018, Maduro appointed her as Venezuela's vice president, and she remained in that post until stepping in to replace her former boss, as ordered by the country's supreme court following the dramatic events of the weekend.",
      "In 2020, Rodr\u00edguez was also appointed as her country's Minister of Economy and Finance, where she's credited with helping to achieve some progress toward stabilizing Venezuela's sanctions-wracked economy after years of soaring inflation.",
      "In 2024, the role of Minister of Petroleum was also added to her resume.",
      "Despite her very high profile role in the Maduro regime, however, Rodr\u00edguez has not been indicted on any criminal charges in the U.S., though she was hit with sanctions imposed during President Trump's first term, for her role in helping Maduro \"maintain power and solidify his authoritarian rule.\"",

    "summary": "Eva Schloss was a tireless educator about the horrors of the Holocaust.",
    "story": [
      "Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss, the stepsister of teenage diarist\u00a0Anne Frank\u00a0and a tireless educator about the horrors of\u00a0the Holocaust, has died. She was 96.",
      "The Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was an honorary president, said she died on Saturday in London, where she had lived.",
      "Schloss' family remembered her as \"a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace.\"",
      "\"We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind,\" the family said in a statement.",
      "Born Eva Geiringer in Vienna in 1929, Schloss fled with her family to Amsterdam after Nazi Germany annexed Austria. She became friends with another Jewish girl of the same age, Anne Frank, whose diary would become one of the most famous chronicles of the Holocaust.",
      "Like the Franks, Eva's family spent two years in hiding to avoid capture after the Nazis occupied the Netherlands. They were eventually betrayed, arrested and sent to the Auschwitz death camp.",
      "\"Eighty people were pushed in there and there were two buckets -- one with water, one to use as toilets,\" Schloss recalled in 2019 to CBS Minnesota about Auschwitz. \"Once a day, they threw big chunks of bread in, like you would feed wild animals.\"",
      "\"It lives with me all the time. All the time,\" she added.",
      "Schloss and her mother, Fritzi, survived until the camp was liberated by Soviet troops in 1945. Her father, Erich, and brother Heinz died in Auschwitz.",
      "After the war, Eva moved to Britain, married German Jewish refugee Zvi Schloss and settled in London.",
      "In 1953, her mother married Frank's father, Otto, the only member of his immediate family to survive. Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15, months before the end of the war.",
      "Schloss did not speak publicly about her experiences for decades, later saying that wartime trauma had made her withdrawn and unable to connect with others.",
      "After she addressed the opening of an Anne Frank exhibition in London in 1986, Schloss made it her mission to educate younger generations about the Nazi genocide.",
      "\"We said, 'Never again, Auschwitz.' We have learned our lesson,\" Schloss told CBS Minnesota. \"The Germans were not all for Hitler, but they were bystanders and that is what I tell people they shouldn't be.\"",
      "Over the following decades, she spoke in schools and prisons, at international conferences and told her story in books, including \"Eva's Story: A Survivor's Tale by the Stepsister of Anne Frank.\"",
      "She kept campaigning into her 90s. In 2019, she traveled to Newport Beach, California to meet teenagers who were photographed making Nazi salutes at a high school party. The following year she was part of a campaign urging Facebook to remove Holocaust-denying material from the social networking site.",
      "\"People should never, ever forget what has happened and how it came about,\" Schloss told reporters after the closed-door meeting with students, according to CBS Los Angeles. \"I was shocked that in 2019 \u2013 in a well-educated town, in a very highly educated school \u2013 that incidents like this should still happen.\"",
      "Britain's King Charles III said he was \"privileged and proud\" to have known Schloss, who co-founded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.",
      "\"The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world,\" the king said.",
      "Zvi Schloss died in 2016. Eva Schloss is survived by their three daughters, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

      "AI-generated images of Maduro flood social media",
      "After President Trump announced Maduro's capture in a social media post early Saturday morning, questions brewed about the logistics of the mission, where Maduro would be flown and the future of Venezuela. Meanwhile, images of Maduro that were likely manipulated or generated with AI tools circulated on social media, garnering millions of views and thousands of likes across platforms.",
      "One photo purporting to show Maduro after his capture was shared widely, including by the mayor of Coral Gables Florida, Vince Lago, and in a joint Instagram post by two popular conservative content accounts with over 6 million combined followers. Using Google's SynthID tool, CBS News Confirmed team found the photo was likely edited or generated using Google AI.",
      "CBS News also found a video generated from the photo, showing military personnel escorting Maduro from an aircraft. It was posted around 6:30 a.m. \u2014 12 hours before CBS News reported that a person in shackles was seen disembarking the plane carrying Maduro and confirmed his eventual arrival Saturday evening at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",

      "Old videos and images from past events recirculated, purporting to show reactions to Maduro's capture and strikes in Caracas. One video showing people tearing down a billboard image of Maduro dates as far back as July 2024. Another video purporting to show a strike in Venezuela had circulated on social media as far back as June 2025.",
      "Another image showing a man with a sack over his head while sitting in the back of a car circulated widely, sparking online speculation as to whether the photo showed Maduro's capture. Many users flagged that the photo was probably not of Maduro, but as of this afternoon the post had 30,000 likes and over a thousand reposts. A Daily Mail article from 2023 reported that the photo shows Saddam Hussein after his capture, sitting with a Delta Force member, but CBS has not independently confirmed this.",

      "On Monday's episode of \"Armchair Expert with Dax Shepard,\" the 79-year-old singer reflected on her turbulent personal and professional relationship with Bono, with whom she rose to fame in the 1960s as the pop duo Sonny & Cher.",
      "In 1962, the former couple first met in Los Angeles when Cher was 16 and Bono was a 27-year-old aspiring music producer. Bono, who was working with record producer Phil Spector at the time, became Cher\u2019s mentor, manager and creative partner. The two formed Sonny & Cher in 1964 and they tied the knot during an unofficial wedding ceremony in Tijuana, Mexico, later that year.",

      "In 1965, Sonny & Cher made their breakthrough with the success of their song \"I Got You, Babe,\" which topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The duo, who officially married in 1969, went on to release scores of other hits with Bono handling songwriting, production and business, while Cher was the breakout star and the duo's main draw.",
      "Their success later expanded into television when they launched the variety show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour,\" which made them household names in the early 1970s.",
      "While appearing on \"Armchair Expert,\" Cher explained that her relationship with Bono began to unravel at the height of their fame as he began to increasingly control her day-to-day decisions.",
      "The former couple formed the iconic musical duo \"Sonny & Cher.\" (Harry Langdon/Getty Images)",
      "\"This is when now this kind of new side of Sonny comes out,\" Shepard said.",
      "\"Yeah,\" Cher agreed with a nod.",
      "\"Which is like incredibly controlling,\" Shepard continued. \"You have this huge success. There's a lot of money. You're not allowed to leave the house. You're allowed to go shopping. That's pretty much all you're allowed to do, right?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" Cher said.",
      "\"And he's cutting you off from friendships you have,\" Shepard said. \"Was it happening slowly? Was it more like you woke up one day and were like, 'Oh, I don't have a life' or while it was happening, were you like, 'What's going on?'\"",
      "\"It took a little while,\" Cher admitted. \"I couldn't do anything.\"",
      "Cher recounted how she began learning to play tennis and would practice at a friend's house. The \"Believe\" hitmaker recalled a harrowing incident that occurred after Bono discovered that she had been seen at her friend's home during a party after playing tennis.",
      "\"I'm leaving, but she's having a huge party. So there are people coming in,\" she recalled. \"And so Dennis, my friend, told Sonny that I was there, but lots of people were there and lots of men were there.\"",

      "Cher explained that her realization of how Bono was exerting excessive power over her life \"came on kind of slowly.\" The Grammy Award winner said that part of her difficulty with fully grasping the situation stemmed from the difference between how Bono treated her on the set of \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour\" and his behavior at home.",
      "\"I was free on the show, and he was funny, and we got along,\" Cher remembered. \"It's such a strange dichotomy because we would be laughing, and we'd be having the best time and then when we were at home, it was kind of more cut and dried.\"",

      "Shepard cited an incident that Cher wrote about in her 1998 memoir \"The First Time,\" in which she went to get a glass of water in the middle of the night and found another woman \"putting her boots on\" in the home the singer shared with Bono.",
      "Cher told Shepard that she had no thoughts of leaving Bono at the time despite the shocking incident. She explained that she stayed in the relationship largely due to \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\" However, she clarified that her reluctance to leave wasn't because she was driven to preserve the show's massive success.",
      "\"It wasn't that, because I was so happy with the show. And he was so nice on the show. And so, at the show we would be having the best time, and we were more working than we were at home,\" she said. \"It was such a polar opposite, because on stage we had a blast. He let me have all the freedom that I wanted to, and then we came home.\"",
      "\"The show kept us together a lot longer than we would have been anyway, because we had such a good time,\" she continued. \"He was so fun, and he was so funny, and we worked so well together.\"",
      "The two found success with their show \"The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour.\"\u00a0 (CBS)",

      "\"Out of career caution, diagnostic uncertainty, and being private about such things in general, I have been hiding my battle with this disease for over five years,\" he wrote. \"Time to stop.\"",
      "\"CMS is a genetic disease that disrupts the communication between the brain and the muscle at the \u2018nerve/muscle junction\u2019\u2026 or whatever doctors call it,\" Bailey explained. \"There are billions of these junction dodads in a body, and an increasing number of mine seem to be on the blink. Troublesome, little buggers \u2014 right?\"",
      "\"The point is: my muscles aren\u2019t clearly receiving all my brain\u2019s orders to do all the swell things muscles are meant to do,\" he continued. \"It\u2019s a drag.\"",
      "\"The result being that my hands, arms and legs tire quicker than they should, which makes them weaker than, well \u2026 anticipated,\" Bailey added. \"Sustained repetitive movements are particularly difficult and can cause my muscles to temporarily tighten and shut down.\"",

      "\"I can ambulate my way through simple \u2018walks and talks\u2019 with no problem,\" Bailey continued. \"I can still rise to my feet to object to the judge, derail a town meeting, or yell at a cop for being a loose cannon.\"",

      "Parts of the book detail Carson's dislike for the popular sketch comedy show \"Saturday Night Live\" and how the many sketches it did mocking his show contributed to his decision to leave the show.",
      "There were many references to Carson's dislike for the show throughout the book, with actor and director David Steinberg telling Malkoff, \"[Johnny] watched \u2018SNL\u2019 a few times and never liked it.\" Malkoff wrote that, in the late 1970s, Carson wasn't booking any \"SNL\" cast members as guests \"due to his dislike of the show.\"",

      "Two days after Carson allegedly made that comment, Malkoff wrote, \"SNL\" aired the \"Carsenio\" sketch, in which Dana Carvey portrayed Carson as if he were channeling rival talk show host Arsenio Hall. Five days after the sketch aired, Carson made the announcement that he was stepping down and that his last show would be in May 1992.",

      "\"But Johnny had the last laugh,\" the book states. \"In his monologue on May 20, two days before his final show, he said, 'We\u2019ve been with this network for thirty years, and this fall \u2014 I saw the [new] schedule, and they\u2019re coming up with some real great, innovative programming. They\u2019re going to try a comedy version of Saturday Night Live.'\"",

I get to do what I want to do \u2026 my show is really \u2014 it's pop culture meets cabaret meets comedy meets a fashion show, because I do a lot of changes.

      "Many might assume that over-the-counter medications are generally safer than stronger prescription drugs, but research shows they can still present risks for some.",
      "Certain common OTC painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart attacks.",
      "Potential risk of NSAIDs",
      "NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) \u2014 which are used to reduce pain, fever and inflammation \u2014 have been pinpointed as the class of medicines most linked to elevated cardiovascular risk.",
      "NEW HEALTH WARNING ISSUED OVER POPULAR SLEEP AID MILLIONS TAKE NIGHTLY",
      "\"This is because they reduce the production of certain chemicals called prostaglandins,\" Maryam Jowza, M.D., an anesthesiologist at UNC Health in North Carolina, told Fox News Digital. \"These chemicals are involved in inflammation, but they are also involved in other body functions, such as influencing the tone of blood vessels.\"",
      "Certain common OTC painkillers have been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke and heart attacks. (iStock)",
      "Dr. Marc Siegel, Fox News senior medical analyst, echoed the potential risk of NSAIDs.",
      "\"They can lead to high blood pressure, heart attack and stroke via fluid retention and salt retention,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"This increases volume, puts a strain on the heart and raises blood pressure.\"",
      "DIABETES PATIENTS EXPERIENCE LOWER DEATH RATE WITH COMMON MEDICATION",
      "Common examples of NSAIDs include ibuprofen, naproxen, aspirin, diclofenac, indomethacin and celecoxib.",
      "Randomized trials found that ibuprofen caused the biggest spikes in blood pressure, followed by naproxen and then celecoxib.",
      "\"In general, the increase in blood pressure is more likely with higher doses and longer duration of treatment,\" said Jowza, who is also an associate professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the UNC School of Medicine.",
      "COMMON VIRUSES LINKED TO \u2018DRAMATIC\u2019 SPIKE IN HEART ATTACK AND STROKE RISK",
      "NSAIDs can also increase stroke risk, especially at high doses and with long-term use, the doctor added.",
      "Diclofenac was linked to the highest cardiovascular risk, the doctor cautioned. Ibuprofen can also raise blood pressure and has been associated with a higher heart attack and stroke risk, but not as high as diclofenac. Naproxen carries a lower cardiovascular risk than ibuprofen or diclofenac, but is not entirely risk-free.",
      "NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have been pinpointed as the class of medicines most linked to elevated cardiovascular risk. (iStock)",
      "\"The practical takeaway is that diclofenac is generally the least favorable choice in patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, and all NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration,\" Dr. Nayan Patel, pharmacist and founder of Auro Wellness in Southern California, told Fox News Digital.",
      "COMMON VITAMIN COULD PROTECT SOME HEART ATTACK SURVIVORS, STUDY SHOWS",
      "Aspirin is an exception \u2014 although it is an NSAID, it actually reduces the risk of clots when taken at a low dose for prevention, under a doctor\u2019s guidance. However, it can increase bleeding risk and blood pressure at high doses.",
      "Non-NSAIDs safer, but not risk-free",
      "Non-NSAID pain relievers are commonly used for everyday aches, headaches and fever, but not swelling. They act mainly on the brain\u2019s pain signals, not inflammation, according to medical experts.",
      "Acetaminophen, the most common non-NSAID pain reliever, is also linked to an increase in blood pressure, although to a lesser extent, according to Jowza.",
      "\"All NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration.\"",
      "\"Acetaminophen was once thought to have little to no cardiovascular effects, but more recent evidence suggests it can increase blood pressure, especially with higher doses used in the long term,\" she said, emphasizing the importance of blood pressure monitoring. \"Its effect on stroke risk is less clear.\"",
      "Which groups are most vulnerable?",
      "The groups at greatest risk, according to doctors, are those with existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure, prior stroke or heart disease, diabetes or kidney problems.",
      "\"These groups are also more likely to experience NSAID-related fluid retention and destabilization of blood pressure control,\" Patel said.",
      "WANT TO STAY HEALTHY AFTER 40? DOCTORS SAY MEN SHOULD CONSIDER 14 MEDICAL TESTS",
      "Cardiovascular risk is generally higher for people 75 and older, the doctors agreed.",
      "\"Age amplifies risk largely because baseline cardiovascular risk increases with age, and kidney function reserve tends to decline,\" Patel said. \"Older adults are also more likely to be on antihypertensives, diuretics, antiplatelets or anticoagulants, so NSAIDs can destabilize blood pressure control and add safety complexity.\"",
      "Warning signs",
      "Anyone experiencing chest pain, shortness of breath, sudden weakness or numbness, severe headache, confusion, slurred speech or vision changes should see a doctor immediately, Jowza advised.",

      "Safer alternatives",
      "For those at higher risk, Patel recommends non-NSAID approaches whenever possible.",
      "\"For many patients, this means starting with non-drug strategies such as heat or ice, physical therapy and activity modification,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"If medication is needed, acetaminophen is generally preferred over oral NSAIDs from a cardiovascular standpoint, although regular use should still be monitored in people with hypertension.\"",

      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain.

      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",

      "The singer's workouts reportedly involve everything from swimming and kickboxing to cycling and ballet. He has described the routine as \"training for stamina,\" not just to \"go crazy.\"",
      "Why the routine works",

      "\"I\u2019m a huge advocate of diversifying your workouts,\" said Marc Santa Maria, vice president of group fitness at Crunch Fitness in New York. \"Our bodies are meant to move in multi-directional ways and varying speeds, ranges of motion, positions and intensities.\"",
      "\"Sticking with the same workout in the same category each week won\u2019t hit the different ways our bodies need to be maintained and challenged,\" he added.",

      "Alissa Mosca, fitness trainer and regional operations manager at Planet Fitness in New York, told Fox News Digital that one of the biggest advantages of incorporating different training methods is that it creates \"muscle confusion.\"",
      "\"Varying movements, intensities and rhythms force the body to adapt, helping to activate all muscle groups more effectively,\" she said. \"It\u2019s a bit of a \u2018use it or lose it\u2019 philosophy \u2014 if we don\u2019t actively support flexibility and mobility, we risk losing them.\"",

      "Can anyone do this?",
      "\"Mick Jagger\u2019s workout plan is extensive, highly individualized and something he gradually worked up to over time,\" Mosca noted. \"His body responds well because it\u2019s been conditioned for that level of intensity.\"",

      "\"Think of this type of routine like a puzzle,\" Mosca advised. \"You need to find the pieces that work best for you.\"",

      "Santa Maria agreed that Jagger\u2019s approach may be more realistic than many assume. \"I\u2019m an average, everyday person who simply wants to move well, enjoy daily life and stay active for the people and activities I love,\" he said. \"If I can do it, so can anyone.\"",
      "But for those who don\u2019t feel capable of matching Jagger\u2019s intensity, Santa Maria recommends focusing on what feels manageable. \"Trust your instincts \u2014 you know what your body and mental health need,\" he said.",

Sports medicine studies suggest that people with long-term conditioning can safely exceed those minimums when training is progressive and closely managed.",

Deciding ahead of time which days are dedicated to which types of movement \u2014 and removing hesitation by laying out clothes, preparing equipment or booking classes in advance \u2014 can improve consistency, he advised.",
      "Experts say a diverse workout routine that includes cardio, strength, mobility and recovery helps prevent plateaus and supports long-term physical function. (iStock)",
      "Beyond physical benefits, Santa Maria said adding variety to workouts helps to prevent boredom, which can improve adherence over time.",

      "GLP-1 medications have dominated the weight-loss landscape this year \u2014 but some older Americans are reportedly kicking the trend to the curb.",
      "A study published in JAMA in January 2025 \u2014 which looked at more than 125,000 overweight or obese people \u2014 found that nearly 47% of those with type 2 diabetes and 65% of those without diabetes stopped taking their prescribed GLP-1s within a year of starting them.",
      "Dr. John Batsis, a geriatrician and obesity specialist at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, told The New York Times in a recent report that people over 65 years old are \"prime targets\" for this medication, as obesity prevalence is about 40% in older adults.",
      "4 ANTI-AGING APPROACHES REVEALED IN 2025 THAT MAY HELP AMERICANS LIVE LONGER",
      "These drugs, which mimic a natural gut hormone called GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), are primarily used for type 2 diabetes and weight management. However, they have also been tested to target a variety of other conditions, like sleep apnea and cardiovascular events.",
      "Older Americans have been discontinuing their use of GLP-1s for weight loss, according to studies. (iStock)",
      "Starting and stopping these drugs often leads to weight regain, increased appetite and the loss of other associated health benefits, like redued blood pressure and cholesterol, according to Stamford Health and other experts. The risk for obesity-related conditions, such as heart disease and sleep apnea, may also increase.",
      "GLP-1 WEIGHT-LOSS MEDICATIONS LINKED TO IMPROVED CANCER SURVIVAL IN CERTAIN PATIENTS",
      "Despite the risks, some older Americans are reportedly abandoning their weight-loss medications for a variety of reasons, from intense side effects to climbing costs.",
      "Below are four of the main reasons seniors might not stick to their GLP-1 prescriptions.",
      "No. 1: Cost",
      "The price of GLP-1 medications is a major factor in keeping up with treatment, especially as shortages threaten availability.",
      "The New York Times shared the story of 75-year-old Mary Bucklew, a public transit retiree living in Delaware, who had been paying just a $25 monthly co-pay through her health insurance plan to receive Ozempic for weight loss.",
      "The price of GLP-1 medications like Ozempic is a major factor in keeping up with treatment, according to reports. (REUTERS/Hollie Adams/File Photo)",

      "Without the coverage, Bucklew\u2019s prescription would cost more than $1,000 per month out of pocket, leaving her no choice but to stop taking it, per the report.",
      "CLICK HERE FOR MORE HEALTH STORIES",
      "Some GLP-1 manufacturers have made efforts to make the products more accessible. In December 2025, Lilly announced that it would lower the price of Zepbound (tirzepatide) single-dose vials.",
      "\"Far too many people who need obesity treatments still face cost and coverage barriers,\" said Ilya Yuffa, executive vice president and president for Lilly USA, in the announcement. \"Today\u2019s action underscores Lilly\u2019s commitment to improving access across the obesity care landscape. We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Sue Decotiis, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City, confirmed that more than half of seniors stop taking a GLP-1 medication due to cost or side effects.",
      "Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common side effect of GLP-1s. (iStock)",
      "Common side effects often include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bloating, headaches, fatigue and hair thinning, according to experts.",
      "NEW WEGOVY PILL OFFERS NEEDLE-FREE WEIGHT LOSS \u2014 BUT MAY NOT WORK FOR EVERYONE",
      "\"Older patients may be more sensitive to the GI side effects, too,\" Decotiis said. \"Careful monitoring by a physician who is knowledgeable in the area of medical weight loss is imperative.\"",
      "No. 3: Dehydration",
      "Older patients are often dehydrated from the start and do not consume enough water to offset GLP-1 side effects, according to Decotiis.",
      "CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER",
      "\"A body composition scale can determine water muscle mass and bone density, and can show the patient by illustration what they need to do,\" she advised.",
      "In Novo Nordisk\u2019s official Wegovy prescribing information, the drugmaker warns that nausea, vomiting and diarrhea can lead to dehydration, stating that it's \"important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration,\" especially for people with underlying kidney issues.",
      "No. 4: Muscle loss",
      "Muscle loss, which is another side effect of GLP-1 medications, can be \"detrimental\" in this age group, Decotiis cautioned.",
      "When people are dehydrated or don\u2019t consume enough protein, they may lose more muscle and less fat, she said.",
      "Muscle mass loss occurs naturally with age and can be worsened by weight loss drugs, experts warn. (iStock)",
      "An October 2024 review from the American Heart Association cited two recent studies showing that less than half of the weight lost from GLP-1 medications came from fat, with a substantial portion coming from muscle mass.",
      "The loss of muscle among older individuals can lead to an increased risk of falls and fractures. After age 35, muscle mass may decrease by up to 2% each year, according to Harvard Health \u2014 and that number increases to 3% after age 60.",

He recommends that physicians conduct regular body measurements of patients and adjust the medication dosage if benchmarks are not being met.",
      "Finding success and sticking to it",
      "Healthcare providers who approve the use of these medications without \"carefully following\" the patients can contribute to failure of the medications, according to Decotiis.",
      "\"Many of the patients who quit their GLP-1 drugs could have stayed on them with the right personalized care.\"",
      "\"Often, using a customized dosing plan helps the patient avoid undue side effects and helps them burn more fat, which is the mechanism by which GLP drugs work long-term and systemically,\" she told Fox News Digital. \"For certain patients, a high-quality compounded GLP-1 can achieve tailored dosing.\"",

      "Fox News senior correspondent Benjamin Hall unpacks President Donald Trump's prediction about Cuba and economic pressure on various countries on 'America Reports.'",
      "Lawyers for the Trump administration asked a federal judge for additional time this week to detail its plans to provide due process for nearly 150 Venezuelan migrants that it deported to the Salvadoran CECOT prison in March, citing the removal of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the Venezuelan leader who was captured by U.S. troops during a surprise raid in Caracas.",
      "In the motion for an extension, submitted to U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, lawyers for the Justice Department cited the \"substantial changes on the ground in Venezuela\" and the \"fluid nature of the unfolding situation\" in the wake of the U.S. capture of Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores.",
      "They requested an additional seven days to comply with the court's order.",
      "Boasberg, in response, told the Justice Department in a minute order that it had not complied with a local court rule requiring defendants in a civil case to first notify opposing counsel before asking the court for a delay \u2013 leaving the matter temporarily unresolved.",
      "The update comes after months of tension-filled status hearings between lawyers for the Trump administration and lawyers for the 252 Venezuelan migrants who were deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison in March under the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 immigration law, despite an emergency court order that sought to block the administration from immediately using the law to quickly remove certain migrants.",
      "The status of the migrants, who were removed again to Venezuela from CECOT in July as part of a prisoner exchange, further complicated the case.",
      "The exchange and U.S. involvement appeared to indicate at least some level of constructive custody of the migrants, as the court observed, prompting additional status hearings in the case. It also made it more difficult for lawyers representing the plaintiffs to track down all 252 CECOT migrants, some of whom had fled Venezuela due to persecution in their home country, and who have since remained in hiding.",
      "BOASBERG SAYS TRUMP MUST PROVIDE DUE PROCESS TO CECOT MIGRANTS IN US OR ELSEWHERE",
      "James Boasberg, chief judge of the U.S. District Court, arrives at the E. Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse. (AFP via Getty Images\u00a0)",
      "The Trump administration proceeded with the deportation flights, kicking off a complex legal fight over the status of the migrants, the U.S. ability to facilitate their return \u2013 or at least to provide the migrants with due process protections \u2013 and an ability to challenge their alleged gang member status.",
      "Trump officials had argued that the people deported to CECOT were members of the violent Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, though the evidence they used to justify their designations has, in many cases, been disputed and determined to be lacking.",
      "Since March, Boasberg has attempted to determine the status of the hundreds of CECOT plaintiffs, and what ability the U.S. has to facilitate their return, or to provide the class of migrants with due process and habeas protections, including the ability to challenge their alleged gang status.",
      "Last month, Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to submit to the court in writing its plans to provide due process to a class of Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador.",
      "He said the Justice Department must submit to the court by Jan. 5 its plan to provide due process protections to the CECOT class \u2013 which he said the Trump administration could do by either returning the migrants to the U.S. to have their cases heard in person \u2013 or to otherwise facilitate hearings abroad with members of the class that \"satisfy the requirements of due process.\"",
      "\"On the merits, the Court concludes that this class was denied their due-process rights and will thus require the Government to facilitate their ability to obtain such a hearing,\" Boasberg said at the time. \"Our law requires no less.\"",

      "The Justice Department's request for a seven-day extension did not challenge the underlying merits of the order. Instead, they cited only the changing circumstances on the ground in Venezuela, which they said necessitate the additional time.",
      "\"Over the weekend, the United States apprehended Nicol\u00e1s Maduro,\" lawyers for the Justice Department said in their request for additional time. \"As a result, the situation on the ground in Venezuela has changed dramatically. Defendants thus need additional time to determine the feasibility of various proposals,\" they added.",

      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem speaks in Quito, Ecuador, in July 2025. (Getty Images/Alex Brandon)",
      "Boasberg responded in a terse minute order, noting only that the Justice Department's request \"fails to comply\" with the local rule in question, which requires parties to first confer with opposing counsel. He ordered the DOJ to file the relevant notice to opposing counsel by the end of the day.",
      "The update further stalls an ongoing court inquiry that has been on ice for months as the result of appeals court rulings, efforts to shield certain information from the court for national security purposes, and a separate, but related, contempt inquiry.",
      "The CECOT migrants were again moved in July from the Salvadoran prison to Venezuela, as part of a broader prisoner exchange that involved the return of at least 10 Americans detained in Venezuela.",
      "Their role in the prisoner exchange further complicated efforts to ascertain the status of the CECOT class plaintiffs, including some migrants who had fled Venezuela in the first place due to fears of persecution, including from gangs.",
      "That has made it difficult to contact the migrants from the CECOT class and determine how many of them still wished to proceed with their due process cases, as ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, previously told Boasberg in court.",

That list includes developer platforms, cloud service dashboards, social media sites and adult content portals. Local networks and the attacker's own command-and-control domain are excluded, likely to avoid breaking things or raising suspicion.",

      "Attorney Jay Edelson discusses the lawsuit against OpenAI and Microsoft, alleging that ChatGPT exacerbated the mental illness and paranoid delusions of a man who killed his mother and then himself.",
      "Artificial intelligence chatbots are quickly becoming part of our daily lives. Many of us turn to them for ideas, advice or conversation. For most, that interaction feels harmless. However, mental health experts now warn that for a small group of vulnerable people, long and emotionally charged conversations with AI may worsen delusions or psychotic symptoms.",
      "Doctors stress this does not mean chatbots cause psychosis. Instead, growing evidence suggests that AI tools can reinforce distorted beliefs among individuals already at risk. That possibility has prompted new research and clinical warnings from psychiatrists. Some of those concerns have already surfaced in lawsuits alleging that chatbot interactions may have contributed to serious harm during emotionally sensitive situations.",

      "What psychiatrists are seeing in patients using AI chatbots",
      "Psychiatrists describe a repeating pattern. A person shares a belief that does not align with reality. The chatbot accepts that belief and responds as if it were true. Over time, repeated validation can strengthen the belief rather than challenge it.",

      "Mental health experts warn that emotionally intense conversations with AI chatbots may reinforce delusions in vulnerable users, even though the technology does not cause psychosis. (Philip Dulian/picture alliance via Getty Images)",
      "Clinicians say this feedback loop can deepen delusions in susceptible individuals. In several documented cases, the chatbot became integrated into the person's distorted thinking rather than remaining a neutral tool. Doctors warn that this dynamic raises concern when AI conversations are frequent, emotionally engaging and left unchecked.",
      "Why AI chatbot conversations feel different from past technology",
      "Mental health experts note that chatbots differ from earlier technologies linked to delusional thinking. AI tools respond in real time, remember prior conversations and adopt supportive language. That experience can feel personal and validating.",
      "For individuals already struggling with reality testing, those qualities may increase fixation rather than encourage grounding. Clinicians caution that risk may rise during periods of sleep deprivation, emotional stress or existing mental health vulnerability.",
      "How AI chatbots can reinforce false or delusional beliefs",
      "Doctors say many reported cases center on delusions rather than hallucinations. These beliefs may involve perceived special insight, hidden truths or personal significance. Chatbots are designed to be cooperative and conversational. They often build on what someone types rather than challenge it. While that design improves engagement, clinicians warn it can be problematic when a belief is false and rigid.",
      "Mental health professionals say the timing of symptom escalation matters. When delusions intensify during prolonged chatbot use, AI interaction may represent a contributing risk factor rather than a coincidence.",

      "Psychiatrists say some patients report chatbot responses that validate false beliefs, creating a feedback loop that can worsen symptoms over time. (Nicolas Maeterlinck/Belga Mag/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "What research and case reports reveal about AI chatbots",
      "Peer-reviewed research and clinical case reports have documented people whose mental health declined during periods of intense chatbot engagement. In some instances, individuals with no prior history of psychosis required hospitalization after developing fixed false beliefs connected to AI conversations. International studies reviewing health records have also identified patients whose chatbot activity coincided with negative mental health outcomes. Researchers emphasize that these findings are early and require further investigation.",
      "A peer-reviewed Special Report published in Psychiatric News titled\u00a0\"AI-Induced Psychosis: A New Frontier in Mental Health\" examined emerging concerns around AI-induced psychosis and cautioned that existing evidence is largely based on isolated cases rather than population-level data. The report states:\u00a0\"To date, these are individual cases or media coverage reports; currently, there are no epidemiological studies or systematic population-level analyses of the potentially deleterious mental health effects of conversational AI.\"\u00a0The authors emphasize that while reported cases are serious and warrant further investigation, the current evidence base remains preliminary and heavily dependent on anecdotal and nonsystematic reporting.",
      "What AI companies say about mental health risks",
      "OpenAI says it continues working with mental health experts to improve how its systems respond to signs of emotional distress. The company says newer models aim to reduce excessive agreement and encourage real-world support when appropriate. OpenAI has also announced plans to hire a new Head of Preparedness, a role focused on identifying potential harms tied to its AI models and strengthening safeguards around issues ranging from mental health to cybersecurity as those systems grow more capable.",
      "Other chatbot developers have adjusted policies as well, particularly around access for younger audiences, after acknowledging mental health concerns. Companies emphasize that most interactions do not result in harm and that safeguards continue to evolve.",
      "What this means for everyday AI chatbot use",
      "Mental health experts urge caution, not alarm. The vast majority of people who interact with chatbots experience no psychological issues. Still, doctors advise against treating AI as a therapist or emotional authority. Those with a history of psychosis, severe anxiety or prolonged sleep disruption may benefit from limiting emotionally intense AI conversations. Family members and caregivers should also pay attention to behavioral changes tied to heavy chatbot engagement.",

      "Tips for using AI chatbots more safely",
      "Mental health experts stress that most people can interact with AI chatbots without problems. Still, a few practical habits may help reduce risk during emotionally intense conversations.",
      "Avoid treating AI chatbots as a replacement for professional mental health care or trusted human support.Take breaks if conversations begin to feel emotionally overwhelming or all-consuming.Be cautious if an AI response strongly reinforces beliefs that feel unrealistic or extreme.Limit late-night or sleep-deprived interactions, which can worsen emotional instability.Encourage open conversations with family members or caregivers if chatbot use becomes frequent or isolating.",

      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",
      "REAL APPLE SUPPORT EMAILS USED IN NEW PHISHING SCAM",
      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8 steps you can take to stay safe from fake AI chat malware",
      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "What's in your \"digital file\" and why it's a problem in 2026",
      "Data brokers work like factories. They pull information from the apps you use, websites you visit, loyalty cards you scan, public records and even location data from your phone. Then they combine it into a shockingly detailed picture of your life, including:",

They use broker data to tailor scams, impersonate companies you interact with and even mimic family members.Deepfake phone scams are exploding: When a scammer knows your relatives' names, phone numbers, travel dates and habits, a deepfake call becomes dangerously believable.Data breaches are more frequent than ever: Your info doesn't get leaked once; it gets leaked again and again because brokers constantly resell it.The more data you leave exposed, the easier identity theft becomes: One exposed address or phone number is annoying.

      "If you want 2026 to be your safest year yet, the best thing you can do is reduce the amount of personal data available about you online, starting with data brokers.",
      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning. Now multiply that by 180\u2013500+ data brokers, depending on your location. This is why most people never delete their information: it's just too time-consuming.",
      "The simplest fix: automate the removals",
      "This is where a data removal service helps. These services automatically request the removal of your personal information from hundreds of data brokers on your behalf.

      "The holiday season creates a surge in data sharing. Retailers, loyalty programs, airlines, travel sites and apps collect huge amounts of personal information in November and December. Shoppers often share email addresses, phone numbers and location data to unlock discounts and faster checkout.",
      "Holiday spending continues to rise year over year. More spending means more data. As a result, your personal information spreads across more databases than at any other time of the year.",
      "After the holiday rush, data brokers update and expand their profiles using newly collected information. January is when many of these companies organize, repackage and resell their datasets.",
      "Starting the removal process early helps limit how widely your information gets shared. Since removals can take days or even weeks, acting now reduces exposure before that data circulates further.",
      "From January through April, scammers ramp up activity tied to tax season. Common threats include\u00a0IRS impersonation scams, fake refund messages and W-2 fraud. Many of these attacks rely on data pulled from broker databases.",
      "When scammers have accurate personal details, their messages feel more convincing. Reducing your data exposure now lowers the risk. Removing your information from major data broker sites is a strong first step. It also helps to check smaller, lesser-known sites that may still list your details.",

      "Using a reputable data removal service can simplify the entire process. These services automate requests to remove your personal information from data brokers, including many sites that are difficult to handle on your own.",
      "Start by searching for your name on Google. Look for results that show your address, date of birth, phone number, or email address. Sites that display this information often belong to data brokers or businesses that sell personal data for profit.",
      "Make a short list of the pages where your information appears.",
      "Instead of spending weeks contacting each site manually, a data removal service can handle the work for you. You submit the links you found, and the service requests removals on your behalf across hundreds of databases.",

      "You want stronger privacy protections in 2026",

      "Data brokers do not stop collecting information. Even after removals, your data can reappear months later. Ongoing monitoring helps catch new listings and remove them before they spread further.",
      "That long-term protection is what keeps your data footprint smaller throughout the year.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming.

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

      "Harvard students claim the university has enabled antisemitic campus protests, allegedly resulting in lenient discipline and a sudden post-Trump-era crackdown that they say reflects growing national backlash against university radicalism.",
      "Harvard University's president took a jab at the school's faculty in a recent podcast, saying that activism in the classroom has led to student fears of speaking freely.",
      "\"That\u2019s what had shifted, and that\u2019s where I think we went wrong,\" Harvard President Alan Garber said during a podcast released on Dec. 16.",
      "\"Because think about it, if a professor in a classroom says, this is what I believe about this issue, how many students \u2014 some of you probably would be prepared to deal with this, but most people wouldn\u2019t \u2014 how many students would actually be willing to go toe to toe against a professor who\u2019s expressed a firm view about a controversial issue?\" he continued.",
      "Garber appeared on the Identity/Crisis Podcast, hosted by the Shalom Hartman Institute. He and podcast host Yehuda Kurtzer discussed freedom of political discourse on Harvard's campus, some of it in the context of antisemitism that has plagued Ivy League universities in recent years.",

People will do that, and we want to make sure that the education that we give them will enable them to do that with some real authority,\" he continued. \"But we\u2019re not about the activism. We\u2019re not about pushing particular points of view. Other than that, you should be logical, firmly grounded in the evidence and rigorous in how you approach these issues.\"",
      "Garber said that Harvard's mission is excellence in teaching, learning and research and to be excellent in those areas, \"we have to be capable of speaking with one another, freely hearing one another, risking being rejected or saying something offensive, if that\u2019s necessary, to be able to have effective communication.\"",

      "From staged heroics and shifting identities to a later murder-for-hire plot against his wife, a crime expert says Maher\u2019s long arc offers rare insight into how certain offenders escalate rather than reform.",
      "According to former FBI special agent Jason Pack, Maher\u2019s behavior reflects a recognizable pattern among offenders who manufacture crises, seek control and continue deceiving long after their first crime is exposed.",
      "Maher, an American who said he had been a Green Beret, was a private nurse hired to care for Safra when a fire broke out inside Safra\u2019s heavily secured Monaco penthouse in the early hours of Dec. 3, 1999. Safra and another nurse, Vivian Torrente, died of smoke inhalation after locking themselves inside a bathroom believed to double as a safe room.",

      "Maher survived and initially told authorities that two hooded intruders armed with knives had broken into the apartment \u2014 a claim Monaco officials later said could not be corroborated, according to The New York Times.",
      "After days of conflicting accounts, Maher admitted to police that he had set the fire himself by igniting a wastepaper basket, Monaco\u2019s chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet said at the time, The Times reported. Maher told investigators he did not intend to kill anyone and said he had fabricated the intruder story to \"draw attention to himself,\" Serdet said.",
      "Serdet told reporters Maher was jealous of Safra\u2019s seven other nurses and hoped to win his employer\u2019s approval by staging a rescue. \"He wanted to be a hero,\" Serdet said, according to The Times.",

      "Investigators said Maher slashed himself twice with his own knife \u2014 once in the thigh and once in the stomach \u2014 before seeking help from the building\u2019s concierge, The Times reported. Officials said Safra and Torrente could have escaped the fire but remained inside the locked bathroom because Safra feared attackers were still inside the apartment.",
      "Safra\u2019s death stunned the world of international banking and sparked widespread speculation about whether he had been targeted because of his business dealings. Newspapers around the world theorized that Safra, a Lebanese-born banker, may have been killed because of his financial relationships, including dealings involving Russian investors, The Times reported.",
      "Investigators ultimately rejected those theories. Serdet said Maher acted alone and that there was \"no complicated intrigue\" behind the fire, according to The Times.",
      "The fire came at a pivotal moment in Safra's life. According to The Times, he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and was preparing to retire as a deal to sell his banking empire, including Republic National Bank of New York, neared completion.",

      "His death marked the loss of far more than a banking titan. He was not only one of the world\u2019s wealthiest bankers, but a major global philanthropist whose foundation has funded education, medical research, humanitarian aid and religious institutions across more than 40 countries \u2014 a legacy that continues decades after his death.",
      "According to The Times, Safra believed he had powerful enemies, a concern fueled by his banking career and cooperation with U.S. authorities, which contributed to the intense security measures inside the Monaco penthouse.",
      "Safra\u2019s security concerns were rooted in real events, according to Vanity Fair. Dominick Dunne, who wrote extensively about the case, said Safra had alerted U.S. authorities to Russian organized crime activity tied to his banking business \u2014 a move that left him deeply fearful.",
      "\"He turned in the Russian mafia to the FBI,\" Dunne told \"48 Hours.\" \"He became very paranoid about his safety.\"",
      "Pack said that environment is critical to understanding how Maher\u2019s original story took hold. In his view, Maher tailored his intruder narrative to fit Safra\u2019s fears, making the account initially plausible to investigators and the public.",
      "\"When a man spends decades trying to sell a \u2018hero\u2019 story,\" Pack said, \"you eventually have to stop listening to the music and start looking at the math.\"",
      "A new Netflix documentary, \"Murder in Monaco,\" has revived interest in the case and Maher\u2019s claims of innocence. But Pack said the most revealing evidence lies not in revisiting that night in 1999, but in the decades of conduct that followed.",
      "Pack said Maher\u2019s conduct since the Monaco case further undermines his claims of being a coerced or misunderstood figure.",
      "In 2002, Maher was convicted of arson causing death and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After serving roughly eight years in prison, he returned to the United States, changed his name and later became entangled in additional crimes.",

      "Pack described what he called a pattern of staged crises and deception. In Monaco, he said, Maher manufactured a fire to engineer a heroic rescue. Decades later, prosecutors said he plotted another staged event, this time with lethal intent to gain financially.",
      "Pack also pointed to Maher\u2019s decision to reinvent himself under a new name after prison as further evidence of deception rather than rehabilitation.",

      "\"When someone changes his identity to escape his past, that conduct defines his character,\" Pack said.",
      "Maher has claimed for years that his confession in Monaco was coerced. But Pack said Maher\u2019s later actions severely undercut that narrative.",
      "\"It\u2019s easy to blame a foreign police force when you\u2019re the only one talking,\" Pack said. \"But when you\u2019re caught orchestrating a murder from a jail cell in New Mexico, the victim story is finished.\"",

      "\"That became very real very quickly,\" McElearney said.",

      "Israel has made clear it will not allow Turkish armed forces to operate inside Gaza, viewing Ankara as a destabilizing actor despite its public efforts to present itself as a reconstruction partner. Turkish sources told Fox News Digital that Ankara does not seek to deploy troops in Gaza, instead focusing on humanitarian aid, infrastructure projects and political influence.",
      "Dan Diker, president of the Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs, said Israel views Turkey as a strategic threat rather than a neutral actor.",
      "\"From Israel\u2019s point of view, Turkey is the arsonist behaving like the firefighter in Gaza,\" Diker told Fox News Digital. \"If Turkey is allowed to enter Gaza with several thousand armed men, you can guarantee that this Muslim Brotherhood country will destabilize Gaza and dismantle the very 20-point plan that President Trump has bet the farm on.\"",

      "\"President Trump is very, very good at keeping adversaries close, together with allies,\" Diker said. \"That\u2019s why he keeps saying that he likes Erdogan. He wants to keep Erdogan in the party. He wants to keep him close.\"",

      "Despite Erdogan\u2019s harsh rhetoric toward Israel and vocal support for the Palestinian cause, Turkish diplomatic sources say Ankara is acting pragmatically. While Turkey sees financial and political opportunity in Gaza\u2019s reconstruction, those sources say Erdogan is aware there is little domestic appetite for sending Turkish troops into the enclave.",
      "That gap between rhetoric and policy, analysts say, is likely to persist. As Diker put it, Trump is trying to keep the diplomatic structure intact while Israel works to contain what it sees as Turkey\u2019s expanding regional footprint. \"Trump does not want to topple the apple cart,\" Diker said. \"He wants to try to keep everyone together so that they can move to stage two of the 20-point plan in Gaza.\"",

      "As Iran experiences yet another day of anti-regime protests across the country, Jason Brodsky, the policy director of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), who has written about Maduro\u2019s nefarious activities, told Fox News Digital that, \"Maduro\u2019s capture will be a blow to Iran\u2019s interests in the Western Hemisphere as he was a longtime ally of Tehran under the banner of anti-imperialism and Americanism in the region.\"",
      "He said, \"How much of a blow it will be will depend on who comes to power after Maduro. Iran and Hezbollah have used Venezuela as an operational hub for terrorism, drug trafficking, and power projection in Latin and South America.\"",

      "He continued, \"Iran had a military partnership with Caracas as well, especially with drones. So Tehran is likely eyeing these developments very warily. Its interests in the region were already weakened after Bolivia\u2019s presidential election, which brought to power a center-right leader who reestablished relations with Israel.\"",
      "In November, Fox News Digital reported that the Islamic Republic was backing Maduro just as the Trump administration stepped up military pressure in the Caribbean and expanded its crackdown on criminal networks tied to the regime in Caracas.",
      "Brodsky said, \"This will be a strike heard around the world. Iran\u2019s regime will be watching it very closely as President Trump threatened the supreme leader during the 12-Day War. This historic strike adds to the perception of President Trump being unpredictable and risk-ready, which inspires fear in U.S. adversaries and bolsters the credibility of the threat of American military force.

      "Trump\u2019s longtime threats to seize Denmark\u2019s territory of Greenland have been widely derided in Europe, mocked even, as outlandish talk that could surely never translate into the United States effectively invading a NATO ally.",
      "But Trump's willingness and ability to capture Maduro \u2014 and his suggestion that Greenland and its own vast natural resources may be next \u2014 have raised worries that there may be more to this Arctic ambition.",
      "It has triggered the strongest protests yet against Washington\u2019s hostile overtures, including from longtime U.S. allies in Europe.",
      "\u201cNo more pressure. No more hints. No more fantasies about annexation,\u201d Greenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Facebook post Sunday.",
      "\u201cWhen the president of the United States talks about \u2018we need Greenland\u2019 and connects us with Venezuela and military intervention, it\u2019s not just wrong. This is so disrespectful,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.\u201d",
      "Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, was more forthright Monday. \u201cIf the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,\u201d she told public broadcaster DR, according to Reuters.",
      "\u201cI have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth. After Maduro\u2019s capture, he doubled down on the idea, telling reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, \u201cWe need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump ordered the military operation in Venezuela to capture Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. But in the aftermath, Marco Rubio is in the spotlight.",
      "Tasked with overseeing the transition of a post-Maduro Venezuela, Rubio has stepped into his fourth \u2014 and potentially riskiest \u2014 Trump administration role, and the coming weeks and months could define his standing as one of the president\u2019s top advisers. A fixation for Rubio for more than a decade, Venezuela has now become a high-stakes gambit for Trump that could shape his own legacy.",
      "And at a news conference with Trump following the stunning capture of Maduro and his wife, an emboldened Rubio put other world leaders on notice they could be next.",
      "\u201cDon\u2019t play games while this president\u2019s in office because it\u2019s not gonna turn out well,\u201d Rubio said.",
      "As Maduro and his wife were making their first court appearance in New York on federal narco-terrorism and conspiracy charges on Monday, the challenges of a U.S.-led transition were coming into focus. Rubio was already softening the president\u2019s pronouncements that the U.S. would \u201crun\u201d Venezuela for an unspecified period of time.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not running \u2014 it\u2019s running policy, the policy with regards to this,\u201d he said during an interview on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d contradicting Trump\u2019s message. Rubio said the U.S. military forces that have been amassed near Venezuela would stay put for now, and a quarantine on sanctioned Venezuelan oil would remain to pressure the country\u2019s new leader, Maduro\u2019s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, to fall in line.",
      "Democrats, already seething over the administration\u2019s decision to keep Congress in the dark on the Maduro operation, now question how far the administration will go.",
      "\u201cWhere will this go next? Will the president deploy our troops to protect Iranian protesters? To enforce the fragile ceasefire in Gaza? To battle terrorists in Nigeria? To seize Greenland or the Panama Canal? To suppress Americans peacefully assembling to protest his policies?\u201d said Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia.",
      "Rubio has been at the forefront of the increasingly aggressive and complex foreign policy of Trump\u2019s second term. Trump first tapped the 54-year-old former senator from Florida to serve as secretary of state, then added national archivist and interim national security adviser to his portfolio, as the president has consolidated leadership positions across his administration.",
      "It\u2019s a remarkable trajectory for Rubio, said Republican strategist Matthew Bartlett, a former senior State Department official in the first Trump administration.",
      "\u201cNow he is not just influencing, but directing, leading just a remarkable engagement in our hemisphere, and potentially, remaking a new order,\u201d Bartlett said. \u201cHow that plays out will truly be not just the president\u2019s legacy, but certainly Secretary Rubio\u2019s legacy too.\u201d",
      "Rubio has had key roles in other major foreign policy initiatives, any one of which is a heavy lift \u2014 from Trump\u2019s efforts to maintain a peace agreement between Israel and Hamas to ending the war in Ukraine. But inside Trump\u2019s inner circle, Rubio has owned Venezuela. For him, it\u2019s personal: As a Cuban American senator in Florida, Rubio was focused on the abuses in Venezuela for nearly three decades, first under Hugo Chavez and now Maduro. The effort is popular in his home state, where many Venezuelans and similarly displaced Cuban Americans, including Rubio\u2019s own parents, sought sanctuary from repressive regimes.",
      "Cuban government television announced over the weekend that 32 Cuban combatants died in the U.S. military action against Venezuela. And Cuba, where the economy has been battered by a U.S. embargo, had been relying on sanctioned oil shipments from Maduro until the Trump administration\u2019s quarantine.",
      "Rubio framed Maduro\u2019s arrest as a warning to the \u201cincompetent senile men\u201d running Cuba, saying, \u201cIf I lived in Havana and I were in the government, I\u2019d be concerned, at least a little bit.\u201d",
      "With Rubio at his side, Trump increasingly ramped up pressure on Venezuela, including a U.S. military campaign against alleged drug-smuggling boats that has roiled the Western Hemisphere and significantly escalated on Saturday with Maduro\u2019s capture and removal to the U.S.",
      "The policy is a significant escalation from Trump\u2019s first term, when his administration increased and expanded sanctions on Venezuela. Trump publicly threatened to use military action if necessary and the U.S. officially recognized former opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate president of Venezuela in 2019. But pressure stopped there.",
      "\u201cI think, as Rubio persuaded him, he began to see that it was going to be potentially very important,\u201d said John Bolton, who served as Trump\u2019s national security adviser during the first administration and who is now one of his sharpest critics.",
      "But if Rubio has shown Trump the potential value of a more aggressive response, he now has to deliver on what Trump wants. And his influence with the president \u2014 and position as the face of his Venezuela policy \u2014 could cut both ways.",
      "\u201cRubio\u2019s job is to accomplish something close to what the president says can be accomplished,\u201d said Neumann, who served as ambassador to Afghanistan, Bahrain and Algeria during the George W. Bush administration.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s between a rock and a hard place,\u201d said Neumann.",
      "Rubio\u2019s positions have already seemed to shift. The U.S. is not turning to Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado, who recently won the Nobel Peace Prize, or Edmundo Gonzalez, who greatly outpolled Maduro in the 2024 election that Maduro then stole. Last January, Rubio called Gonzalez Venezuela\u2019s rightful president.",
      "After meeting with exiled Venezuelan opposition figures last May, Rubio also called for the release of Maduro\u2019s political prisoners and the restoration of democracy in Venezuela. Neither of those goals has been raised by Trump or Rubio since Saturday.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, the vast majority of the opposition is no longer present inside of Venezuela,\u201d Rubio said during Sunday\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d interview.",
      "He also said elections in Venezuela are \u201cpremature at this point\u201d despite the country\u2019s constitution calling for the vice president to succeed to the presidency and organize elections within 30 days.",
      "The U.S. has not had a diplomatic presence in Venezuela since 2019. The State Department is making preparations for possibly reopening the U.S. embassy in Caracas if Trump decides to take that step, according to a senior State Department official.",
      "American diplomats who focus on Venezuela currently are based in neighboring Colombia. More than half of the countries in Latin America do not have confirmed U.S. ambassadors. Those vacancies, coupled with the Trump administration\u2019s cuts to the U.S. Agency for International Development and the U.S.\u2019s chief international broadcaster Voice of America, leave Rubio with fewer regional allies and resources.",
      "\u201cThe challenges he faces would, in conventional times, cause him to rely heavily on his senior staff at the State Department and counterparts at USAID and Voice of America,\u201d said Douglas Lute, a retired Army general and former ambassador to NATO. \u201cThat just emphasizes the challenges he faces.\u201d",
      "Richard Fontaine, the chief executive officer of the Center for a New American Security, said Rubio\u2019s dual-hatted roles as secretary of state and national security adviser complicate his ability to be the point person on a challenge as big as Venezuela.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason why you have not, since Henry Kissinger, had the role of National Security Advisor and Secretary of State been held by the same person,\u201d Fontaine said. \u201cThere are only 24 hours in a day, and you can only be in one place at the same time.\u201d"

      "When the deposed Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro goes on trial in New York, he will be represented by an experienced lawyer who is no stranger to complex cases at the intersection of geopolitics and the law.",
      "Maduro has tapped the services of Barry J. Pollack, a partner at Harris St. Laurent & Weschler LLP, a boutique law firm based in New York, where the authoritarian former leader and his wife face various charges, including narco-terrorism conspiracy. Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, pleaded not guilty at their first court appearance Monday, when Pollack was by the ousted president\u2019s side.",
      "Pollack previously represented WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, steering the anti-secrecy activist\u2019s legal strategy in the U.S. for more than a decade. Pollack helped secure a 2024 plea deal that led to Assange\u2019s release from prison.",
      "Assange pleaded guilty to one count of violating the Espionage Act for publishing classified military and diplomatic documents. He had been accused of conspiring to unlawfully obtain and release top-secret national defense information, and federal investigators said his leaks jeopardized national security.",
      "Andy Birrell, the president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, a group that Pollack once headed, told NBC News that his colleague\u2019s experience representing an internationally controversial defendant like Assange was good preparation for the Maduro case.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s always challenges in high-profile cases, but Barry\u2019s a veteran,\u201d Birrell said. \u201cHe\u2019s done it before.\u201d",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Pollack did not immediately reply to an interview request for this article. In a brief exchange with an NBC News reporter after Maduro\u2019s arraignment, Pollack said: \u201cI think what President Maduro said in court speaks for itself.\u201d Maduro, speaking through a translator in court, declared his innocence, claimed he was \u201ckidnapped\u201d and insisted he was still president of Venezuela.",
      "In an interview with the legal publication Lawdragon published in early April, Pollack was asked what he found most fulfilling about his profession. In his response, Pollack said he felt fortunate to have formed a personal rapport with nearly every client he has represented.",
      "\u201cTypically, when I meet with a client, they are facing what may be the worst crisis that they have ever faced,\u201d Pollack told Lawdragon. \u201cAt the end of the day, it\u2019s no longer a stranger who I\u2019m seeing get through to the other side of this terrible piece of their life. It\u2019s somebody that I\u2019ve come to know and respect.\u201d",
      "It was not immediately known what led Maduro to hire Pollack, a graduate of Indiana University and Georgetown University School of Law. (Flores is represented by a different attorney: Mark Donnelly, a veteran Houston prosecutor.)",
      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t have to do anything he doesn\u2019t want to do and doesn\u2019t feel is the right thing to do,\u201d Birrell said of Pollack. \u201cBeyond that, I don\u2019t know what his selection methods are. Whatever they are, I think President Maduro is going to be the beneficiary of them.\u201d",
      "Birrell said Pollack is known for being a \u201cmeticulous\u201d and \u201cunassuming\u201d professional who understands how to clearly explain complex legal concepts and persuade juries.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s a person that absolutely reeks credibility,\u201d Birrell said. \u201cI think that Barry\u2019s a person who presents as someone who is trying to get at the truth and people like that, they respect that.\u201d",
      "C. Melissa Owen, the president-elect of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, agreed with that assessment, praising Pollack\u2019s courtroom communication abilities.",
      "\u201cI would say he has Ivy League intellect with Midwestern sensibilities in terms of being able to communicate with the American public,\u201d Owen said.",
      "Pollack\u2019s legal career spans more than 30 years, according to his firm\u2019s website. In that time, according to the law firm guide Chambers USA, Pollack cultivated a reputation in elite legal circles as a \u201cthorough and deep-thinking lawyer\u201d who \u201clives, breathes and sleeps trials.\u201d",
      "Assange\u2019s case was perhaps Pollack\u2019s most notable foray into the national spotlight before Maduro enlisted him.",
      "Assange and his website claimed responsibility for leaking classified U.S. military documents and videos from the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, including video of an Apache helicopter attack in Baghdad that killed civilians. The disclosures drew wide attention and embarrassed the U.S. government.",
      "In remarks to reporters after Assange\u2019s release in 2024, Pollack argued that his client never should have been charged under the Espionage Act and framed the case as a test of free speech rights.",
      "\u201cHe has suffered tremendously in his fight for free speech, for freedom of the press, and to ensure that the American public and the world community gets truthful and important newsworthy information,\u201d Pollack said.",
      "Pollack previously won a complete acquittal for Michael Krautz, a former Enron accountant who faced criminal fraud charges. The not guilty verdict for Krautz was hailed by Pollack\u2019s firm as one of the few acquittals stemming from the various prosecutions that followed the collapse of Enron, one of the most spectacular business sagas of the early 2000s.",
      "He also defended Martin Tankleff, a New York man who served 17 years in prison after having been wrongfully convicted of killing his parents as a teenager. Pollack managed to get those convictions reversed and all charges against him dismissed.",
      "\u201cI think he has skill sets from a lifetime of representation that makes him very well prepared for defending this type of case,\u201d Owen said."

      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Sunday on Instagram, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

      "A mysterious online bettor made more than $400,000 on Polymarket, a website that lets people wager cryptocurrency on the odds of real-world events occurring, by correctly predicting the U.S. would invade Venezuela and topple President Nicolas Maduro.",
      "The bets, which are viewable on Polymarket\u2019s website, have prompted fresh concern that the rise of Polymarket and other platforms like it can allow insiders privy to confidential or even classified information to easily use their knowledge to profit.",
      "In the early hours of Saturday, the U.S. military conducted a special operation to capture Maduro and his wife and bring them to the U.S. to face narco-terrorism charges.",
      "Polymarket does not facilitate contact among users. The account in question has made only 13 bets, totalling $33,934.34. All of them were placed between Dec. 27 and Jan. 3 and were related to the probability of the U.S. soon invading Venezuela and of Maduro being removed from office. It\u2019s unclear when and where the account was created. Polymarket did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "President Trump claimed earlier in December that Maduro\u2019s days were \u201cnumbered,\u201d but had generally refrained from publicly offering specifics about an operation to remove Maduro. U.S. officials told NBC News that Trump decided before Christmas to authorize the operation in Venezuela, but kept the actual day in flux. The timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until late Friday night, the officials said. That night, before the news was public, the Polymarket user placed their largest and final bets, wagering more than $14,000.",
      "The identity of the bettor, their location and whether they were a direct or indirect recipient of knowledge of a pending classified U.S. military operation \u2014 or simply extraordinarily and improbably lucky \u2014 is unknown.",
      "But it does not appear that they have tried to hide their tracks, said a spokesperson for Chainalysis, a company that tracks and analyzes cryptocurrency transactions, most of which are public. The person has already cashed out their Polymarket winnings in Solana, a type of cryptocurrency, through a major American exchange, with no indication they have tried to hide or launder the funds, the Chainalysis spokesperson said. If any regulators or law enforcement went looking for the bettor, they\u2019d likely have little difficulty locating them.",
      "At least four other Polymarket accounts seen by NBC News made bets only in connection with Maduro being out of office by the end of January, though theirs were comparatively smaller. All these bets were placed between Thursday and Saturday for between $700 and $900, and they made between $7,000 and $14,000. It was not possible to determine if those people had inside information or simply guessed correctly.",
      "The rapid proliferation of prediction markets has created a betting market for just about anything, whether it be mundane, consequential or miraculous.",
      "There\u2019s money to be made for predicting whether entrepreneur and reality television star Kim Kardashian will pass the bar exam, whether a nuclear weapon will detonate this year or whether the Second Coming of Jesus Christ will occur within the next 12 months.",
      "But that massive scope of prediction markets, and the open-source way that companies adjudicate the results, leaves the door open for potential manipulation.",
      "Take one example concerning the war between Russia and Ukraine. Polymarket users are able to bet on which country\u2019s army will control certain cities, all laid out in a map kept current by an independent think tank, the Institute for the Study of War. Bettors who predicted Russia would capture the city of Myrnohrad by Nov. 15 were paid out when the market resolved to \u201cyes,\u201d citing that think tank map. But days later, the institute said in a statement that \u201can unauthorized and unapproved edit to the interactive map of Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine was made on the night of November 15-16 EST.\u201d Last month, 404 Media reported that the edit briefly showed Russia capturing Myrnohrad before it disappeared.",
      "Betting platforms also have dozens of political markets, where users can wager on the winners and losers of individual races across the country, both primary and general elections.",
      "There have been controversial instances of D.C. insiders betting on politics, most notably Sean McElwee, formerly of the progressive data firm Data for Progress. McElwee left the firm in 2022, in the aftermath of that year\u2019s midterm elections and the indictment of a key ally, billionaire and political megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried, for fraud related to the FTX cryptocurrency exchange he ran. A 2023 Washington Post book excerpt detailed how McElwee had bet thousands of dollars on races his firm was working on, including telling the book\u2019s author he commissioned some polls \u201cmostly\u201d to get more information to inform his betting.",
      "Prediction markets currently operate in a legally murky area, having once faced restrictions and scrutiny that have loosened, in part, under the Trump administration. Polymarket previously banned Americans from the platform, based on rules from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), a federal agency that regulates U.S. derivatives markets.",
      "This summer, the CFTC told Polymarket it was dropping a probe into the company and on Nov. 25, Polymarket said that the CFTC had approved it to operate as a U.S. exchange. New users are still prompted to check a box saying they are not a U.S. person or located in the U.S. to create an account, but Polymarket has begun rolling out options for Americans to bet.",
      "Congressman Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y., plans to introduce legislation tackling the topic later this week. Called the Public Integrity in Financial Prediction Markets Act of 2026, the bill looks to explicitly criminalize the act of capitalizing on nonpublic information on such sites, a spokesperson for his office said.",
      "David Chase, a former Securities and Exchange Commission attorney who now works as a securities defense attorney, told NBC News that using inside information to gain a financial edge in commodities trading is generally considered fraud, but that legal precedent has been slow to tackle the legality of betting on such information.",
      "\u201cI think that the courts are going to have to catch up to this, as they typically do,\u201d Chase said."

      "The price of oil seesawed overnight, but as of 4 p.m. ET Monday, it was trading about 1.8% higher. The price of both U.S. crude oil, known as West Texas Intermediate or WTI, and internationally based Brent crude rose more than $1.",
      "More broadly, investors did not react to the upheaval in Venezuela by selling stocks, as they have in previous times of geopolitical uncertainty.",

      "But experts warn that accomplishing anything near a return to full capacity oil production in Venezuela will likely take years.",
      "\u201cVenezuela\u2019s current oil exports are small in the global context, and any effort to develop Venezuela\u2019s world-leading oil reserves at scale will necessarily be a long-term story due to poor infrastructure,\u201d Evercore ISI analyst Matthew Aks wrote in a note to clients over the weekend.",
      "Venezuela has been \u201cpumping almost nothing by comparison to what they could have been,\u201d Trump said in his Saturday remarks.",
      "U.S. sanctions have contributed to the years long decline of Venezuela's oil infrastructure and the nation's output. It was unclear Monday whether the Trump administration's plans to revitalize the oil industry include lifting longstanding sanctions and Trump's blockade of oil tankers leaving the country.",
      "The geopolitical uncertainty Monday boosted the value of precious metals, known as \"safe havens\" for investors. Gold rose 2.6% and silver traded higher by more than 5.2%."

You. Wondrous, singular, YOU. I will miss you till the end of time. Thank you @winterstone for my forever reminder, of one of my forever people.\u201d",

      "Yang\u2019s final episode came on Dec. 20, in the midst of his eighth season on the long-running show. Rogers, who co-hosts the \u201cLas Culturistas\u201d podcast with Yang, can\u2019t believe the legacy he leaves behind on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cI know a lot of people are surprised because they feel like he\u2019s such a fixture,\u201d Rogers said while guest co-hosting TODAY with Jenna & Friends on Jan. 5. \u201cBut seven and a half years on the show, five Emmy nominations, countless memorable characters and sketches, so many indelible \u2014 and he was there for the 50th (anniversary of the show).\u201d",

      "Rogers said that moment illustrated how much Yang enjoyed \u201cSNL,\u201d but realized the time had come to say goodbye.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s what makes it really hard to say goodbye, is you know that what you have in the day in and day out is so good, but sometimes you do have to leave the party just a little bit, like you don\u2019t want to be the last one,\u201d he said.",
      "Rogers watched Yang\u2019s final episode in a hotel room in Orlando and was struck by the enormity of what was taking place.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m literally on my back watching this insane moment happen that is not only such a huge moment in \u2018SNL\u2019 and then in many ways, pop culture, but for us personally,\u201d he said.",
      "Rogers, who said he and Yang will work the upcoming Winter Olympics, also couldn\u2019t help but think back to Yang\u2019s early experience on \u201cSNL.\u201d",
      "\u201cI remember years ago auditioning for the show, like him going through it,\u201d he said. \u201cHe screen-tested for that several times. (He) was a writer for a year before he went on the cast, and then, really, against a lot of odds, became the face of that show. And I told him at the end, I was like, \u2018You know, not only did you succeed here. You thrived here.\u2019 And I couldn\u2019t be prouder of him. And the good news is, we\u2019re busy as hell now.\u201d",

      "\u201cI loved working at SNL, and most of all i loved the people,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cI was there at a time when many things in the world started to seem futile, but working at 30 rock taught me the value in showing up anyway when people make it worthwhile.\u201d"

      "However, getting the ring wasn't easy. Mel Robbins said that Christopher Robbins ran into a little issue once he tried to get her a \"little diamond eternity band\" from a place inside the Empire State Building. Upon checking out, she said he realized that his credit card wasn't working, so he had to ask his brother for money.",
      "Then, there was the challenge of getting in touch with her father to ask for her hand.",

      "\"And he had a ring. And that was that,\" she added.",
      "The couple ended up getting married in 1996 in Michigan. They share their three kids, Sawyer, 26, Kendall, 25, and Oakley, 20, together.",
      "Mel Robbins posted a tribute to her husband for their 29th anniversary in August 2025 and shared what they've learned since getting married.",
      "One of her lessons came directly from the theory that sparked her viral hit book: Let them.",
      "\"Stop trying to change people and learn how to love them as they are,\" she said. \"Most fights, resentment and frustration comes from wishing people were different. The more you let people be themselves, the better your relationships will be.\""

But again, the goal of it was that it would work as a standalone story, but also works as a companion piece in a way.\u201d"

      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",
      "The episode's title, \"The Rightside Up,\" indicates what happens in the finale: Things are put, well, right, and that involves the closing of the Upside Down, the portal that opened in Season 1.",
      "Eleven and Will (Noah Schnapp) defeat Vecna. But there's more that needs to be done: The Upside Down itself needs to be destroyed.",
      "Eleven seems to understand her role in the next phase of the plan, but others in her life are resistant. \"I have to end the cycle,\" Eleven tells Hopper (David Harbour), her adoptive father.",

      "So does he create a story that helps him cope with his new reality, or has he really picked up on an alternate explanation of Eleven's fate?",
      "At the end of the episode, the gang is back playing Dungeons and Dragons. Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next.

      "Ross Duffer said Eleven's death, or disappearance, was integral to the story ending. Eleven represents childhood \u2014 and the finale is all about the kids of \u201cStranger Things\u201d growing up.",
      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",
      "There was no way Eleven was going to carry out Hopper\u2019s dream of her becoming a \u201cregular\u201d girl, essentially.",
      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "Read on to learn more about Marty Reisman, the real-life man who inspired \"Marty Supreme.\"",
      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",
      "Reisman told several interviewers he began playing ping-pong as a child to deal with his debilitating anxiety.",
      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his memoir.",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in \"Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments at the age of 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",
      "He was survived by his wife Yoshiko, a daughter, Debbie Reisman, and several grandchildren, per his obituary."

      "Keep an eye on these books and set your new year off in literary style.",
      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",
      "Isaac says: \"'The Rest of Our Lives' is a brilliantly humane and wildly absorbing story. Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism. Namwali Serpell uses intellectual rigor alongside inventive flair to tackle Toni Morrison\u2019s writing in ways that feel both fresh and deeply expanding. This book is an illuminating guide to understanding how best to read, understand, and admire one of American literature\u2019s greatest voices.\"",
      "\"Lost Lambs\" by Madeline Cash",

Madeline Cash explores adolescence, faith, family, and power through the lens of a tightly controlled religious community, where devotion and vulnerability exist side by side. With wildly inventive writing, Lost Lambs captures moral uncertainty and emotional awakening with remarkable precision. This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",
      "\"Mei Mei The Bunny\" by Laufey",
      "Isaac says: \"'Mei Mei the Bunny' is a gentle, charming children\u2019s book about a shy but curious bunny learning how to be brave, kind, and true to herself. Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments. A great read aloud to return to again and again with the young ones in your life.\"",
      "Adriana Trigiani's picks",
      "\"Skylark\" by Paula McLain",
      "Adriana says: \"Paula McLain returns to Paris in this page-turning tale that goes between Alouette Voland\u2019s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 and Dr. Kristof Larson\u2019s dangerous mission during German occupation in 1939. Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",
      "\"Work in Progress\" by James Martin, SJ",
      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",
      "Adriana says: \"Sadeqa Johnson is the master of historical fiction and 'Keeper of the Lost Children' does not disappoint. Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",
      "Adriana says: \"'One Whole Hippopotamus' is an adorable introduction to early learning for our smallest readers. Acclaimed author Carter Higgins gives us an interactive and vibrant book perfect for teachers, librarians and parents to share with their little ones.\""

      "In the wake of the extraordinary U.S. capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the international spotlight has fallen on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the country\u2019s interim leader and a key player in an explosive geopolitical drama.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Sunday on Instagram, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

This is so disrespectful,\u201d he added. \u201cOur country is not an object of superpower rhetoric. We are a people. A land. And democracy. This has to be respected. Especially by close and loyal friends.\u201d",
      "Denmark's prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, was more forthright Monday. \u201cIf the United States attacks another NATO country, everything stops,\u201d she told public broadcaster DR, according to Reuters.",
      "\u201cI have made it very clear where the Kingdom of Denmark stands, and Greenland has repeatedly said that it does not want to be part of the United States,\u201d she said. \u201cUnfortunately, I think the American president should be taken seriously when he says he wants Greenland.\u201d",
      "Trump and his team have for months said they want to take over the vast semi-autonomous Danish territory, citing its strategic importance and mineral wealth. After Maduro\u2019s capture, he doubled down on the idea, telling reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, \u201cWe need Greenland, from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it, I can tell you.\u201d",
      "He mocked local efforts to defend the sparsely populated island, saying \u201cthey added one more dog sled\u201d that would be no match for the \u201cRussian and Chinese ships\u201d he claimed were \u201call over the place\u201d around the territory.",
      "(That rationale is disputed by experts: Peter Viggo Jakobsen, an associate professor at the Royal Danish Defence College, told NBC News that these ships \"do not exist.\u201d)",
      "Adding to the alarm, Katie Miller, a right-wing podcast host and the wife of Trump adviser Stephen Miller, posted an image of Greenland superimposed with the American flag and the caption \"SOON!\"",
      "Though Trump stunned the world by sending aircraft and personnel to grab Maduro in Caracas, intervention in Greenland would arguably carry greater risk of escalation.",
      "Denmark\u2019s NATO membership carries with it the implied protection of Article 5 \u2014 the promise that an attack on one ally will be treated as an attack on all. However, the U.S. is by far the biggest contributor to NATO and has historically been seen as the ultimate guarantor behind its pledge of mutual self-defense.",
      "Germany indicated Monday that European allies would be prepared to step in.",
      "\u201cSince Denmark is a member of NATO, Greenland will, in principle, also be subject to NATO defense,\u201d Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul told reporters in Lithuania. \u201cAnd if there are further requirements to strengthen defense efforts concerning Greenland, then we will have to discuss this within the framework of the alliance.\u201d"

      "BEIJING \u2014 An attack on a country after a military buildup and embargo at sea. A leader deposed by a superpower that views them as illegitimate.",
      "While some are drawing parallels between the United States\u2019 dramatic action in Venezuela and China\u2019s ambitions for Taiwan, experts say Beijing is less concerned about the self-ruled island\u2019s sovereignty and instead views the attack as an opportunity to undermine America\u2019s global leadership.",
      "As the Trump administration withdraws from global institutions and upends long-standing norms, Beijing has sought to cast itself as the true champion of the rules-based international order. Chinese state media commentaries on the Venezuela attack argue that the U.S. is now one of the biggest threats to that order, and that its actions have undermined its credibility in Latin America.",
      "\u201cThis is a country which just behaved like a hegemon, right?\u201d said Wu Xinbo, dean of the Institute of International Studies at Fudan University in Shanghai. \u201cHow can you trust a country that would deal with its weak neighbors this way?\u201d",
      "China has strongly condemned the U.S. capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, saying it violated international law and threatens peace and security in Latin America. It said the U.S. should immediately release Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who are set to appear Monday in a New York court on drug trafficking and other charges.",
      "On Monday, Chinese leader Xi Jinping appeared to refer to the  attack on one of his country\u2019s main South American allies, saying the world was experiencing turbulence and that \u201cunilateral bullying seriously impacts the international order.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll countries should respect the development path independently chosen by other peoples, abide by international law and the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter, and major countries should take the lead,\u201d he said during a meeting in Beijing with Irish Prime Minister Miche\u00e1l Martin, without mentioning the U.S. by name.",
      "His comments came a day after Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said no country \u201ccan play the role of world policeman, nor do we agree that any country can claim itself to be an international judge.\u201d",
      "China has long served as an economic lifeline for the heavily sanctioned Venezuela, accounting for the majority of its crude oil exports. It has expressed support for Venezuela in recent months amid President Donald Trump\u2019s military buildup, though it has no security commitments to the country and experts say it has avoided more concrete action in part to preserve the U.S.-China trade truce.",
      "Maduro was seized hours after he met in Caracas with Qiu Xiaoqi, Beijing\u2019s special envoy for Latin American affairs, in his last publicly reported official meeting.",
      "It is unclear whether Qiu and the rest of his delegation are still in Venezuela. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said Monday that there were \u201cno reports of Chinese personnel in Venezuela being affected by U.S. airstrikes.\u201d",
      "In a caption accompanying photos and videos posted on his Instagram account, Maduro described the meeting as \u201ca fraternal encounter that reaffirms the strong ties of brotherhood and friendship between China and Venezuela.\u201d",
      "China, which is already South America\u2019s top trading partner, is seeking to expand its influence in the region, even as Trump has put it at the center of his national security agenda. Though Beijing has emphasized economic ties and nonintervention in its approach to Latin America, there was a greater focus on military and law enforcement cooperation in the policy paper it released last month.",
      "\u201cAll the countries in the region have more or less healthy relations with China,\u201d said B\u00e1rbara Fern\u00e1ndez Melleda, an assistant professor of Latin American studies at the University of Hong Kong. \u201cAnd if the United States becomes hostile against China through Latin American countries, that\u2019s a new scenario.\u201d",
      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela, where Chinese companies have invested billions, has raised alarm in China, Wu said.",
      "Latin American countries may feel pressured \u201cto be more cautious in dealing with China on the economic front in the future,\u201d he told NBC News in an interview. \u201cAnd also for the Chinese business community, they see not just uncertainty but rising risk from this region.\u201d",
      "'Two different issues'",
      "The U.S. attack on Venezuela has also raised fears that it could embolden China to move against Taiwan, the self-ruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory and has vowed to bring under its control, by force if necessary.",
      "And for some users on China\u2019s heavily censored social media, Trump\u2019s assertion that the U.S. was \u201cin charge\u201d after Maduro was captured was a source of inspiration.",
      "\u201cThe arrest of the Venezuelan president set a good example for us. Taiwan\u2019s William Lai must be trembling in fear now!\u201d read one comment on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, referring to Lai Ching-te, the president of Taiwan.",
      "But Venezuela and Taiwan are \u201ctwo different issues,\u201d according to Wu at Fudan University. \u201cVenezuela is an independent sovereign state, and Taiwan is part of China,\u201d he said, adding that China prefers \u201ca peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue.\u201d",
      "The events in Venezuela will not \u201cdramatically alter Beijing\u2019s calculus on Taiwan,\u201d said Ryan Hass, director of Brookings\u2019 John L. Thornton China Center, adding that China will focus on protecting its interests in Latin America.",
      "\u201cPrivately,\u201d he said on X, \u201cI expect Beijing will emphasize to Washington it expects to be given the same latitude for great power exemptions to international law that the U.S. takes for itself\u201d \u2014 particularly in the South China Sea, a strategically vital shipping route that China claims virtually in its entirety.",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "Add NBC News to Google",
      "The Taiwanese government has yet to comment publicly on Maduro\u2019s capture.",
      "The island has been under growing pressure from Beijing, which encircled it last week in a large-scale military exercise that simulated a blockade. The live-fire drills followed the announcement of an $11.1 billion arms package for Taiwan by the U.S., the island\u2019s biggest weapons supplier.",
      "The U.S. strike in Venezuela could slow down China\u2019s timetable for an attack on Taiwan, \u201cbut may give ammunition to U.S. skeptics\u201d on the island who worry that Washington won\u2019t come to its defense, said Wen-Ti Sung, a nonresident fellow with the Atlantic Council\u2019s Global China Hub who is based in Taiwan's capital, Taipei.",
      "The U.S. military\u2019s ability to carry out a Maduro-style \u201cdecapitation strike,\u201d especially against Venezuela\u2019s largely Chinese defense systems, could make Beijing think twice about testing its military against Washington\u2019s, Sung said via a messaging app.",
      "But the strike also reinforces the view that the U.S. is \u201cpreoccupied with the Western Hemisphere, and skeptics will wonder in whose sphere of influence Taiwan falls within this Monroe Doctrine 2.0,\u201d he said, referring to Trump\u2019s twist on the 19th-century U.S. foreign policy.",
      "Others say China has refrained from attacking Taiwan not because it lacks global permission, but because it is simply not ready.",
      "\u201cChina has never lacked hostile intent toward Taiwan; what it truly lacks is the ability to carry it out,\u201d Wang Ting-yu, a senior lawmaker from Taiwan\u2019s governing Democratic Progressive Party, said Sunday in a post on Facebook.",
      "\u201cChina is not the United States, and Taiwan is certainly not Venezuela. If China could really do it, it would have acted long ago!\u201d",

      "In the wake of the extraordinary U.S. capture of Venezuelan strongman Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the international spotlight has fallen on Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, the country\u2019s interim leader and a key player in an explosive geopolitical drama.",
      "President Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that Rodr\u00edguez had been \u201csworn in\u201d as president and stood \u201cwilling to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\u201d Rodr\u00edguez has sent mixed signals, however, insisting that Maduro remains Venezuela\u2019s \u201conly president,\u201d while also pledging to \u201ccollaborate\u201d with the Trump administration.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s de facto leadership of Venezuela caps a remarkable political ascent for an official who has served in a variety of roles in the governments of both the late socialist President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and Maduro, who once called her a \u201ctiger\u201d for her vociferous defense of his left-wing authoritarian regime.",
      "Here\u2019s what you need to know about Rodr\u00edguez, 56, as Maduro faces a federal indictment in the United States and the immediate fate of Venezuela hangs in the balance.",
      "Revolutionary roots",
      "Rodr\u00edguez was born in Caracas on May 18, 1969. She is the daughter of Marxist guerrilla fighter Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez, a co-founder of the Socialist League, a militant revolutionary party that was particularly active in the 1970s.",
      "Jorge Antonio Rodr\u00edguez was arrested in connection with his alleged involvement in the 1976 kidnapping of American businessman William F. Niehous. The elder Rodr\u00edguez died in police custody at the age of 34. The saga became a foundational memory for his daughter and one of the raisons d\u2019etre for her political career.",
      "\u201cThe revolution is our revenge for the death of our father and his executioners,\u201d Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was quoted as telling a Venezuelan politician in 2018, referring to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s socialist political program.",
      "She has close political ties with her older brother, Jorge Rodr\u00edguez, a psychiatrist by training who serves as president of the National Assembly, the country\u2019s unicameral legislature. He was the country\u2019s vice president under Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013.",
      "Extensive r\u00e9sum\u00e9",
      "Rodr\u00edguez is a lawyer by training who graduated from the Central University of Venezuela in 1993. She went on to study labor law in Paris and social sciences in London before she launched her Venezuelan political career in the early 2000s.",
      "She held various low-profile positions in the Ch\u00e1vez regime before she took on a more visible profile as communication and information minister in 2013. Then came the job of foreign minister, from 2014 to 2017, as well as a role heading the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s loyalty to Maduro earned her influence and stature, according to Ryan C. Berg, the director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank. It was the principal reason she was \u201chandpicked\u201d for the vice presidency in June 2018, making her second in the country\u2019s line of succession, Berg said.",
      "\u201cShe has survived in multiple positions because of her ability to exercise power effectively within that regime,\u201d Berg told NBC News.",
      "In a post on social media announcing Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s ascension to the vice presidency, Maduro described her as \u201ca young woman, brave, seasoned, daughter of a martyr, revolutionary and tested in a thousand battles.\u201d",
      "In recent years, Rodr\u00edguez added even more responsibilities to her vice presidential portfolio, taking on roles as finance and oil minister. The latter gave her oversight over Venezuela\u2019s most crucial business sector and coveted export \u2014 and tested her resolve as she attempted to deal with severe U.S. sanctions on the country\u2019s oil industry and the toll of inflation.",
      "Rodr\u00edguez has never faced U.S. criminal charges, though she was sanctioned by the first Trump administration for the role she allegedly played in squashing political dissent in Venezuela.",
      "Uncertainty ahead",
      "It remains to be seen whether Rodr\u00edguez will stay in power, and the rhetoric from the leaders of both Venezuela and the U.S. has fluctuated since Maduro\u2019s stunning capture.",
      "Trump said Saturday that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in contact with Rodr\u00edguez, describing her as \u201cgracious\u201d and willing to work with the American government as it prosecutes Maduro on narco-terrorism charges in New York.",
      "In a televised address, Rodr\u00edguez struck a more antagonistic tone, reportedly blasting the \u201cextremists\u201d in the Trump administration and insisting that Maduro was Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader despite his capture and indictment by the U.S. government.",
      "\u201cWhat is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez said, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Sunday on Instagram, Rodr\u00edguez used far more diplomatic language, emphasizing the need for a more \u201cbalanced and respectful relationship\u201d between Venezuela and the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe extend an invitation to the U.S. government to work together on a cooperation agenda, oriented toward shared development, within the framework of international law, and to strengthen lasting community coexistence,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez wrote in part.",
      "Trump then presented a stark warning to Rodr\u00edguez, telling a reporter for The Atlantic: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t do what\u2019s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.\u201d",
      "Even if Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s interim role turns into a more permanent position, she will still need to fortify her political standing inside Venezuela and what remains of the Maduro regime, according to Berg.",
      "\u201cShe does not enjoy support from some of the main factions\u201d in Venezuela, Berg said, \u201cand most importantly, she\u2019ll have to consolidate support over the armed forces.\u201d"

      "Follow live updates",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",

      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",

They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",

      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",

But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "As he turned to go back inside, he told NBC News at the scene Friday, \u201chell\u201d erupted as a deadly fire broke out. \u201cI heard a big boom, and everybody was screaming,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",

      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",

      "Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cWe all saw really horrible things that no one should ever have to see.\u201d",
      "Eric Bonvin, the general director of the regional hospital in Sion that took in several dozen injured people, said those with severe burns face months of treatment.",
      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

      "Trump and his team have ramped up hostile suggestions that they want to seize Greenland, a vast Artic island of just 50,000 people that has mineral and strategic significance. The U.S. attack against Venezuela and capture of President Nicolas Maduro \u2014 which the United Nations said undermined international law \u2014  has raised fears that this might not be an empty threat.",
      "Follow live coverage here",
      "The European leaders were in Paris meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner and special envoy Steve Witkoff and others, according to a White House official. It is the latest in frenzied rounds of shuttle diplomacy to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Though these negotiations have accelerated since November, the U.S. attack on Venezuela and continued suggestions of seizing Greenland have cast a shadow over the talks, which are being held with the very allies who \u2014 under NATO\u2019s principle of collective defense \u2014 Trump is suggesting attacking.",
      "\u201cThe Kingdom of Denmark \u2014 including Greenland \u2014 is part of NATO,\u201d the allies said in a joint statement.",

Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders. These are universal principles, and we will not stop defending them,\u201d said the statement, issued by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, and prime ministers Mette Frederiksen of Denmark, Keir Starmer of Britain, Giorgia Meloni of Italy, Donald Tusk of Poland and Pedro S\u00e1nchez of Spain.",
      "It added that \u201cthe United States is an essential partner in this endeavor, as a NATO ally\u201d and through a 1951 defense agreement allowing Washington to build military bases on the vast island. \u201cGreenland belongs to its people,\u201d it said. \u201cIt is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland,\u201d the statement added.",
      "One of the key elements being discussed in Paris is Ukraine and Europe\u2019s desire for \u201csecurity guarantees,\u201d which could come in the form of a multinational force being deployed to Ukraine to ensure Russia does not launch further attacks.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s president called the meeting \u201ca new opportunity to end this war,\u201d in a statement Saturday.",
      "And Macron had said Tuesday\u2019s gathering of the so-called \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d would see the powers \u201cmake concrete commitments\u201d to Ukraine\u2019s security as part of any future peace deal with Russia.",

      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said much the same Monday, telling her country\u2019s TV2 broadcaster that \u201cif the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops.\u201d",
      "Even without the building panic over Greenland, it remains a colossal ask to bridge the chasm between Russia\u2019s insistence on its hardline demands and the fears held by Ukraine and Europe that Vladimir Putin may use a deal as a launchpad to attack again.",
      "Zelenskyy said that a peace deal is \u201c90%\u201d there, albeit suggesting that the final 10% contains the thorniest issues.",

      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "Last week, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "\"We have to fix the country first. You can\u2019t have an election. There\u2019s no way the people could even vote,\" Trump said about the possibility of a vote in the next month. \"No, it\u2019s going to take a period of time. We have \u2014 we have to nurse the country back to health.\"",

      "\"I think we can do it in less time than that, but it'll be a lot of money,\" he said. \"A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent and the oil companies will spend it, and then they\u2019ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.\"",
      "He also insisted the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.",
      "\"No, we\u2019re not,\" Trump said. \"We\u2019re at war with people that sell drugs. We\u2019re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country.\"",
      "In the roughly 20-minute interview, Trump identified a group of U.S. officials \u2014 including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, deputy White House chief of staff Stephen Miller and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 who will help oversee America\u2019s involvement in Venezuela.",

      "Trump\u2019s discussion of his vision for Venezuela came just a couple of hours after Maduro was arraigned in New York on a series of charges including narco-terrorism conspiracy and cocaine importation conspiracy. He was seized from a compound in the capital city of Caracas in the wee hours of Saturday morning during a raid by U.S. special forces and law enforcement officials.",
      "Maduro pleaded not guilty, saying he remains the leader of his country even as Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez was sworn in Monday as his successor.",
      "Trump said Rodr\u00edguez has been cooperating with U.S. officials but insisted there was no communication between her camp and the American side before Maduro's ouster.",
      "\"No, that\u2019s not the case,\" he said, adding that a determination will be made soon about whether existing sanctions against Rodr\u00edguez will be left in place or lifted.",
      "When asked if there was \"any deal with any official in Venezuela to remove\" Maduro, Trump replied, \"Well, yeah, because a lot of people wanted to make a deal, but we decided to do it this way,\" adding that it was without the help of Maduro's inner circle.",
      "Trump also declined to say whether he's spoken to Rodr\u00edguez yet, but he said that Rubio \"speaks to her fluently in Spanish\" and that their \"relationship has been very strong.\"",
      "He indicated that the U.S. could launch a second military incursion into Venezuela if Rodr\u00edguez stops cooperating with U.S. officials but said he does not believe that will be necessary. Trump also suggested he had initially expected to have to send in American forces again already.",
      "\"We\u2019re prepared to do it,\" he said. \"We anticipated doing it, actually.\"",
      "Trump also denied a Washington Post report that he had dismissed the possibility of Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado running the country because she won the Nobel Peace Prize last year \u2014 an award long sought by Trump.",
      "\"She should not have won it,\" he said. \"But no, that has nothing to do with my decision.\"",
      "Having campaigned on an \"America First\" platform and his desire to end wars, rather than start them, Trump has seen some of his political allies question the wisdom of the U.S. entering into a long-term commitment in Venezuela.",
      "But he said in the interview that he is confident his political base will stick with him.",
      "\"MAGA loves it. MAGA loves what I\u2019m doing. MAGA loves everything I do,\" Trump said. \"MAGA is me. MAGA loves everything I do, and I love everything I do, too.\"",
      "Critics in both parties have noted that Trump did not seek a new authorization from Congress to launch Saturday morning's raid, and he said in the interview that he would not need lawmakers to act in order for him to send American troops back in.",
      "\"We have good support congressionally,\" he said. \"And Congress knew what we were doing all along, but we have good support congressionally. Why wouldn't they support us?\"",

      "Senior Iranian officials fired back, warning that U.S. intervention would spark regional chaos and make American forces in the Middle East \"legitimate targets.\"",
      "It comes after protests in the Islamic Republic took a sharply violent turn in recent days, with at least seven deaths reported by a human rights organization and at least three reported by a semiofficial news agency.",
      "The protests erupted Sunday in the capital, Tehran, with crowds largely chanting about economic grievances after the country's currency hit a record low against the dollar as prices soar.",
      "People have since taken to the streets in smaller cities, and the protests have taken a more political bent with slogans targeting the clerical regime and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's highest authority.",
      "Iran\u2019s economy has been battered by years of sanctions and a 12-day war with Israel last June \u2014 when the U.S. military also attacked the country\u2019s nuclear facilities \u2014 added to the sense of popular unease. A water crisis also led to taps running dry at times late last year.",

      "A photo shows partygoers hoisting wine bottles fitted with sparklers, yet even as they toast the occasion flames are already visible on the foam soundproofing lining the low ceiling of the bar at the upscale Alpine ski resort.",
      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",

      "One video \u2014 like that photo, geolocated by NBC News to inside the venue in the early hours of New Year's Day \u2014 suggests that the panic was not immediate.

Another person attempted to beat the flames with a white T-shirt.",

The nationality is unknown for 14 of those injured.",
      "On Thursday evening, mourners had arranged hundreds of candles at a traffic circle near the venue, which had by this point been covered up in white plastic by authorities. There was an air of somber stillness, with the mostly young crowd sharing hugs, and expressions of shock and disbelief.",
      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin described it Thursday as \u201cone of the worst tragedies that our country has experienced.\u201d",
      "Geneva University Hospitals said it was treating five people. Most patients were young, between 15 and 30 years old, said Dr. Robert Larribau, the chief physician at the hospitals' emergency department.",
      "He told NBC News that many of them had \"serious injuries\" that appeared to have been caused by the twin phenomena of \"backdraft\" and \"flashover.\"",
      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities said they had ruled out terrorism, saying that an explosion at the venue was caused by the fire, rather than the other way round.",
      "They have not commented on the images of bottles fitted with sparklers. Those novelty drinks have appeared in past promotional videos for the bar, served by waiting staff wearing helmets rimmed with neon lights.",

Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
