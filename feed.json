      "France's government is defending its decision to grant citizenship to George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney, citing their contributions to France's international influence and cultural outreach",
      "PARIS -- Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were granted French citizenship because \u201cthey contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France\u2019s international influence and cultural outreach,\u201d the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \u201cOcean\u2019s\u201d series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \u201chorrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\u201cThe message being sent is not good,\u201d Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \u201cThere is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\u201d",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn\u2019t clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\u201cThey maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\u201cLike many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \u201cs\u201d at the end.",

      "The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant",
      "NEW YORK -- The Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny has redefined what it means to be a global giant \u2014 and he may once again make history at the 2026 Grammy Awards.",
      "The artist born Benito Antonio Mart\u00ednez Ocasio is up for six awards at the Feb. 1 show, becoming the first Spanish-language artist to be nominated for album, song and record of the year simultaneously. His critically acclaimed album, \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d is only the second Spanish-language record to be nominated for album of the year. The first? Well, that also belonged to Bad Bunny, 2022\u2019s \u201cUn Verano Sin Ti.\u201d",
      "Win or lose, experts say Bad Bunny's Grammy nominations mark a symbolic moment for Latinos. Just a week later, after all, he'll headline the Super Bowl halftime show.",
      "Vanessa D\u00edaz, associate professor of Chicano and Latino studies at Loyola Marymount University and co-author of \u201cP FKN R: How Bad Bunny Became the Global Voice of Puerto Rican Resistance,\u201d says Bad Bunny's nods extend beyond his own art and serve as a \u201cvery welcome recognition of Latin music that is growing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMusic from the Spanish-speaking Caribbean has been shaping global music tastes since the 19th century,\u201d adds Albert Laguna, associate professor of ethnicity, race and migration and American studies at Yale. \u201cBad Bunny is another link in a much longer chain of the popularity of Caribbean music on a global stage.\u201d",
      "Much of this music \u2014 particularly Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n, the genres Bad Bunny got his start in and continues to use in his new work \u2014 has been historically criminalized in Puerto Rico, not unlike hip-hop in the United States. Reggaet\u00f3n in particular, D\u00edaz points out, \u201ccomes from the most marginalized communities in Puerto Rico. And so, the fact that Bad Bunny is receiving nominations in three main categories, and this is an artist who came up with trap \u2026 is the most groundbreaking thing about the entire situation.\u201d",
      "Petra Rivera-Rideau, associate professor of American studies at Wellesley College and co-author of \u201cP FKN R,\u201d says that element is particularly noteworthy because institutions often ignore marginalized genres \u2014 including at the Latin Grammys, a sister award show to the Grammys.",
      "A victory in the major categories could have \u201cprofound, symbolic meaning,\u201d she says. But with a caveat: \u201cI\u2019m interested to see if this is going to open doors for other people.\u201d After all, Bad Bunny himself isn't immune to the Recording Academy\u2019s institutional biases: He already has three career Grammys, but all have been in m\u00fasica urbana categories \u2014 despite the fact that he is the most streamed artist on the planet.",
      "Across \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos,\u201d Bad Bunny and his producers weave traditional Puerto Rican folkloric styles into a hyper-contemporary context. Latin trap and reggaet\u00f3n aren't abandoned but fused with m\u00fasica j\u00edbara, salsa, bomba, plena and even aguinaldo, a kind of Christmas music, in \u201cPitorro de Coco.\u201d While Bad Bunny\u2019s previous albums also fused different genres \u2014 including bossa nova, mambo, rock, merengue and more \u2014 this album\u2019s melange was more homegrown.",
      "Laguna sees \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d as a direct challenge to the prevailing \u201cformula for global pop stardom,\u201d which he describes as an artist making it locally, gaining traction and then \u201cwatering down\u201d their sound into something commercial and palatable for a global audience.",
      "\u201cBad Bunny went in the opposite direction. It\u2019s his most Puerto Rican album ever,\u201d says Laguna. He hopes it will communicate to other artists that they, too, can look to their ancestry and history for artmaking.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much amazing Latin music that has been overlooked and that\u2019s part of what is so beautiful about this moment,\u201d says D\u00edaz. \u201cAnd that's why it feels like a win for all Latinos.\u201d",
      "The timing of the album's release and recognition, too, feels consequential. \u201cThe U.S. has a history of othering Latinos, othering the Spanish language. \u2026 We\u2019re in a moment where that feels extremely acute,\u201d she continues. \u201cFor a community that is being targeted on such a deep level, it is a little bit of light, a little bit of faith that we can still carve out our place here.\u201d",

      "Latinos and the Spanish-speaking community in the U.S. have grown increasingly wary amid growing anti-immigrant sentiment and raids, as President Donald Trump\u2019s immigration policies and executive actions have vastly expanded who is eligible for deportation and routine hearings have turned into deportation traps for migrants.",
      "In an interview with i-D Magazine earlier this year, Bad Bunny mentioned that concerns around the mass deportations of Latinos factored into his decision not to tour in the continental U.S. ( Hundreds of people have been detained in Puerto Rico itself since large-scale arrests began in late January.)",
      "\u201cThe content of the lyrics \u2014 which are so steeped in the history of Puerto Rico, political histories, tourism and gentrification \u2014 there\u2019s so much rich political and historical content,\u201d D\u00edaz adds. \u201cThis album is historic even without a Grammy win.\u201d",
      "But if Bad Bunny does win, D\u00edaz says, it will be \u201cakin to Halle Berry being the first Black woman to win an Oscar. That was a watershed moment. Or Rita Moreno being the first Latina to win.\u201d",
      "Beyond that, Laguna says the politics of the album are not exclusive to Puerto Rican or even Latino identity \u2014 \u201cthe lyrics on this album align with global struggles,\u201d he says. Take, for example, \u201cLo que le pas\u00f3 a Hawaii\u201d (\u201cWhat happened to Hawaii\u201d), a rallying cry for cultural autonomy in an era of neocolonialization.",
      "Rivera-Rideau says one of the reasons \u201cDeb\u00ed Tirar M\u00e1s Fotos\u201d has resonated is not just the political implications of using folkloric music in addition to m\u00fasica urbana, but its sound. The traditional genres are \u201ca lot more digestible\u201d to listeners who embrace the antiquated taboos surrounding Latin trap and scoff at reggaet\u00f3n's sexuality. As a result, the combination of sounds makes for an album that is \u201cpopular across generations,\u201d she says.",
      "But it only works because it is \u201cmusically really interesting. If it was just traditional music, and that's only what people cared about, it wouldn't have done as well as it did,\u201d she explains. \u201cMusically, it is super innovative and makes accessible a lot of these older genres that people in Puerto Rico listen to, but he\u2019s been able to globalize these very local genres in a way that no one else has.\u201d",
      "That intergenerational appeal was a feature of Bad Bunny's landmark Puerto Rican residency, with the age and global diversity of its audience.",
      "\u201cA lot of people feel like this is a tense moment, it\u2019s a difficult moment. And here\u2019s someone giving us a sonic language in which to narrate this complex present,\u201d Laguna says. \u201cThere's pleasure, in political critique, that the music makes possible in a beautiful way. And I think that's very much welcomed.\u201d",

      "An official with the STC told The Associated Press on Saturday that more than 100 Saudi airstrikes struck multiple locations across Hadramout over the past 24 hours, resulting in deaths and injuries.

      "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) \u2014 Indonesia on Friday began enforcing its newly ratified penal code, replacing a Dutch-era criminal law that had governed the country for more than 80 years and marking a major shift in its legal landscape.",
      "Since proclaiming independence in 1945, the Southeast Asian country had continued to operate under a colonial framework widely criticized as outdated and misaligned with Indonesia\u2019s social values. Efforts to revise the code stalled for decades as lawmakers debated how to balance human rights, religious norms and local traditions in the world\u2019s most populous Muslim-majority nation.",
      "The 345-page Indonesian Penal Code, known as the KUHP, was passed in 2022. At the time, then-U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the U.S. was \u201cclosely monitoring the revised criminal code\u201d of its democratic partner.",

      "A parliamentary task force finalized the bill in November 2022 and lawmakers unanimously approved it a month later in what the government called a \u201chistoric step.\u201d",
      "The enforcement of the new penal code marks \u201cthe end of the colonial criminal law era and the beginning of a more humane, modern, and just legal system rooted in Indonesian culture,\u201d said Coordinating Minister for Law, Human Rights, Immigration, and Corrections Yusril Ihza Mahendra.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hollywood kicked off 2026 with \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d atop the box office for the third straight week and with hopes for a blockbuster-filled year after a disappointing 2025.",
      "In three weeks of release, \u201cFire and Ash\u201d has cleared $1 billion worldwide. The third chapter in James Cameron\u2019s Pandora epic collected $40 million over its third weekend in North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "\u201cFire and Ash\u201d is doing its biggest business overseas; it\u2019s grossed $777.1 million internationally thus far. The Walt Disney Co. on Sunday trumped the $1 billion milestone as \u201ccementing another monumental achievement for James Cameron\u2019s groundbreaking franchise.\u201d",
      "But over the holidays, it wasn\u2019t just about the weekend ticket sales. The whole week was a lucrative one for Hollywood, with most schools still out. What drove ticket sales, beyond \u201cAvatar\u201d? Sydney Sweeney, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and \u201cZootopia 2.\u201d",
      "The most sustained success over the holiday collider in theaters belonged to a movie that opened all the way back in November. Yet Disney\u2019s \u201cZootopia 2\u201d has had remarkable staying power. It landed in second place with $19 million, dipping a mere 4% from the previous weekend.",
      "The animated sequel has amassed $1.59 billion in six weeks. That makes \u201cZootopia 2\u201d Disney\u2019s second highest grossing animated movie ever, trailing only 2019\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d ($1.66 billion).",
      "\u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d the twisty thriller starring Sweeney and Amanda Seyfried, also emerged as a holiday-season hit for Lionsgate. It collected $14.9 million over the weekend, giving it $75.7 million domestically over three weeks. It dipped only 3% from last weekend. Internationally, \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d which cost a modest $35 million to make, has added $57.3 million.",
      "Just as Sweeney\u2019s star power is propelling \u201cThe Housemaid,\u201d so is Chalamet\u2019s with \u201cMarty Supreme.\u201d The A24 release also held well in its third weekend, grossing an estimated $12.6 million. After two weeks of wide release, Josh Safdie\u2019s frenetic table tennis tale has grossed $56 million in North America, passing the director\u2019s previous film, \u201cUncut Gems\u201d ($50 million worldwide).",
      "Just about everything playing in theaters saw small drops from the previous weekend. Sony\u2019s action comedy \u201cAnaconda,\u201d starring Jack Black and Paul Rudd, dipped 31% to collect $10 million in second weekend. Focus Features\u2019 \u201cSong Sung Blue\u201d dropped only 17% in its second weekend with $5.9 million. The Hugh Jackman-Kate Hudson Neil Diamond cover band movie has earned $25 million domestically.",
      "With \u201cAvatar: Fire and Ash\u201d and a wide variety of smaller hits, Hollywood started 2026 strongly. Overall sales were up 26.5% from the same weekend in 2025, according to data firm Comscore.",
      "The movie industry is coming off a poor 2025, where domestic moviegoing continued to slide. U.S. and Canada ticket sales in 2025 amounted to $8.9 billion, a 2% increase from the year earlier, according to Comscore, but about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. That slight improvement was notably less than anticipated and was also boosted by higher ticket prices. Actual tickets sold declined from more than 800 million in 2024 to around 780 million in 2025.",
      "The industry is now awaiting a potentially seismic shift with Warner Bros., one of the most theatrical-friendly studios, agreeing to sell to Netflix. That $83 billion deal awaits regulatory approval.",
      "Yet studios are cautiously optimistic 2026 could be the best box-office year of the decade. A release slate filled with marquee franchises, including new \u201cToy Story,\u201d \u201cAvengers,\u201d \u201cSpider-Man,\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros\u201d and \u201cDune\u201d movies, has raised hopes of a turnaround.",

      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Donald Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one\u2019s efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don\u2019t get their health insurance from an employer and don\u2019t qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns.",
      "\u201cIt really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\u201d said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly disappointed that there hasn\u2019t been more action.\u201d",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It\u2019s a strain for the 49-year-old but one he\u2019s willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker\u2019s monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",

      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she\u2019ll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her four-year-old daughter. She can\u2019t afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Trump\u2019s big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it\u2019s unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\u201cBoth Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\u201d said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \u201cThey need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\u201d",

But the historic milestone arrives amid political instability and skepticism among ordinary people fueled by fears of price rises.",
      "Supporters of switching to the euro from the old currency, the lev, are praising the move as one of the greatest achievements since the 1989 transition from a Soviet-style economy to democracy and free markets. They hope it will make the country more attractive for investors and strengthen its orientation toward wealthier Western Europe.",
      "But many people are uneasy, in a country where corruption is rife and trust in the authorities is low. One fear is that merchants will round prices up or otherwise use the changeover to worsen inflation, at a time when inflation has rebounded to 3.7%.",
      "An EU Eurobarometer poll from March showed that 53% of 1,017 people surveyed opposed joining the eurozone, while 45% were in favor. A separate Eurobarometer poll, taken between Oct. 9 and Nov. 3 on a similar sample, showed that about half of Bulgarians opposed the single currency while 42% were in favor. The margin of error was about plus or minus 3.1 percentage points for the March poll.",
      "The government successfully completed the euro adoption process by beating inflation down to 2.7% earlier this year to comply with EU rules and win approval from EU leaders. But clearing that hurdle was followed by a new chapter of political chaos. The government resigned after less than a year in office amid nationwide anti-corruption protests. This left the country without a regular budget for next year and is hampering plans for long-overdue structural reforms and decisions on use of EU support funds. A new election \u2014 the eighth in five years \u2014 is expected to be held next spring.",

      "Opponents of joining have fed fears that the changes will allegedly lead to more poverty and loss of national identity. Social media has spread disinformation such as false claims that the euro could lead to confiscation of bank accounts. Nationalist and pro-Russian groups exploit these fears.",
      "European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has said that countries have experienced a slight, transient rise in prices of 0.2%-0.4% right after joining.

      "Years after the downturn in the housing market began, Chinese developers are still struggling to regain their footing, despite a slew of government policies meant to revive the industry. Weak investment and housing prices have shaken investor confidence, spilling into the broader economy since millions of homeowners are stuck with apartments worth far less than what they paid for them.",
      "Instead of the huge driver of prosperity that it once was, the property market is weighing on the economy.",
      "Although Vanke's bondholders have approved extensions for repayments of its debt, the risk of a default remains.",
      "About a third-owned by Shenzhen Metro, a state-owned railway, publicly listed Vanke's finances are a mess. Its revenue fell 27% from a year earlier in the latest July-September quarter, and several of its onshore bonds were suspended from trading after prices plunged.",
      "The developer owes more than $50 billion, less than the more than $300 billion in debt racked up by China Evergrande, one of the first property dominos to fall when it defaulted in 2021 after the government cracked down on excessive borrowing in the industry.",
      "Analysts say Vanke, founded in the 1980s in the southern boomtown of Shenzhen, may be testing the limits of state support for property developers in reviving the industry, which once accounted for more than a quarter of total economic activities in China.",
      "More than four years after the downturn began, China\u2019s property sector has yet to recover. The situation varies from city to city, but overall home prices have fallen by 20% or more from their peak in 2021.",

      "Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffett this week",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- OMAHA, Neb. (AP) \u2014 Greg Abel faces the challenge of taking over Berkshire Hathaway from the legendary Warren Buffettthis week.",
      "Many regard Buffett as the world's greatest investor after he grew Berkshire from a struggling New England textile mill that he starting buying up for $7.60 a share in 1962, to the massive conglomerate it is today with shares that go for more than $750,000 a pop. Buffett's personal fortune of Berkshire stock is worth roughly $150 billion even after giving more than $60 billion away over the past 20 years.",
      "Berkshire for decades has routinely outpaced the S&P 500 as Buffett bought up insurance companies like Geico and National Indemnity, manufacturers like Iscar Metalworking, retail brands like Dairy Queen, major utilities and even one of the nation's biggest railroads, BNSF. Along the way, Buffett bought and sold hundreds of billions of dollars of stocks and profited handsomely from his famously long-term bets on companies like American Express, Coca-Cola and Apple.",
      "Berkshire has struggled to keep that pace in recent years because it has grown so huge and also struggled to find new and significant acquisitions. Even this fall's $9.7 billion acquisition of OxyChem probably isn't big enough to make a difference in Berkshire's profits.",
      "Investors will be watching closely to see what changes Abel might make in Berkshire's trajectory, but don't expect any seismic shifts.",
      "Buffett isn't going anywhere and Abel has already been managing all of Berkshire's noninsurance businesses since 2018. Buffett will remain chairman and plans to continue coming into the office each day to help spot new investments and offer Abel any advice he asks for.",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it is natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "But Berkshire operates under an extremely decentralized structure that trusts its executives with significant decisions. Everyone associated with the company has said there are no plans to change that.",
      "The world learned that Abel was to become the designated successor at Berkshire in 2021 when Buffett\u2019s longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, assured shareholders at an annual meeting that Abel would maintain the company\u2019s culture.",
      "Part of Buffett\u2019s sales pitch to company founders and CEOs thinking of selling their companies has always been that Berkshire would largely allow them to continue running their companies the same way as long as they delivered results.",
      "\u201cI think the investment community would likely applaud Greg\u2019s management style to the degree that it sort of buttons things up,\" Seifert said. \"And if it helps performance, that can\u2019t really be faulted.\u201d",

      "Abel has already shown himself to be a more hands-on manager than Buffett, but he still follows the Berkshire model of autonomy for acquired companies. Abel asks tough questions of company leaders and holds them accountable for their performance.",
      "Abel did announce some leadership changes earlier this month after investment manager and Geico CEO Todd Combs departed, and Chief Financial Officer Marc Hamburg announced his retirement. Abel also said he's appointing NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses. That essentially creates a third division of the company and takes some work off of Abel's plate. He will continue to manage the manufacturing, utility and railroad businesses.",
      "Abel will eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. From the beginning, Berkshire has held the position that it is better to reinvest profits rather than making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "But if Abel can\u2019t find a productive use of the $382 billion cash that Berkshire is sitting on, there may be a push from investors to start paying dividends or to adopt a traditional stock buyback program that would boost the value of shares they hold. Currently, Berkshire only repurchases shares when Buffett thinks they are a bargain, and he hasn't done that since early 2024.",
      "Still, Abel will be insulated from such pressure for some time since Buffett controls nearly 30% of the voting power in the stock. That will diminish gradually after his death as his children distribute his shares to charity as agreed.",
      "Many of Berkshire's subsidiaries tend to follow the economy and profit handsomely whenever the country is prosperous. Berkshire's utilities typically generate a reliable profit, and its insurance companies like Geico and General Reinsurance supply more than $175 billion worth of premiums that can be invested until claims come due.",
      "Investor Chris Ballard, who is managing director at Check Capital, said most of Berkshire's businesses \u201ccan almost take care of themselves.\" He sees a bright future for Berkshire under Abel.",
      "One of the biggest questions right now may be how much additional change there will be in company leadership after Combs' departure, if any at all. The head of the insurance unit, Vice Chairman Ajit Jain, who Buffett has long lavished with praise, is now 74 and many of the CEOs of the various companies have continued working long after retirement age because they like working for Buffett.",
      "\u201cAs a long-term shareholder, we aren\u2019t too concerned with Todd\u2019s departure and don\u2019t think this is the tip of some sort of iceberg,\" said Ballard, whose firm counts Berkshire as its largest holding. \"Todd\u2019s situation is unique. It\u2019s just a reminder that Warren\u2019s pending departure is imminent and they\u2019re preparing for a new phase \u2014 one that we\u2019re still excited to see unfold.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Chinese factory activity expanded for the first time in eight months in December, as orders picked up ahead of holidays and builders rushed to finish projects, according to surveys released Wednesday.",
      "The official purchasing managers index for manufacturing, a monthly survey of companies, rose to 50.1 this month, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. That was just above the 50 cut off for expansion versus contraction on a scale up to 100. Another, private sector, survey also was at 50.1 for December.",
      "The better-than-expected readings partly reflect easing pressure due to an extended truce in trade tensions with the U.S. They also suggest manufacturers ramped up production ahead of New Year holidays, when many companies close for days. China\u2019s Lunar New Year falls in mid-February this year.",
      "In comments to a new year's gathering carried Wednesday by China's state media, President Xi Jinping, vowed to promote \u201chigh-quality development\u201d and to carry out \u201cmore positive macroeconomic policies\u201d while ensuring social harmony and stability.",
      "The world's second largest economy is forecast to grow at a pace just below the official target of about 5% this year, supported by strong activity in high-tech industries and exports. The official PMI for high-tech manufacturing stood at 52.5 in December, up 2.4 percentage points from the previous month.",
      "The report said the PMIs for both equipment manufacturing and the consumer goods industry reached 50.4.",
      "The separate report by RatingDog, a Chinese credit research and analysis company based in the southern city of Shenzhen, said that despite an increase in overall orders, new export sales fell slightly and hiring weakened.",
      "\u201cOverall, the manufacturing sector regained growth at the end of 2025,\u201d RatingDog's founder Yao Yu said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the improvement was marginal, with the impact of promotions and new products appearing impulse-driven and their sustainability requiring observation.\u201d",

      "Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- Farmers are now learning how much aid they can expect to receive from a $12 billion package that President Donald Trump announced earlier this month.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture released the figures Wednesday for how much aid per acre farmers can plan on for each row crop. The details arrived after most farmers have already met with their bankers to arrange financing for next year's crops and placed orders for the seed and fertilizer they will need. But officials have promised that the payments should arrive by the end of February.",
      "Soybean farmers have been hit especially hard by Trump's trade war with China, which stopped buying any American crops after Trump announced his tariffs this spring. China is the world's largest buyer of soybeans. This aid package is expected to help farmers weather the trade disruptions until China buys more soybeans under an agreement announced in October and until provisions of Trump's massive budget bill take effect later this year.",
      "Soybean farmers will get $30.88 per acre while corn farmers will receive $44.36. Another crop hit hard when China stopped buying was sorghum, and those farmers will get $48.11 per acre. The amounts are based on a USDA formula on the cost of production.",
      "But farmers say the aid won't solve all their problems as they continue to deal with the soaring costs of fertilizer, seeds and labor that make it hard to turn a profit right now. Some agricultural trade groups have said they worry that thousands of farmers could go out of business, but others have said they believe most farmers have the financial resources and equity needed to survive.",
      "Kentucky soybean farmer Caleb Ragland, who was president of the American Soybean Association until recently, said the aid is \u201ca Band-Aid on a deep wound. We need competition and opportunities in the market to make our future brighter.\u201d",
      "Most farmers remain steadfast supporters of Trump even after the disruptions caused by the trade war. They generally support many of his other policies and believe they will get a better trade deal in the end.",

      "After Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea in October, the White House said Beijing had promised to buy at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans by the end of the calendar year, plus 25 million metric tons a year in each of the next three years. Officials have said China is on track to meet the 12 million metric ton goal by the end of February, but so far China has only purchased about 4.3 million metric tons of soybeans, according to the latest USDA figures.",
      "Beijing has yet to confirm any commitment to buying 12 million metric tons of soybeans for this season, but the Chinese embassy in Washington said earlier this month that \u201cagricultural trade cooperation between China and the United States is proceeding in an orderly manner.\u201d",
      "The aid payments will be capped at $155,000 per farmer or entity, and only farms that make less than $900,000 in adjusted gross income will be eligible. During the first Trump administration, a number of large farms found ways around the payment limits and collected millions.",
      "The USDA said it would use a formula that estimates production costs to come up with a per-acre payment for each type of crop. The USDA says the average size of the 1.88 million farms nationwide was 466 acres last year, but many farmers are much larger than that as larger operations have continued to buy up neighboring farms over time.",

      "MANHATTAN, Kan. -- About the fourth or fifth time that A.J. Dybantsa crashed to the floor, and he looked up at an official in both shock and vain, one of the most talented freshmen in college basketball must have finally figured out that he wasn't going to get a call.",
      "Welcome to life in the Big 12 Conference.",
      "Dybantsa still poured in 24 points while leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 victory over Kansas State on Saturday, the first true road game for the Cougars all season. But he did it while committing seven turnovers and showing visible frustration throughout much of the first half, a learning experience if ever there was one for the potential No. 1 pick in next year's NBA draft.",
      "\u201cDefinitely,\u201d Dybantsa said, \u201ccoach was telling me it was going to be more physical than our nonconference games.\u201d",
      "Few leagues are as rough-and-tumble as the Big 12, but it's also worth pointing out that Dybantsa doesn't even turn 19 until later this month, and the swingman could just as well be playing his senior season of high school; he reclassified to this year's freshman class a couple of years ago, when it already was clear that Dybantsa's game \u2014 if not his physique \u2014 was ready for the big time.",
      "Even Dybantsa acknowledged Saturday the need to spend some more time in the weight room.",
      "Kansas State did everything it could to muddy up the game, rotating an exhausting number of bodies onto the 6-foot-9 forward, who found himself in a bit of foul trouble because of it. BYU coach Kevin Young wound up sitting Dybantsa for a few minutes \u2014 a move that he typically does not make \u2014 not only to keep him from picking up another foul but to give him a chance to reset.",
      "\u201cI trust all our guys in that situation,\u201d Young said, \u201cbut him in particular, I trust him in terms of his IQ for the game.\u201d",
      "The nation's second-leading scorer, Dybantsa was coming off perhaps the best performance of his young career, when he scored 33 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists against Eastern Washington. It was only the second 30-10-10 triple-double in the history of the Big 12, and it was a performance that underscored that the McDonald's All-American is much more than just a scorer.",
      "Against the Wildcats, Dybantsa complemented his 24 points with eight rebounds and three assists.",
      "The Cougars needed all of them, too, because P.J. Haggerty answered Dybantsa nearly bucket for bucket for Kansas State. The nation's No. 3 scorer, Haggerty scored 24 points with seven rebounds and six assists.",

And that highlighted the difference between a first-year player and a fourth-year junior, both in terms of their physicality and high-level college experience.",
      "\u201cThose are two really good players out there,\u201d said Kansas State coach Jerome Tang, who recruited Dybantsa heavily before losing out on him to BYU. \u201cI thought they matched their stat lines. It was just one of those things.\u201d",
      "The difference in the game itself was their supporting casts. Dybantsa got 18 points from Robert Wright III and big games from Richie Saunders and Keba Keita, while Haggerty's best wingman \u2014 Abdi Bashir Jr. \u2014 was largely shut out in the second half.",
      "\u201cYou know, I've been watching A.J. since he was in the seventh grade. Loved him and his family. Had a great time recruiting him,\" Tang said. \u201cI've watched his games this season, and he's been one of the most efficient players. He was very efficient again.\u201d",

      "With his fifth catch on Sunday against the rival Green Bay Packers, a simple hitch route he turned into a 17-yard gain, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver hit the four-digit mark for the sixth consecutive year. Jefferson immediately received a loud ovation from the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd.",

This was by far his most difficult season, with the Vikings offense frequently struggling in the early developmental process for quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who also missed seven games because of injuries.",

      "Scientists from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University have created the first three-dimensional image of the Popocat\u00e9petl volcano's interior",
      "POPOCAT\u00c9PETL VOLCANO, Mexico -- In the predawn darkness, a team of scientists climbs the slope of Mexico's Popocat\u00e9petl volcano, one of the world\u2019s most active and whose eruption could affect millions of people. Its mission: figure out what is happening under the crater.",
      "For five years, the group from Mexico\u2019s National Autonomous University has climbed the volcano with kilos of equipment, risked data loss due to bad weather or a volcanic explosion and used artificial intelligence to analyze the seismic data. Now, the team has created the first three-dimensional image of the 17,883-foot (5,452-meter) volcano\u2019s interior, which tells them where the magma accumulates and will help them better understand its activity, and, eventually, help authorities better react to eruptions.",
      "Marco Cal\u00f2, professor in the UNAM's Geophysics Institute\u2019s vulcanology department and the project leader, invited The Associated Press to accompany the team on its most recent expedition, the last before its research on the volcano will be published.",
      "Inside an active volcano, everything is moving: the rocks, magma, gas and aquifers. It all generates seismic signals.",
      "Most of the world\u2019s volcanoes that pose a risk to humans already have detailed maps of their interiors, but not Popocat\u00e9petl, despite the fact that some 25 million people live within a 62-mile (100 kilometers) radius and houses, schools, hospitals and five airports could be affected by an eruption.",
      "Other scientists took some early images 15 years ago, but they showed contradictory results and did not have sufficient resolution to see \u201chow the volcanic edifice was being built,\u201d and above all, where the magma gathered, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "His team increased the number of seismographs from the 12 provided by Mexico\u2019s National Disaster Prevention Center to 22 to cover the entire perimeter of the volcano. Even though just three can alert to an emergency, many more are needed to understand what is behind those emergencies.",
      "The devices measure vibrations in the ground 100 times per second and generate data that Karina Bernal, 33, a doctoral student and researcher on the project, processed by using artificial intelligence to adapt algorithms developed for other volcanoes.",
      "\u201cI taught the machine about the different types of tremors there are in El Popo\u201d and with that they were able to catalog the different kinds of seismic signals, she said.",
      "Little by little the scientists began to infer what kinds of material were where, in what state, at what temperature and at what depth. Later they were able to map it.",
      "The result is far more complex than the drawings of volcanoes most saw in school, with a main vent connecting a chamber of magma with the surface.",
      "This first three-dimensional cross-sectional image goes 11 miles (18 kilometers) below the crater and shows what appear to be various pools of magma at different depths, with rock or other material between them and more numerous toward the southeast of the crater.",
      "Popocat\u00e9petl emerged in the crater of other volcanoes in its current form more than 20,000 years ago and has been active since 1994, spewing plumes of smoke, gas and ash more or less daily. The activity periodically forms a dome over the main vent, which eventually collapses, causing an eruption. The last was in 2023.",
      "Cal\u00f2, a 46-year-old Sicilian, speaks passionately about El Popo, as Mexicans call the volcano, rattling off trivia.",
      "He explains that its height can change because of eruptions and recounts how Popocat\u00e9petl, in the first century, had its own \u201clittle Pompeii\u201d when a village on its flanks, Tetimpa, was buried in ash. In the early 20th century, it was human actions \u2014 using dynamite to extract sulfur from the crater \u2014 that provoked an eruption. And even though El Popo emanates more greenhouse gases than almost any other volcano, its emissions are still a small fraction of what humans generate in nearby Mexico City.",
      "For years Cal\u00f2 studied volcanic activity from his computer, but trying to \u201cunderstand how something works without touching it\u201d spurred a feeling of disappointment, he said.",
      "That changed with Popocat\u00e9petl, a volcano he describes as \u201cmajestic.\u201d",

      "A short distance higher on the mountain, the trees and scrub give way to ash and sediment.",
      "They must cross a lahar, a mixture of rock and ash that during the rainy season becomes a dangerous mudflow carrying away everything in its path.

      "Popocat\u00e9petl\u2019s sounds seem to multiply at night with the echoes. An explosion like a rocket might sound like it\u2019s coming from one direction, but a puff of smoke from the crater belies the real source.",
      "Karina Rodr\u00edguez, a 26-year-old master\u2019s student on the team, said you can also hear small tremors in the earth or even ash falling like rain when the volcano is more active. On dark nights, the rim of the crater glows orange.",
      "Having direct knowledge of the volcano provides a much more objective sense of the limits of their analysis, Cal\u00f2 said.",
      "\u201cWe have a natural laboratory here,\u201d he said. It\u2019s \u201cvery important to be able to understand and give residents detailed, trustworthy information about what is happening inside the volcano.\u201d",
      "At 13,780 feet (4,200 meters), their backpacks full of computers, equipment to analyze gases, batteries and water begin to weigh more and their pace slows.",
      "Ash, dark and warm, dominates the landscape here.",
      "At a seismographic station, the team digs up the equipment and celebrates that it\u2019s still working. They download its data and rebury it.",
      "A \u201cvolcanic bomb,\u201d a rock a yard and a half in diameter and weighing tons, marks the way and gives an idea of what the start of an eruption can mean. That is why the top area of the volcano is restricted, though not everyone pays heed. In 2022, a person died after being hit by a rock about 300 yards (meters) from the crater.",
      "A bottle of tequila near a rocky hollow, known as El Popo\u2019s belly button, hints at some of the traditions surrounding the volcano, including an annual pilgrimage to what some consider a point of connection to the underworld.",
      "Digging up one of the last seismic stations, Cal\u00f2\u2019s face falls. The last registered data are from months earlier. The battery died. Sometimes rats chew the machines\u2019 wires or an explosion causes more serious damage.",
      "The project has yielded some certainties and if repeated will allow the analysis of changes that eventually will help authorities make better decisions when eruptions occur.",
      "But Cal\u00f2 says that, as always happens with science, it has also generated new questions that they will have to try to address, like why the tremors are more frequent on the southeast side \u2014 where there is more accumulated magma \u2014 and what implications that could have.",
      "This was the last expedition before their years of work to map the volcano\u2019s interior is published. Watching the volcano\u2019s interior move in 3D on a computer screen makes all of the effort worthwhile.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s what drives you to start another project and keep climbing,\u201d Rodr\u00edguez, the master's student, said.",

      "Maduro landed Saturday evening at a small airport in New York following the middle-of-the-night operation that extracted him and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their home in a military base in the capital city of Caracas \u2014 an act that Maduro's government called \u201cimperialist.\u201d The couple faces U.S. charges of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy.",
      "The dramatic action capped an intensive Trump administration pressure campaign on Venezuela's autocratic leader and months of secret planning, resulting in the most assertive American action to achieve regime change since the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Legal experts raised questions about the lawfulness of the operation, which was done without congressional approval. Venezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, meanwhile, demanded that the United States free Maduro and called him the country\u2019s rightful leader as her nation's high court named her interim president.",

      "Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on narco-terrorism conspiracy charges, and the Justice Department released a new indictment Saturday of Maduro and his wife that painted his administration as a \u201ccorrupt, illegitimate government\u201d fueled by a drug-trafficking operation that flooded the U.S with cocaine. The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro as the country's leader.",
      "The Trump administration spent months building up American forces in the region and carrying out attacks on boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean for allegedly ferrying drugs.

      "Taking place 36 years to the day after the 1990 surrender and seizure of Panama leader Manuel Antonio Noriega following a U.S. invasion, the Venezuela operation unfolded under the cover of darkness early Saturday. Trump said the U.S. turned off \u201calmost all of the lights\" in Caracas while forces moved in to extract Maduro and his wife.",
      "Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said U.S. forces had rehearsed their maneuvers for months, learning everything about Maduro \u2014 where he was and what he ate, as well as details of his pets and his clothes.",

      "Multiple explosions rang out that morning, and low-flying aircraft swept through Caracas. Maduro's government accused the United States of hitting civilian and military installations, calling it an \u201cimperialist attack\u201d and urging citizens to take to the streets. The explosions \u2014 at least seven blasts \u2014 sent people rushing into the streets, while others took to social media to report what they saw and heard.",

      "\u201cThe Altadena I know and love is gone,\u201d Dowd-Figueroa said, referring to the suburb devastated by the fire. \u201cEverything burned down \u2014 my dentist, my pharmacy \u2014 all of it\u2019s gone. But there\u2019s still something about Altadena that feels like Altadena now, even though there are no homes.\u201d",

      "Dowd-Figueroa and her family had lived in the four-bedroom, three-bath house for 10 years. It was the longest she\u2019d ever lived in one place, and the sense of loss left her stricken by waves of sadness.",
      "For months, she would drive to the empty lot and cry. Her grief and shock deepened when she realized that, in addition to her late grandmother\u2019s artwork that was in her home, her father\u2019s ashes were gone forever.",

      "President Donald Trump's plan to take control of Venezuela's oil industry and ask American companies to revitalize it after capturing President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in a raid isn't likely to have a significant immediate impact on oil prices.",
      "Venezuela's oil industry is in disrepair after years of neglect and international sanctions, so it could take years and major investments before production can increase dramatically. But some analysts are optimistic that Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day to return to historic levels fairly quickly.",
      "\u201cWhile many are reporting Venezuela\u2019s oil infrastructure was unharmed by U.S. military actions, it has been decaying for many many years and will take time to rebuild,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, who is the lead petroleum analyst at gasoline price tracker GasBuddy.",
      "American oil companies will want a stable regime in the country before they are willing to invest heavily, and the political picture remained uncertain Saturday with Trump saying that the United States is in charge, while the current Venezuelan vice president argued, before Venezuela\u2019s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, that Maduro should be restored to power.",
      "\u201cBut if it seems like the U.S. is successful in running the country for the next 24 hours, I would say there would be a lot of optimism that U.S. energy companies could come in and revitalize the Venezuelan oil industry fairly quickly,\u201d said Phil Flynn, a senior market analyst at the Price Futures Group.",
      "And if Venezuela can grow into an oil production powerhouse, Flynn said \u201cthat could cement lower prices for the longer term\u201d and put more pressure on Russia.",
      "Oil isn't traded over the weekend, so there wasn't an immediate impact on prices. But a major shift in prices isn't expected when the market does reopen. Venezuela is a member of OPEC so its production is already accounted for there. And there is currently a surplus of oil on the global market.",
      "Venezuela is known to have the world's largest proven crude oil reserves of approximately 303 billion barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. That accounts for roughly 17% of all global oil reserves.",
      "So international oil companies have reason to be interested in Venezuela. Leading companies, including Exxon Mobil and Chevron, didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment Saturday. ConocoPhillips spokesperson Dennis Nuss said by email that the company \u201cis monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability. It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\u201d",
      "Chevron is the only one with significant operations in Venezuela, where it produces about 250,000 barrels a day. Chevron, which first invested in Venezuela in the 1920s, does business in the country through joint ventures with the state-owned company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela S.A., commonly known as PDVSA.",
      "But even with those massive reserves, Venezuela has been producing less than 1% of the world's crude oil supply. Corruption, mismanagement and U.S. economic sanctions saw production steadily decline from the 3.5 million barrels per day pumped in 1999 to today's levels.",
      "The problem isn't finding the oil. It's a question of the political environment and whether companies can count on the government to live up to their contracts. Back in 2007, then President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized much of the oil production and forced major players like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips out.",
      "\u201cThe issue is not just that the infrastructure is in bad shape, but it\u2019s mostly about how do you get foreign companies to start pouring money in before they have a clear perspective on the political stability, the contract situation and the like,\u201d said Francisco Monaldi, who is the director of the Latin American energy program at Rice University.",

      "Venezuela produces the kind of heavy crude oil that's needed for diesel fuel, asphalt and other fuels for heavy equipment. Diesel is in short supply around the world because of the sanctions on oil from Venezuela and Russia and because America's lighter crude oil can't easily replace it.",
      "Years ago, American refineries on the Gulf Coast were optimized to handle that kind of heavy crude at a time when U.S. oil production was falling and Venezuelan and Mexican crude was plentiful. So refineries would love to have more access to Venezuela's crude because it would help them operate more efficiently, and it tends to be a little cheaper.",
      "Boosting Venezuelan production could also make it easier to put pressure on Russia because Europe and the rest of the world could get more of the diesel and heavy oil they need from Venezuela and stop buying from Russia.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been a big benefit for Russia to see Venezuela\u2019s oil industry collapse. And the reason is because they were a competitor on the global stage for that oil market,\u201d Flynn said.",

      "Five years after the Capitol riot, some of the police officers who fought off the rioters that day say they're still struggling with what happened",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Donald Trump was inaugurated for the second time on Jan. 20, 2025, former Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell put his phone on \u201cdo not disturb\u201d and left it on his nightstand to take a break from the news.",
      "That evening, after Gonell spent time with family and took his dog on a long walk, his phone started to blow up with calls. He had messages from federal prosecutors, FBI agents and the federal Bureau of Prisons \u2014 all letting him know that the new president had just pardoned about 1,500 people who had been convicted for their actions at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The pardons included rioters who had injured Gonell as he and other officers tried to protect the building.",
      "\u201cThey told me that people I testified against were being released from prison,\u201d Gonell said. \u201cAnd to be mindful.\u201d",
      "Gonell was one of the officers who defended the central West Front entrance to the Capitol that day as Congress was certifying Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s victory and hundreds of Trump\u2019s supporters broke into the building, echoing his false claims of a stolen election. Gonell was dragged into the crowd by his shoulder straps as he tried to fight people off. He almost suffocated. In court, he testified about injuries to his shoulder and foot that still bother him to this day.",
      "\u201cThey have tried to erase what I did\u201d with the pardons and other attempts to play down the violent attack, Gonell said. \u201cI lost my career, my health, and I\u2019ve been trying to get my life back.\u201d",
      "Five years since the siege, Gonell and some of the other police officers who fought off the rioters are still coming to terms with what happened, especially after Trump was decisively elected to a second term last year and granted those pardons. Their struggle has been compounded by statements from the Republican president and some GOP lawmakers in Congress minimizing the violence that the officers encountered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year,\u201d said Officer Daniel Hodges, a Metropolitan Police Department officer who was also injured as he fought near Gonell in a tunnel on the West Front. Hodges was attacked several times, crushed by the rioters between heavy doors and beaten in the head as he screamed for help.",
      "\u201cA lot of things are getting worse,\u201d Hodges said.",
      "More than 140 police officers were injured during the fighting on Jan. 6, which turned increasingly brutal as the hours wore on.",
      "Former Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger took over the department six months after the riot. He said in a recent interview that many of his officers were angry when he first arrived, not only because of injuries they suffered but also \u201cthey resented the fact that they didn\u2019t have the equipment they needed, the training they needed \u201d to deal with the unexpectedly violent crowd.",
      "Several officers who fought the rioters told The Associated Press that the hardest thing to deal with has been the effort by many to play down the violence, despite a massive trove of video and photographic evidence documenting the carnage.",
      "Trump has called the rioters he pardoned, including those who were most violent toward the police, \u201cpatriots\u201d and \u201chostages.\u201d He called their convictions for harming the officers and breaking into the building \u201ca grave national injustice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that was wrong,\u201d Adam Eveland, a former District of Columbia police officer, said of Trump\u2019s pardons. If there were to be pardons, Eveland said, Trump's administration should have reviewed every case.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had a hard time processing that,\u201d said Eveland, who fought the rioters and helped to push them off the Capitol grounds.",
      "The pardons \u201cerased what little justice there was,\u201d said former Capitol Police Officer Winston Pingeon, who was part of the force\u2019s Civil Disturbance Unit on Jan. 6. He left the force several months afterward.",
      "Hodges and Gonell have been speaking out about their experiences since July 2021, when they testified before the Democratic-led House committee that investigated Jan 6. Since then, they have received support but also backlash.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to wrap my head around that, but ideology is a pretty powerful thing,\u201d he said.",
      "As police officers struggled in the aftermath, Manger, the former Capitol Police chief, said the department had to figure out how to better support them. There were no wellness or counseling services when he arrived, he said, and they were put in to place.",
      "\u201cThe officers who were there and were in the fight \u2014 we needed to make sure that they got the help that they needed,\u201d Manger said.",
      "Manger, who retired in May, also oversaw major improvements to the department\u2019s training, equipment, operational planning and intelligence. He said the Capitol is now \u201ca great deal safer\u201d than it was when he arrived.",
      "\u201cIf that exact same thing happened again, they would have never breached the building, they would have never gotten inside, they would have never disrupted the electoral count,\u201d Manger said.",
      "Pingeon, the former Capitol Police officer, said he believes the department is in many ways \u201cunrecognizable\u201d from what it was on Jan. 6 and when he left several months later.",
      "\u201cIt was a wake-up call,\u201d he said.",
      "Pingeon, who was attacked and knocked to the ground as he tried to prevent people from entering the Capitol, said Jan. 6 was part of the reason he left the department and moved home to Massachusetts. He has dealt with his experience by painting images of the Capitol and his time there, as well as advocating for nonviolence. He said he now feels ready to forgive.",
      "\u201cThe real trauma and heartache and everything I endured because of these events, I want to move past it,\u201d he said.",
      "Gonell left the Capitol Police because of his injuries. He has not returned to service, though he hopes to work again. He wrote a book about his experience, and he said he still has post-traumatic stress disorder related to the attack.",
      "While many of the officers who were there have stayed quiet about their experiences, Eveland said he decided that it was important to talk publicly about Jan. 6 to try to reach people and \u201ccome at it from a logical standpoint.\u201d",
      "Still, he said, \u201cI\u2019ve had to come to terms with the fact that just because something happened to me and was a major part of my world doesn\u2019t mean that everyone else has to understand that or even be sympathetic to that.\u201d",
      "He added: \u201cThe only thing I can do is tell my story, and hopefully the people who respect me will eventually listen.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- A newly unsealed U.S. Justice Department indictment accuses captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro of running a \u201ccorrupt, illegitimate government\u201d fueled by an extensive drug-trafficking operation that flooded the U.S. with thousands of tons of cocaine.",
      "The arrest of Maduro and his wife in a stunning military operation early Saturday in Venezuela sets the stage for a major test for U.S. prosecutors as they seek to secure a conviction in a Manhattan courtroom against the longtime leader of the oil-rich South American nation.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a post on X that Maduro and his wife \u201cwill soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts.\u201d",
      "Here's a look at the accusations against Maduro and the charges he faces.",
      "Maduro is charged alongside his wife, his son and three others. Maduro is indicted on four counts: narco-terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, possession of machine guns and destructive devices and conspiracy to possess machine guns and destructive devices.",
      "Maduro is facing the same charges as in an earlier indictment brought against him in Manhattan federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency. The new indictment unsealed on Saturday, which adds charges against Maduro's wife, was filed under seal in the Southern District of New York just before Christmas.",
      "It was not immediately clear when Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, would make their first appearance at the courthouse in Manhattan. A video posted Saturday night on social media by a White House account showed Maduro, smiling, as he was escorted through a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration office in New York by two federal agents grasping his arms. He was expected to be detained while awaiting trial at a federal jail in Brooklyn.",
      "The indictment accuses Maduro of partnering with \u201csome of the most violent and prolific drug traffickers and narco-terrorists in the world\u201d to allow for the shipment of thousands of tons of cocaine into the U.S. Authorities allege powerful and violent drug-trafficking organizations, such as the Sinaloa Cartel and Tren de Aragua gang, worked directly with the Venezuelan government and then sent profits to high-ranking officials who helped and protected them in exchange.",
      "Maduro allowed \u201ccocaine-fueled corruption to flourish for his own benefit, for the benefit of members of his ruling regime, and for the benefit of his family members,\u201d the indictment alleges.",
      "U.S. authorities allege that Maduro and his family \u201cprovided law enforcement cover and logistical support\u201d to cartels moving drugs throughout the region, resulting in as much as 250 tons of cocaine trafficked through Venezuela annually by 2020, according to the indictment. Drugs were moved on go-fast vessels, fishing boats and container ships or on planes from clandestine airstrips, the indictment says.",
      "\u201cThis cycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\u201d the indictment says.",

      "Presidents often find solace in golfing, and Joint Base Andrews in Maryland is a favorite spot because it's close to the White House and has built-in security",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Donald Trump has spent much of his two-week vacation in Florida golfing. But when he gets back to the White House, there's a military golf course that he's never played that he's eyeing for a major construction project.",
      "Long a favored getaway for presidents seeking a few hours\u2019 solace from the stress of running the free world, the Courses at Andrews \u2014 inside the secure confines of Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, about 15 miles (24 kilometers) from the White House \u2014 are known as the \u201cpresident's golf course.\" Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Joe Biden have spent time there, and Barack Obama played it more frequently than any president, roughly 110 times in eight years.",
      "Trump has always preferred the golf courses his family owns \u2014 spending about one of every four days of his second term at one of them. But he's now enlisted golf champion Jack Nicklaus as the architect to overhaul the Courses at Andrews.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that an individual has time to take a couple hours away from the world crises. And they\u2019re people like everybody else,\u201d said Michael Thomas, the former general manager of the course, who has golfed with many of the presidents visiting Andrews over the years.",
      "Andrews, better known as the home of Air Force One, has two 18-hole courses and a 9-hole one. Its facilities have undergone renovations in the past, including in 2018, when Congress approved funding to replace aging presidential aircraft and to build a new hanger and support facilities. That project was close enough to the courses that they had to be altered then, too.",
      "Trump toured the base by helicopter before Thanksgiving with Nicklaus, who has designed top courses the world over. The president called Andrews \u201ca great place, that\u2019s been destroyed over the years, through lack of maintenance.\u201d",
      "Other golfers, though, describe Andrews\u2019 grounds as in good shape, despite some dry patches. Online reviews praise the course's mature trees, tricky roughs, and ponds and streams that serve as water hazards. The courses are mostly flat, but afford views of the surrounding base.",
      "The first president to golf at Andrews was Ford in 1974. Thomas began working there a couple years later, and was general manager from 1981 until he retired in 2019.",
      "He said the Secret Service over the years used as many as 28 golf carts \u2014 as well as the president's usual 30-car motorcade \u2014 to keep the perimeter secure.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a Cecil B. DeMille production every time,\u201d said Thomas, who had the opportunity to play rounds with four different presidents, and with Biden when he was vice president.",
      "He said the commanders in chief generally enjoyed their time out on the course in their own unique ways, but \u201cthey all like to drive the cart because they never get an opportunity to drive.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like getting your driver\u2019s license all over again,\" Thomas laughed.",
      "Trump golfs most weekends, and as of Jan. 1, has spent an estimated 92 days of his second term doing so, according to an Associated Press analysis of his schedules.",
      "That tally includes days when Trump was playing courses his family owns in Virginia, around 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the White House, and near his Florida estate Mar-a-Lago, where he's spending the winter holidays. It also includes 10 days Trump spent staying at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where his schedule allowed time for rounds of golf.",
      "Trump has visited Andrews in the past, but the White House and base have no record of him playing the courses.",
      "Andrews\u2019 military history dates to the Civil War, when Union troops used a church near Camp Springs, Maryland, as sleeping quarters. Its golf course opened in 1960.",

      "The White House said the renovation will be the most significant in the history of Andrews. The courses and clubhouse need improvements due to age and wear, it said, and there are discussions about including a multifunctional event center as part of the project.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is a champion-level golfer with an extraordinary eye for detail and design,\" White House spokesman Davis Ingle said in a statement. \"His vision to renovate and beautify Joint Base Andrews' golf courses will bring much-needed improvements that servicemembers and their families will be able to enjoy for generations to come.\u201d",
      "Plans are in the very early stages, and the cost of \u2014 and funding for \u2014 the project haven't been determined, the White House said. Trump has said only that it will require \u201cvery little money.\"",
      "The Andrews improvements join a bevy of Trump construction projects, including demolishing the White House\u2019s East Wing for a sprawling ballroom now expected to cost $400 million, redoing the bathroom attached to the Lincoln bedroom and replacing the Rose Garden\u2019s lawn with a Mar-a-Lago-like patio area.",
      "Outside the White House, Trump has led building projects at the Kennedy Center and wants to erect a Paris-style arch near the Lincoln Memorial, and has said he wants to rebuild Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia.",
      "On Wednesday, meanwhile, the Trump administration ended a lease agreement with a non-profit for three public golf courses in Washington \u2014 which could allow the president to further shape golfing in the nation's capital. The White House, however, said that move isn't related to the plans for Andrews.",
      "When the president is golfing, Andrews officials block off nine holes at a time so no one plays in front of him, allowing for extra security while also ensuring consistent speed-of-play, Thomas said.",
      "That's relatively easily done given that the courses aren't open to the public. They're usually reserved for active or retired members of the military and their families, as well as some Defense Department-linked federal employees.",
      "Thomas remembers playing a round with the older President Bush, a World Golf Hall of Fame inductee known for fast play, while first lady Barbara Bush walked with Millie, the first couple\u2019s English Springer Spaniel. George W. Bush also played fast, Thomas said, and got additional exercise by frequently riding his mountain bike before golfing.",
      "When he wasn't golfing at Andrews, Obama tried to recreate at least part of the experience back home. He had a White House golf simulator installed after then-first lady Michelle Obama asked Thomas how they might acquire a model that the president had seen advertised on the Golf Channel. Thomas gave her a contact at the network.",
      "Obama famously cut short a round at Andrews after nine holes in 2011 to hustle back to the White House for what turned out to be a top-secret review of final preparations for a Navy Seal raid on the compound of Osama Bin Laden.",
      "But, while Thomas was golfing with presidents, he said he never witnessed play interrupted by an important call or any major emergency that forced them off the course mid-hole. There also were never any rain-outs.",
      "\u201cIf there was rain coming, they\u2019d get the weather forecast before we would,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThey would cancel quick on that.\u201d",

      "The announcement earlier this week by the Trump administration that it would freeze child care funds to Minnesota and the rest of the states comes after a series of fraud cases involving government programs in which many defendants were Somali, as were many of those running spotlighted childcare centers.",
      "Allegations of fraud at the child care centers went viral recently when a right-wing influencer posted a video claiming there was fraud taking place, putting Minnesota and some other states in the crosshairs of the Trump administration.",
      "State officials said investigators did spot checks and reviews of nine centers this week in response to the influencer's video posted last week, and found no operational issues. One center was not yet open at the time, and there are ongoing investigations at four of them.",
      "The email sent Friday instructed providers and families who rely on the frozen federal child care program to continue the program\u2019s \u201clicensing and certification requirements and practices as usual.\u201d It does not say that recipients themselves need to take any action or provide any information.",
      "\u201cWe recognize the alarm and questions this has raised,\u201d the email said. \u201cWe found out about the freezing of funds at the same time everyone else did on social media.\u201d",
      "The state agency added that it \u201cdid not receive a formal communication from the federal government until late Tuesday night,\u201d which was after Health and Human Services Deputy Secretary Jim O\u2019Neill posted about the freeze on X.

      "Search efforts began Tuesday afternoon after the military notified the Coast Guard that survivors were in the water about 400 miles (650 kilometers) southwest of the border between Mexico and Guatemala, the maritime service said in a statement.",
      "The Coast Guard dispatched a plane from Sacramento to search an area covering more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), while issuing an urgent warning to ships nearby. The agency said it coordinated more than 65 hours of search efforts, working with other countries as well as civilian ships and boats in the area.",
      "The weather during that time has included 9-foot seas and 40-knot winds. The U.S. has not said how many people jumped into the water, and, if they are not found, how far the death toll may rise from the Trump administration's monthslong campaign of blowing up small boats accused of transporting drugs in the region.",
      "The U.S. military said earlier this week that it attacked three boats traveling along known narco-trafficking routes and they \u201chad transferred narcotics between the three vessels prior to the strikes.\u201d The military did not provide evidence to back up the claim.",
      "U.S. Southern Command, which oversees the region, said three people were killed when the first boat was struck, while people in the other two boats jumped overboard and distanced themselves from the vessels before they were attacked.",
      "The strikes occurred in a part of the eastern Pacific where the Navy doesn\u2019t have any ships operating. Southern Command said it immediately notified the U.S. Coast Guard to activate search and rescue efforts for the people who jumped overboard before the other boats were hit.",

      "President Donald Trump has invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi to visit the United States this year",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump invited Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi during a phone call Friday to visit the United States this year, the Japanese foreign ministry said, in what would be the ultraconservative leader's first trip to the U.S. since taking office in October.",
      "The White House is yet to confirm the call and the invitation. It comes as ties between Japan and China have been strained, ramping up tensions in the region. The U.S., a close ally of Japan, is seeking to strengthen its ties with Tokyo but also stabilize its relationship with Beijing ahead of a likely trip by Trump to China in April.",
      "Beijing staged two-day military exercises in the waters off Taiwan this week. Takaichi, Japan's first female prime minister, infuriated China late last year when she said Chinese military action against Taiwan could be grounds for a Japanese military response, breaking away from former Japanese leaders\u2019 strategic ambiguity on the highly sensitive matter.",
      "In a statement Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said Takaichi and Trump agreed to coordinate for the visit to happen this spring. Kyodo News, Japan's news agency, suggested that Takaichi's trip could coincide with the annual cherry blossom festival in Washington.",
      "The foreign ministry said the two leaders affirmed that they would \u201ccarve out a new chapter in the history of the Japan-U.S. alliance\u201d in a year when the U.S. celebrates the 250th anniversary of its founding and that they would \u201cfurther deepen the friendly relations\u201d between the two nations, including economic and security cooperation.",
      "Takaichi and Trump also agreed on their commitment to promoting cooperation among like-minded partners, including the Japan-U.S.-South Korea partnership, and to a free and open Indo-Pacific, the foreign ministry statement said.",
      "The two exchanged views \u201cmainly on the Indo-Pacific region,\" the ministry said, but it did not provide details, including whether the two discussed recent actions by Beijing in the region.",

      "Now one of the first officers on the scene is about to stand trial on multiple charges of child abandonment and endangerment. Former Uvalde schools police officer Adrian Gonzales is accused of ignoring his training in a crisis with deadly consequences. His attorney insists he was focused on helping children escape from the building.",
      "The trial that starts Monday offers potentially one of the last chances to see police answer for the long delay. The families have pinned their hopes on the jury after their gun-control efforts were rejected by lawmakers, and their lawsuits remain unresolved. A few parents ran for political office to seek change, with mixed results.",
      "The proceedings will provide a rare example of an officer being criminally charged with not doing more to stop a crime and protect lives.",
      "Jesse Rizo's niece was one of 19 children and two teachers killed by the teenage gunman in one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history. Nine-year-old Jackie Cazares still had a pulse when rescuers finally reached her, Rizo said.",

    "story": [
      "Beginning in the 1960s, medical dramas became a staple of primetime TV. You may have followed the trials and tribulations of Doctors James Kildare, Marcus Welby, Hawkeye Pierce, Mark Craig, Michaela Quinn, and then, in 1994, \"ER\"'s Dr. John Carter, played by Noah Wyle.",
      "Wyle says that, when \"ER\" ended, the odds that someday he'd do another medical show were \"zero percent.\"",
      "So, what changed? \"COVID,\" he said. \"COVID changed everything, certainly for me in thinking about there being another story to tell. I was getting a lot of mail from people on the frontlines saying,'We could sure use Dr. Carter out here.' Or, 'This is really awful.'\"",
      "For his work on \"ER,\" Wyle was nominated as best supporting actor five times \u2026 and finally took home an Emmy this past September, when he received the trophy as outstanding lead actor in a drama series for his portrayal of Dr. Michael Robinavitch \u2013 Dr. Robby \u2013 on \"The Pitt.\" The hit HBO Max medical series won five Emmys in all, including outstanding drama series.",
      "And Season 2 is about to begin.",
      "Dr. Robby watches over the controlled chaos at the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center. It all takes place over a single emergency room shift, and each episode covers just one hour in a very long day.",
      "A few months ago, \"Sunday Morning\" visited the set at the Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank, California. Walk from backstage into the emergency room, and you feel you are in an actual hospital.",
      "Wyle said, \"It became really important to have the entire set feel like a totally immersive experience. You open a drawer, everything that's supposed to be in the drawer is there. Everything feels real, and is exactly where it should go.\"",
      "Wyle is in charge here in more ways than one. Not only is he a lead actor; he's an executive producer and writer. And on the days we dropped in, he also directed.",
      "Actors at \"The Pitt\" have to learn more than their lines. There's a two-week medical boot camp. Dr. Elizabeth Ferreira, herself an emergency room doctor, is one of the show's medical technical consultants: \"We try our best to educate them on CPR, how to suture, how to intubate, the natural mechanics, so that when they are on screen and the camera is quite tight and close, everything looks finessed and refined, as if someone with experience has done it.\"",
      "She helps make sure the procedures look thoroughly real, as in Episode 10, involving a patient who'd been slugged in the eye by a baseball. She helps make sure the procedures \u2013 and the prosthetics \u2013 look thoroughly real.",
      "That hyper-authenticity extends to the storylines, as when a nurse is punched by a patient. Executive producers John Wells said, \"Since COVID, there's a kind of a stress level and anger that exists in the population. And that has translated particularly to violence against nurses, but against all the healthcare providers [as well].\"",
      "Wells and fellow executive producer Scott Gemmill \u2013 both veterans of the series \"ER\" \u2013 said \"The Pitt\" also addresses the issue of loss of trust that the public has in public health. \"Disinformation, that was one of the biggest changes, I think, besides COVID,\" Gemmill said. \"I don't remember the disinformation being at a level that it is these days.\"",
      "Wells said, \"The biggest thing that we talk about regularly is Dr. Google \u2013 this notion that everybody who comes in is already on their phone figuring out what it is that supposedly is wrong with them, and half the people have assumed that they've got the worst possible thing that could happen to them. And that's part of what the erosion of trust is. You're defending yourself against artificial intelligence and what's going to happen next.\"",
      "\"The Pitt\"'s second season will continue to reflect real life and real problems. Wyle said, \"People are going to lose their health insurance. People are going to delay care. People are going to continue to come in sicker. They're going to be more volatile when they come in. That's going to put more of a burden on staff. All this stuff is sort of moving towards this perfect storm of unsustainability.\"",
      "Wyle's connection to the medical community is more than what's in a script: his mother, Marjorie Speer, was an orthopedic and operating room nurse. \"Mom's at the hospital all day, I got to walk home from school until mom gets home,\" Wyle said. \"And then 35 years later, she's watching an episode of 'The Pitt,' and comes over and says, 'That rocked me.' She just starts listing all these names of patients that she had seen die when she was practicing. I said, 'Mom, I've never heard these stories before.' And she goes, 'Oh, yeah.' We were her kids, and she didn't show us that stuff.\"",
      "But \"The Pitt\" does show us that stuff, and what happens when an empathetic doctor stops having empathy for himself.",
      "\"You know, in the old days, it was kind of 'suck it up,' and it was a little bit of like, 'I went through it, so you got to go through it,' you know? This is your training,\" Wyle said.",
      "\"We were up for four days straight!\" I said.",
      "\"Yeah! And it became a badge of honor to survive it.\"",
      "Gemmill said, \"We get feedback from people who, having seen the show, realize that they, too, are suffering and have buried it the same way that the Robby character did.\"",
      "Which brings us to Dr. Robinavitch's meltdown. \"Everything is going crazy. We need the hero to come in on his white horse and save the day,\" Wyle said. \"He's on the floor! \u00a0The hero's on the floor? How can that be?\"",
      "So, three decades after \"ER,\" Noah Wyle is once again playing a dedicated doctor \u2013 and as it turns out, it's a prescription he wrote for himself. \"There were two points in my career. during the pandemic and during this last work stoppage for the writers and actors' strike, those were the two moments when the flow of my career [was] interrupted, and I wasn't used to it,\" he said. \"It really rattled me in a way that \u2026 that rattled me. I remember saying to my wife, like, 'I don't think I work for money. I think I work for health, my own health. Like, I think this is where I get my orientation. And without it, I'm not sure I know what I do on this Earth.'\"",
      "And now? \u00a0\"I'm the happiest I've been in a long time,\" he said.",
      "I asked, \"Does that surprise you?\"",
      "\"It just confirms, you know, it confirms all my worst suspicions about myself, which is that I really need all this!\" Wyle laughed.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/michael-b-jordan-on-sinners/",
    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 10:16:22 -0500",
    "summary": "Michael B. Jordan, who plays twin brothers in \"Sinners,\" says shooting Ryan Coogler's horror film set in the Depression Era South \u2013 a drama that melds Jim Crow racism with vampires \u2013 is also a testament to the power of family.",
    "story": [
      "It's not much of a stretch to say that Michael B. Jordan has fought his way to the top. His performances are often game-changing \u2013 as a boxing champ (in \"Creed\"), a Marvel superhero (in \"Fantastic Four\"), or a Marvel villain (in \"Black Panther\").",
      "But his latest film required a different kind of superpower: In Ryan Coogler's \"Sinners,\" Jordan plays twin brothers, Stack and Smoke, who open a backwoods honkytonk in the segregated South.",
      "When Coogler shared the idea of him playing two different characters, Jordan says his reaction was, \"'I'm a do what?' I think it was a little bit of anxiety, I think. A little bit nerves. But then, equal amount of excitement.\"",
      "And it gets really exciting when vampires show up. \"Sinners\" is a horror film, but it's also about history, and the power of family ties.",
      "To play characters from the Jim Crow South, Jordan drew a bit from his own family history. Relatives on his mother's side hail from Hope, Arkansas, but years ago moved to a segregated Black neighborhood in Los Angeles called Oakwood (a place that is now Venice Beach).",
      "We visited the First Baptist Church of Venice, which was the center of their community, and one of the only remnants still standing. Jordan, who moved to New Jersey as a toddler, never went to this place of worship, but he says he can still feel the connection to his family's past. \"I grew up in church, you know, very spiritual family,\" he said. \"Churches were, like, safe havens \u2013 places of prayer and refuge \u2026 The history, I mean, you can feel the weight when you walk into a place like this.\"",
      "I asked, \"Did shooting 'Sinners' make you think about your own family history more?\"",
      "\"Big time,\" he replied. \"It definitely connected me back to my family's history that I've always had a strong connection with, but it just kind of reframed it a bit.\"",
      "His own history is remarkable as well: Dad is a U.S. Marine veteran; mom is a former high school counselor; and Michael Bakari Jordan was a child model, then a child star. He was still in high school when he was cast in the landmark series \"The Wire,\" and a few years later in another landmark show, \"Friday Night Lights.\"",
      "He said, \"There's nobody in my family that came from this, I guess, that looked at it as a potential career, you know? I think once I didn't go to college and I decided to move to California and pursue acting full-time, there was, like, there was no turning back after that one.\"",
      "His film breakout came in 2013 in director Ryan Coogler's drama \"Fruitvale Station.\"",
      "FROM THE ARCHIVES: Michael B. Jordan, Ryan Coogler on \"Fruitvale Station\" (YouTube Video)",
      "Jordan worked with Coogler again a few years later when he climbed into the ring for 2015's \"Creed,\" a spin-off of the \"Rocky\" franchise \u2013 and, by the way, the first Rocky film where Sylvester Stallone didn't have top billing.",
      "Jordan said, \"Doing 'Creed,' so many different levels. The first time I transform my body, you know, learned a skill that I continue to do today, you know?\"",
      "\"You still box?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah, it's a part of me at this point,\" he said.",
      "And this character of Erik Killmonger, the bad guy in \"Black Panther\" who tried to dethrone the hero played by the late Chadwick Boseman, stuck with him, too, but not in a good way. He says it was hard to shake Erik. \"Yes, it kind of stuck with me for a bit. And, you know, went to therapy and talked about it. Found a way to kind of just decompress, I think at that point still learning that I needed to decompress from a character.\"",
      "\"So, you literally went to therapy to help rid yourself a little bit of Erik?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah. And then I think that spiraled into a bigger conversation and self-discovery of, like, 'Okay, you know, I think that's something that's necessary for people, you know?' Especially men. I think it's good for them to go and talk. That's something I'm not ashamed of at all, and very proud of. And definitely helped me trying to be a good communicator and a well-rounded person, inside and out.\"",
      "For Jordan, now 38, part of being well-rounded is a strong relationship with mom and dad. He even continued to live with his parents up until well after he could afford to move out on his own. \"This is true,\" he said.",
      "Why? \"I mean, 'cause I love my parents. You know, I love them. Made for a lotta funny moments, lotta great stories.\"",
      "Like? \u00a0\"Y'all ain't got enough time!\" he laughed. \"I'm a night owl, you know? Like, just things, you know? They go to sleep early. Insert moment here.\"",
      "We should mention Jordan bought them a house of their own in the L.A. suburbs; he just lived there for a while.",
      "\"Who doesn't want to buy your parents a house, you know, your mom a house? It's like, that's always been the childhood dream, is to retire your parents and them not having to work anymore,\" he said. \"And I can say I did that. So that's, like, yeah, that's a bucket list.\"",
      "\"Sinners\" is squarely in the Oscar conversation, both for the film and for Jordan's performance. It's a welcome distinction for someone who lived his early life under the shadow of another famous Michael.",
      "\"You grew up playing sports, right?\" I asked. \"Was the name Michael Jordan a problem?\"",
      "\"Big time!\" he said. \"I got teased so much, to the point where I almost changed my name.\"",
      "He was going to lean on his middle name: Bakari Jordan. \"It definitely made me want to be competitive and be good at \u2013 I wanted to be great at something, if not for nothing else at that time just to, like, feel like I had my own identity,\" he said.",
      "I said, \"But there could be another Michael Jordan who could make his mark.\"",
      "\"Correct,\" said Jordan. \"That was a part of the alchemy that made me who I am today.\"",
      "Put it this way: Michael Bakari Jordan could be on his way to his own brand of immortality \u2013 after all, Bakari means \"noble promise.\"",
      "I asked, \"Do you feel like you've fulfilled that?\"",
      "\"I feel like I'm walking in that,\" Jordan replied, \"and will continue to do so, big time. We got a lot more things to do, you know? We're just getting started.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Environmental journalist Tatiana Schlossberg (May 5, 1990-Dec. 30, 2025), a grandchild of President John F. Kennedy, worked as a reporter for The New York Times' Science section, and was author of the award-winning 2019 book, \"Inconspicuous Consumption: The Environmental Impact You Don't Know You Have.\"",
      "In a November 2025 essay in The New Yorker, titled \"A Battle With My Blood,\" she wrote of how her life changed, shockingly, upon the birth of her second child in May 2024 at age 34. Hours after giving birth, Schlossberg's doctors noticed a spike in her white-blood-cell count. She was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia with a rare mutation, mostly seen in older people. \"I wasn't sick. I didn't feel sick. I was actually one of the healthiest people I knew,\" she wrote.",
      "The daughter of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg, she recounted in her essay going through rounds of chemotherapy and two stem cell transplants and participating in clinical trials. During the most recent trial, she wrote, her doctor told her \"he could keep me alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good,\" she wrote, \"to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life, and there's nothing I can do to stop it.\"",
      "In her essay, Schlossberg criticized her mother's cousin, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., for pushing policies (including slashing nearly $500 million for research into mRNA vaccines against certain cancers) that could impact patients like her. She also wrote movingly of her family's support, and of the valiant efforts of medical staff to help her. \"I have never encountered a group of people who are more competent, more  full of grace and empathy, more willing to serve others than nurses,\" she wrote. \"Nurses should take over.\"",
      "She feared her daughter and son wouldn't remember her, and mourned the life and work she would not experience \u2013 from watching her children grow up, to writing a book about the oceans.",
      "\"Mostly, I try to live and be with them now. But being in the present is harder than it sounds, so I let the memories come and go,\" she wrote. \"So many of them are from my childhood that I feel as if I'm watching myself and my kids grow up at the same time. Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead. Obviously, I won't. But since I don't know what death is like and there's no one to tell me what comes after it, I'll keep pretending. I will keep trying to remember.\""

      "When a work's copyright protections lapse, it lands in the public domain, allowing anyone to use and build upon it as they see fit for free and without needing permission.",
      "\"Copyright gives rights to creators and their descendants that provide incentives to create,\" Jennifer Jenkins, director of Duke University's Center for the Study of the Public Domain, told CBS News' Lee Cowan in 2024. \"But the public domain really is the soil for future creativity.\"",
      "The U.S. Constitution's intellectual property clause establishes that works be protected for a limited amount of time, \"to promote the progress of science and useful arts.\" The Founding Fathers left it to Congress to sort out the specifics.",
      "Generally, in the U.S., works published or registered before 1978 retain copyright protections for 95 years. For later works, protection usually spans the creator's lifetime and 70 years after.",
      "\"If copyright lasted forever, it would be very difficult for a lot of creators to make the works they want to make without worrying about being in the crosshairs of a copyright lawsuit,\" Jenkins said.",
      "Just because a work's copyright has expired does not mean that members of the public cannot be held legally liable in some instances. For example, while the original Betty Boop from 1930 is in the public domain, the modern version is not. So to avoid infringement, any reuse would need to steer clear of her newer characteristics.

    "story": [
      "Actor George Clooney and his wife Amal Clooney were\u00a0granted French citizenship\u00a0because \"they contribute, through their distinguished actions, to France's international influence and cultural outreach,\" the French government said Wednesday, defending their naturalization that was questioned by a junior French minister.",
      "The naturalizations of the Kentucky-born star of the \"Ocean's\" series of heist movies, his wife and human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, and their twins Ella and Alexander were announced last weekend in the Journal Officiel, where French government decrees are published.",
      "Marie-Pierre Vedrenne, a junior minister at the Interior Ministry, expressed misgivings Wednesday that some of the Clooneys' new French compatriots may think that the star couple was granted special treatment. The actor speaks only what he himself says is \"horrible, horrible\" French.",
      "\"The message being sent is not good,\" Vedrenne said in an interview with broadcaster France Info. \"There is an issue of fairness that, in my eyes, is absolutely essential.\"",
      "President Trump piled on the criticism against the move, saying France was welcome to the two-time Academy Award winner, a long-time vocal critic of the U.S. leader.",
      "\"Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social on Wednesday.",
      "He added, \"Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies. He wasn't a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The couple purchased an estate in France in 2021 and Clooney has said that it's their primary residence. Non-French residents of France have multiple possible routes to becoming naturalized. It wasn't clear whether the 64-year-old actor retained his American citizenship. His 47-year-old wife was born in Lebanon and raised in the U.K and naturalized by France under her maiden name, Amal Alamuddin. The 8-year-old twins were born in London.",
      "The Foreign Ministry said the Clooneys were eligible for citizenship under a French law that allows for the naturalization of foreign nationals who contribute to France's international influence and economic well-being.",
      "It argued that France's cinema industry will benefit from the actor's clout as a global movie star and said that as a lawyer, Amal Clooney regularly works with academic institutions and international organizations in France.",
      "\"They maintain strong personal, professional and family ties with our country,\" the ministry said.",
      "\"Like many French citizens, we are delighted to welcome Georges and Amal Clooney into the national community,\" it concluded, giving the actor's first name a French twist by adding the \"s\" at the end.",
      "The decision was also defended by Vedrenne's superior at the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Laurent Nu\u00f1ez, who said he signed the naturalization decree.",
      "\"It's a big chance for our country,\" he said.",
      "In recent media interviews, when he was promoting \"Jay Kelly,\" Clooney said that he is trying to teach himself French using a language-learning app. He said that his wife and children speak the language perfectly.",
      "\"They speak French in front of me so that they can say terrible things about me to my face and I don't know,\" he joked, speaking to French\u00a0broadcaster Canal+.",
      "French media have reported that the Clooneys live part-time in their luxury 18th-century villa outside the town of Brignoles in southern France, where they can keep a lower profile and their children are protected from unauthorized photographs by French privacy laws.",
      "In an interview with Esquire in October, Clooney said: \"I was worried about raising our kids in L.A., in the culture of Hollywood.\"",
      "\"I don't want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don't want them being compared to somebody else's famous kids,\" he said. Growing up away from the spotlight in France, \"they have dinner with grown-ups and have to take their dishes in. They have a much better life.\"",

    "summary": "In his new wellness book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream,\" Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel goes beyond the basics of eating, exercise and sleep, to the importance of being happy, social engagement, and recommended behaviors (like \"don't be a schmuck\") that can benefit longevity.",
    "story": [
      "It may not sound like a New Year's resolution, but Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel is serving up some unusual advice as you start out 2026: Eat your ice cream. \"Ice cream will make you happy, and that's very important,\" he explained.",
      "I asked, \"Why would I live longer eating ice cream?\"",
      "\"Ice cream is a good dairy product; it's got protein, its saturated fats are in a globule, so it doesn't affect you as much as saturated fats in meats and other things,\" he said. \"Plus, you typically do it socially with someone else. And you know, being happy is a very important part of living a long time.\"",
      "\"I feel like your saying 'eat your ice cream' is like 'Don't stress out as much about life. Be more social,'\" I said.",
      "\"We're here for only 75, 85, 90 years. You've got to make life enjoyable. You've got to make it fulfilling,\" he said.",
      "The prominent oncologist and health policy expert is taking a different approach in his new wellness book, called,\u00a0\"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.). He said, \"I want people to stop obsessing. make it part of your life. You should like exercising, you should like eating well. Otherwise, you're not going to do it for years and years and decades, which is what's necessary for a long, healthy life.\"",
      "The doctor's health handbook does include the basics of what to eat, how to exercise, and the all-important reminder that sleep is fundamental to wellness. But it goes beyond that, with behaviors that include \"Don't be a schmuck.\"",
      "\"One of the things that is I think core to the book is, stop doing things that aren't good for your health,\" Emanuel said. \"'Don't be a schmuck' is my father's reference to us when we were being stupid. And so, there are lots of things that we do as human beings that can be schmucky: smoking, vaping, doing drugs, not taking your vaccines. I don't agree with the current administration, and they're dead wrong on this.\"",
      "Also on the so-called schmuck list: alcohol.",
      "I asked, \"This is what everybody wants to know about: the right amount of alcohol, or no alcohol?\"",
      "Emanuel said, \"There has been a lot of research on alcohol, so here's the way I distill it: The safest level is probably zero. There are some studies, and we should be clear, where it's half a cup a day, three cups a week.\"",
      "\"Nobody drinks a half a glass of wine,\" I said.",
      "\"So, you drink every other day,\" Emanuel said. \"On the other hand, 60, 65% of the public drinks. You're not going from 65% to zero. So, you have to give people reasonable advice. And the reasonable advice is, first of all, no binge drinking, that's really bad for you. Don't drink alone. That's really bad for you. If you're using alcohol as a lubricant for social interaction, which many people do, that's probably good; you're getting some benefit from the social interaction.\"",
      "Social interactions \u2013 a consistent theme for Emanuel \u2013 is something he learned at a young age, growing up with brother Ari, a super-agent in Hollywood, and his other brother Rahm, the former mayor of Chicago and ambassador, who may be running for president of the United States.",
      "I asked, \"What is it that your parents taught all of you that has led you, I mean, you're all incredibly successful?\"",
      "\"Now you're gonna make me cry,\" Emanuel said, \"because every time I talk about my parents and our growing up, I tend to cry. They taught us how to be social and interact with people. They also taught us how to be responsible. One of the things my mom did in raising us is, you know, get out of the house and go occupy yourself. Rahm and I went to school, I was six in first grade, and he was in nursery school. I had to take him from school, walk two blocks across a busy street, get on a bus, pay the car fare, get off at the right spot. I learned a huge amount of responsibility, taking care of my brothers.",
      "\"The other thing I think they did, which was super-important for us, is we all slept in the same bedroom. We were a unit. Yes, we fought endlessly. And you know, I like to joke with people, we didn't go to bed until there was blood, you know, because of all the fights. But we were also each other's best friends.\"",
      "His takeaway: relationships matter.",
      "Emanuel also lists lifestyle choices he considers \"anti-wellness,\" like chronic stress, a fast-food diet, social media, and dining alone.",
      "\"I think people would agree with all of those, with the exception of dining alone,\" I said. \"A lot of people go to a restaurant or get home from work, and dine alone.\"",
      "Emanuel said that should be an occasional thing: \"Don't make it every day. And you know, if you find yourself dining alone, what you should do is call up a friend. If you're sitting at a bar, right, and you're dining there, ask the person next to you, you know, 'Have you been to this restaurant before? What do you do? Why are you here?' Yeah, strike up a conversation. We underplay those casual conversations and how important they are for us.\"",
      "His book also discusses retirement: \"Retirement leads to more rapid cognitive decline for people. I say to people, don't retire. And if you're gonna retire, you have to plan retirement well, so that you stay engaged, you stay mentally sharp. And that doesn't mean, 'Well, you know, I'm gonna try to play the saxophone one day.'\"",
      "\"But Dr. Emanuel, a lot of retired people like to buy books, and watch 'Sunday Morning,'\" I said.",
      "\"Well, if they're buying books and staying mentally engaged that way, if they're going to volunteer, say, or they're talking to friends, or they're taking up a new hobby seriously, all of that is excellent, highly endorsed,\" he replied.",
      "\"Meaning don't retire the mind, or retire your social engagement?\"",
      "\"Yes, and it's very important, you've got to be deliberate about it. You can't let nature take its course.\"",
      "So, what is his biggest piece of advice for us in 2026? \"Build your social relationships,\" he said. \"It's definitely the most important thing for long-lasting health and happiness.\"",

      "In his new book, \"Eat Your Ice Cream: Six Simple Rules For a Long and Healthy Life\" (to be published Tuesday by W.W. Norton & Co.), Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, an oncologist and health policy expert, discusses longevity, and how to best differentiate valid and effective health and wellness advice from \"the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid.\"",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Emanuel on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" January 4!",
      "\"Eat Your Ice Cream\" by Ezekiel J. Emanuel, M.D.",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Anyone looking for advice on wellness and longevity confronts a tsunami of books, newspaper articles, podcasts, newsletters, and videos from an enormous range of sources: scientific experts, medical practitioners, health systems, journalists, patients, influencers, gurus, quacks. Traditional media offer loads of good advice, often in responsibly edited and well-sourced sections dedicated to \"wellness.\" But the sheer amount of it can be difficult to keep up with, and sometimes the guidance can be downright contradictory.",
      "For anyone wading through the torrent of health and longevity advice online, it can be difficult to know who to trust. The so-called \"must dos\" online range from the medically unproven to the wildly impractical to suggestions so absurd they leave doctors like me baffled\u2014testicle tanning, teen blood transfusions, vaginal steaming, \"rucking\" hikes with a backpack full of weights. Information is coming at us from a firehose, increasingly spewed by hucksters and self-proclaimed sages who have amassed millions of social media followers (and dollars) by promising supposed miracle treatments using medical-sounding language. It's no wonder so many people are confused and frustrated.",
      "Shouting to be heard over it all are real physicians and health experts offering sound but sometimes conflicting advice. All of it together can swamp even those who are most assiduous about their health. Dozens of books on health and longevity have appeared in just the last few years, filled with well-intentioned and scientifically accurate information. But too often they fall into the trap of chasing novelty instead of efficacy and end up touting treatments and regimens that are unproven or with marginal returns at best.",
      "Then there is the steady stream of profiles on tech billionaires joylessly devoting themselves to maximizing their lifespan. One of my business school students told me how her \"wellness coach\" recommended all sorts of questionable prescriptions, like eating 200 grams of meat a day. (Don't ask me why a perfectly healthy twentysomething student who isn't training for a marathon or Ironman needs a wellness coach.) And then there is the entrepreneur attempting to defy death with his daily regimen of 100 pills, cold plunges, infrared lights, and a daily serving of \"nutty pudding\"\u2014a mix of chia seeds, macadamia nuts, and berries. Nutty is right.",
      "With so much health and wellness advice out there, it can be nearly impossible to differentiate the valid, reliable, and effective from the speculative, deceptive, and just plain stupid. Even when the advice is scientifically sound, it's often extraneous, misrepresented, or misused. For example, one wellness book ventures into the basic biology of molecular pathways, like the mTOR pathway for cell survival, to explain why you should take rapamycin to improve longevity. Indeed, studies have shown rapamycin extends the lifespan of mice, worms, flies, and yeast. But you are not a mouse, worm, fly, or yeast. While some studies have suggested that rapamycin for humans may mitigate the impact of aging-related immune and cardiovascular diseases, there is no evidence that it impacts human lifespans.",
      "This extrapolation of laboratory findings parallels the story of resveratrol, the \"magic\" compound in grapes and red wine that was supposed to explain the French paradox. Yes, resveratrol improved longevity in mice. But, do you have a tail and whiskers? Scientists have been experimenting on mice since the early 20th century, and while this work has led to many breakthroughs, findings in mice often fail to extend to humans. As an oncologist, I know that researchers have cured hundreds of thousands of mice with cancer using experimental chemotherapy agents, only to have the drugs fail when administered to people with cancer. Unfortunately, there's no evidence that resveratrol or rapamycin improves human lifespans. Ultimately, the biology lesson and the \"health advice\" is a waste of people's time.",
      "What so many of these talking heads have in common\u2014legitimate experts, well-meaning journalists, and kooks alike\u2014is how costly their recommendations are. Financially, for sure, but also costs in mental energy and time that steal from activities which give life meaning. With the mountain of advice out there, it is practically a full-time job to determine whether the information on rapamycin is accurate, not to mention if it is worth taking.",
      "Overall, the wellness industrial complex promises us more time to enjoy in the future\u2014but sure is demanding a lot of time right now. It takes a ton of time and attention to pore through a 400-page book, much less a whole library of them. And what about the zillions of posts, videos, and articles about the latest new supplement, superfood, or exercise that supposedly can lengthen your life? Add that to the time spent trying to figure out what is real versus what is a fad. Or based on some microbes in a petri dish or a study of worms. Or worse yet, based on no evidence at all. Then budget more time to methodically organize your schedule to incorporate the latest exercise tweak or diet advice. . . . Congratulations: You have now lost that added time the gurus promised you. And you've lost it in the prime of your life.",
      "Of course, if your whole focus is on quantity of years rather than quality, this work could be worth it. Some \"longevity experts\" seem to see things that way. As one popular author says, \"Our only goal is to live longer and live better\u2014to outlive.\" Our only goal? Life is not a competition where the gold medal goes to the oldest! Our goal should not be to \"outlive\" as many people as possible. Instead, the goal should be to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Wellness is just a means to that end, not the end in itself.",

      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",

      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming.

    "published": "Fri, 02 Jan 2026 16:57:53 -0500",
    "summary": "Proposed California ballot initiative would impose a one-time 5% tax on billionaires, with the revenue funneled toward health care and education.",
    "story": [
      "A proposed billionaire wealth tax in California is sparking debate over whether the measure, if passed, would lead to more harm than good if ultrawealthy residents in the state flee to other locales.",
      "Under the proposed ballot initiative, California would institute a one-time tax of 5% on the state's estimated 255 billionaires. While wealth taxes aren't new, the proposal has sparked pushback from some of America's richest citizens and their allies, who claim it could drive the state's billionaires to leave the state and discourage entrepreneurs from creating businesses.",
      "By contrast, advocates of the tax emphasize that billionaires' fortunes are growing much faster than the income of ordinary Americans.",
      "\"The billionaire class had their wealth nearly triple in the last six years, and a one-time wealth tax will only put a 5% constraint on their wealth accumulation,\" Omar Ocampo, a researcher at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies, told CBS News. \"It will not significantly impact their lives, their consumption or spending habits.\"",
      "Others warn that California could face a revenue shortfall if the state's wealthiest residents \u2014 who already pay relatively high tax rates \u2014 decamp for other states to avoid the tax.",
      "Gov. Gavin Newsom has previously opposed earlier wealth tax proposals in the state, saying that the idea is \"going nowhere in California,\" while billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, a New York resident, spoke out against the California proposal in a December 29 social media\u00a0post.",
      "\"I am opposed to wealth taxes because they effectively represent an expropriation of private property and have many unintended and negative consequences that have occurred in every country that has launched such a tax,\" Ackman wrote.",
      "Here's what to know about the proposed California billionaire tax and its potential economic impact.",
      "What is the billionaire wealth tax?",
      "The billionaire wealth tax is a\u00a0proposed ballot measure created by the Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West (SEIU-UHW), a union representing more than 120,000 health care workers and patients in California.",
      "If passed, the measure would levy a one-time 5% tax on the wealth of the state's billionaires, although it would not tax their income. According to California's attorney general, the tax would be applied to assets including:",

      "Securities such as stocks and bonds",
      "Art",
      "Collectibles",
      "Intellectual property",
      "Real estate and some pensions and retirement accounts also would be excluded from the tax.",
      "If voters pass the initiative, billionaires in the state would have to pay the tax in 2027, although they could opt to spread the payments across five years for an additional annual nondeductible charge of 7.5% of the remaining unpaid balance, according to the text of the proposal.",
      "How would the tax revenue be used?",
      "About 90 cents of every $1 raised by the tax would be spent on health care, while the remaining 10 cents would be earmarked for food assistance or education, the proposal states.",
      "According to the SEIU-UHW, the impetus for the billionaire tax stems from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, which includes about $1 trillion in spending cuts over the next decade to Medicaid, the health care program for low-income Americans. Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, is slated to lose $190 billion in funding over the next decade due to those cuts, according to the proposal.",
      "\"The purpose of the 2026 Billionaire Tax Act ... is to protect access to high-quality, equitable health care, and to support funding for kindergarten through grade fourteen public education and food assistance programs, by raising revenue from a one-time tax on billionaire wealth,\" the proposal states.",
      "How much money could the billionaire tax raise for California?",
      "California would likely raise \"tens of billions of dollars from the wealth tax,\" according to a Dec. 11 analysis\u00a0by the state's nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office.",
      "However, the group noted that quantifying the exact amount potentially raised by the tax is difficult because it's unclear what actions billionaires might take to reduce their tax burden, and because much of their wealth is based on stock prices, which continuously fluctuate, the analysis noted.",
      "What steps are needed to pass the wealth tax?",
      "First, the measure needs to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, with Ballotpedia putting the number at about 875,000. If it draws sufficient public support, the measure would appear on the state's ballot in the November general election.",
      "Once on the ballot, the measure would pass if it received a majority approval.",
      "Do the rich move when facing wealth taxes?",
      "Some critics of wealth taxes contend that such policies drive rich Americans to move to low-tax states. Yet\u00a0previous research has found that millionaires generally don't relocate just to get a tax cut.",
      "Massachusetts offers a recent example. The state introduced a 4% tax on millionaires in 2023, with the new revenue helping fund free school lunch for the state's schoolchildren. While some millionaires may have left to avoid the tax, a\u00a0May analysis from the Institute for Policy Studies found that the number of millionaires in Massachusetts rose nearly 39% in the two years after the tax took effect.",
      "Have any billionaires announced plans to move over the California tax proposal?",
      "It is unclear whether a one-time tax on billionaires, with their much deeper bank accounts, could spur an exodus in the state. Critics of the proposal have noted that tech billionaire Peter Thiel announced on Dec. 31 that his private investment firm, Thiel Capital, has opened a Miami office.",
      "The new location \"will complement Thiel Capital's existing operations in Los Angeles, California,\" according to the statement, which didn't mention the California proposal.",
      "Craft Ventures, a venture capital firm co-founded in 2017 by billionaire tech investor David Sacks\u00a0said on December 31 that it had opened a new office in Austin, Texas. The firm added that Sacks, who also serves as a White House adviser on AI and cryptocurrency, had relocated to Austin earlier that month, although it didn't mention the proposed wealth tax.

    "summary": "Abel, 63, takes the helm of Berkshire Hathaway after a six-decade run by Buffett.",
    "story": [
      "Warren Buffett officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway on Thursday, handing the reins of the multinational conglomerate to his hand-picked successor, Greg Abel.",
      "Abel, 63, is taking the helm of Berkshire after Buffett, 95, spent six decades transforming a struggling textile manufacturer into one of the world's most successful companies. As the new CEO, Abel will be tasked with upholding Berkshire's decentralized model \u2014 one of the company's hallmarks \u2014 while guiding it into a new era of growth.",
      "In recent years, that growth has slowed as the company has ballooned in size, making it harder to find large, meaningful acquisition targets.",
      "Buffett tapped Abel as his successor in May, saying at the time that he planned to step down as CEO. The move surprised many investors, as it was widely assumed Abel would not take over until after Buffett's death. While Buffett will no longer run the company, he will remain chairman and continue coming into the office five days a week, giving Abel regular access to his longtime mentor.",
      "Here's what to know about Abel, the new leader of Berkshire Hathaway, and how his leadership approach could differ from Buffett's.",
      "Who is Greg Abel?",
      "Abel, a former amateur hockey player and avid golfer, joined Berkshire in 2000 after serving as CEO of MidAmerican, an Iowa-based utility company. Once at Berkshire, he helped transform the recently acquired MidAmerican into Berkshire Hathaway Energy, the largest producer of wind energy in the country.",
      "Before taking on his new role as CEO, the Canadian executive oversaw Berkshire's non-insurance companies and served as vice chairman of Berkshire's board of directors.",
      "What has Buffett said about Abel?",
      "Buffett has repeatedly expressed confidence in Abel's ability to lead Berkshire's operations, most recently during a CNBC interview, which partially aired on Friday.",
      "Buffet said Abel will be the \"decider,\" adding that he \"can't imagine how much more [Abel] can get accomplished in a week than I can in a month.\"",
      "\"I'd rather have Greg handling my money than any of the top investment advisors or any of the top CEOs in the United States,\" he told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"",
      "Buffett also reiterated his belief in Abel's leadership during the final letter he penned to shareholders in November 2025.",
      "\"Greg Abel has more than met the high expectations I had for him when I first thought he should be Berkshire's next CEO,\" he wrote. \"He understands many of our businesses and personnel far better than I now do, and he is a very fast learner about matters many CEOs don't even consider.\"",
      "What sort of changes might Abel make?",
      "CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert said it would be natural for Abel to make some changes in the way Berkshire is run. Taking a more traditional approach to leadership with nearly 400,000 employees spread across dozens of subsidiaries makes a lot of sense, she said.",
      "The new CEO has already announced some leadership changes, including the appointment of NetJets CEO Adam Johnson as manager of all of Berkshire's consumer, service and retail businesses.",
      "He will also eventually face more pressure to start paying a dividend. Historically, Berkshire has favored reinvesting profits over making quarterly or annual payouts to shareholders.",
      "While Abel is viewed as more hands-on than Buffett, experts say he's not expected to initiate any major shake-ups at the decades-old company.

    "summary": "Tesla's electric vehicle sales fell 9% in 2025 from a year ago amid the expiration of a $7,500 EV U.S. tax credit.",
    "story": [
      "Tesla on Friday reported a second straight annual drop in electric vehicle sales, as the phaseout of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit and mounting competition weighed on demand. With the decline, Tesla lost its title as the world's bestselling electric vehicle maker.",
      "The company said it delivered 1.64 million vehicles in 2025, down 9% from 1.79 million in 2024. Sales also declined in the fourth quarter, tumbling 15.6% to 418,227 vehicles, short of the 440,000 that analysts polled by FactSet expected.",
      "China's BYD, which sold 2.26 million vehicles last year, is now the world's biggest EV maker.",
      "Tesla has struggled amid heightened competition from rival automakers, as well as a backlash from some consumers over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration. Musk had headed up the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, where he oversaw cuts to the government workforce and some funding programs before stepping back in May\u00a0to refocus on Tesla.",
      "At the same time, the expiration last fall of the $7,500 EV tax credit likely hurt demand as it removed an incentive that had enticed some consumers to buy or lease electric vehicles, which tend to be pricier than gas-powered cars.",
      "Despite such challenges, Tesla's stock finished 2025 with a gain of roughly 11%, as investors hope Musk can deliver on his ambitions to make the company a leader in robotaxi service and get consumers to embrace humanoid robots that can perform basic tasks in homes and offices.",
      "Although Tesla's sales came in lower than analysts had forecast, the results were better than some had feared, noted Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives. Investors, meanwhile, are betting that Tesla's other businesses \u2014 its energy unit and its push into robotics, including a humanoid robot and a robotaxi service \u2014 can serve as growth engines.",
      "\"We estimate the AI and autonomous opportunity is worth at least $1 trillion alone for Tesla,\" Ives said in a report.",
      "He added that Tesla's core automotive division is facing \"a more difficult demand environment following the end of the EV tax credit while Europe remains a headwind to its deliveries.\"",
      "Shares of Tesla rose $4.16, or 0.9%, to $453.88 in early trading Friday.",
      "Cheaper Tesla models",
      "The latest quarter was the first reporting period that includes sales of stripped-down versions of the Model Y and Model 3, which Tesla unveiled in early October as part of an effort to revive sales. The new Model Y costs just under $40,000, while the cheaper Model 3 sells for under $37,000. Those versions are expected to help Tesla compete with Chinese models in Europe and Asia.",
      "Tesla faces fierce competition both abroad and in the U.S. from rival EV makers. BYD \u2014 known as \"Biyadi\" in Chinese or by the English slogan \"Build Your Dreams\" \u2014 now dominates China's highly competitive EV market, which is the world's largest.",
      "While BYD vehicles aren't sold in the U.S., its sales in Europe, Australia and other regions around the world are surging, thanks partly to pricing that is generally lower than Tesla's and other U.S. automakers, according to the BBC.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aca-health-subsidies-insurance-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 01 Jan 2026 21:14:20 -0500",
    "summary": "Enhanced tax credits that have helped Americans offset the cost of Affordable Care Act health insurance for the last four years expired overnight.",
    "story": [
      "Enhanced tax credits that have helped reduce the cost of health insurance for the vast majority of Affordable Care Act enrollees expired overnight as 2026 arrived, cementing higher health costs for millions of Americans at the start of the new year.",
      "Democrats forced a 43-day government shutdown over the issue. Moderate Republicans called for a solution to save their 2026 political aspirations. President Trump floated a way out, only to back off after conservative backlash.",
      "In the end, no one's efforts were enough to save the subsidies before their expiration date. A House vote expected in January could offer another chance, but success is far from guaranteed.",
      "The change affects a diverse cross-section of Americans who don't get their health insurance from an employer and don't qualify for Medicaid or Medicare \u2014 a group that includes many self-employed workers, small business owners, farmers and ranchers.",
      "It comes at the start of a high-stakes midterm election year, with affordability \u2014 including the cost of health care \u2014 topping the list of voters' concerns.",
      "\"It really bothers me that the middle class has moved from a squeeze to a full suffocation, and they continue to just pile on and leave it up to us,\" said 37-year-old single mom Katelin Provost, whose health care costs are set to jump. \"I'm incredibly disappointed that there hasn't been more action.\"",
      "Subsidies helped reduce costs since pandemic",
      "The expired subsidies were first given to Affordable Care Act enrollees in 2021 as a temporary measure to help Americans get through the COVID-19 pandemic. Democrats in power at the time extended them, moving the expiration date to the start of 2026.",
      "With the expanded subsidies, some lower-income enrollees received health care with no premiums, and high earners paid no more than 8.5% of their income. Eligibility for middle-class earners was also expanded.",
      "On average, the more than 20 million subsidized enrollees in the Affordable Care Act program are seeing their premium costs rise by 114% in 2026, according to an analysis by the health care research nonprofit KFF.",
      "Those surging prices come alongside an overall increase in health costs in the U.S., which are further driving up out-of-pocket costs in many plans.",
      "Some enrollees, like Salt Lake City freelance filmmaker and adjunct professor Stan Clawson, have absorbed the extra expense. Clawson said he was paying just under $350 a month for his premiums last year, a number that will jump to nearly $500 a month this year. It's a strain for the 49-year-old but one he's willing to take on because he needs health insurance as someone who lives with paralysis from a spinal cord injury.",
      "Others, like Provost, are dealing with steeper hikes. The social worker's monthly premium payment is increasing from $85 a month to nearly $750.",
      "Lori Hunt of Des Moines, Iowa, spoke with CBS News during the congressional stalemate in October and said she \"couldn't afford\" health insurance without the subsidies.",
      "\"I'd have to cancel my insurance,\" Hunt said, joking that her insurance would consist of \"thoughts and prayers.\"",
      "Hunt survived breast cancer three years ago and was laid off from her job in 2025. Without the subsidies, she expected her ACA premium would jump to about $700 per month. \"It would be more than my mortgage payment,\" Hunt said.",
      "Many expected to go without coverage",
      "Health analysts have predicted the expiration of the subsidies will drive many of the 24 million total Affordable Care Act enrollees \u2014 especially younger and healthier Americans \u2014 to forgo health insurance coverage altogether.",
      "Over time, that could make the program more expensive for the older, sicker population that remains.",
      "An analysis conducted last September by the Urban Institute and Commonwealth Fund projected the higher premiums from expiring subsidies would prompt some 4.8 million Americans to drop coverage in 2026.",
      "The impact could be greatest in Florida, which has the largest number of ACA enrollees of any state \u2014 more than 4.7 million, according to KFF data. Texas is next, with more than 3.9 million, followed by California, Georgia and North Carolina.",
      "Kylie Barrios, a 30-year-old Florida resident, said she expected to be among those losing coverage.",
      "\"Our health insurance premium is effectively tripling from 2025 to 2026,\" she told CBS News in December, saying it would rise from about $900 to $2,500.",
      "Provost, the single mother, said she is holding out hope that Congress finds a way to revive the subsidies early in the year \u2014 but if not, she'll drop herself off the insurance and keep it only for her 4-year-old daughter. She can't afford to pay for both of their coverage at the current price.",
      "But with the window to select and change plans still ongoing until Jan. 15 in most states, the final effect on enrollment is yet to be determined.",
      "Last year, after Republicans cut more than $1 trillion in federal health care and food assistance with Mr. Trump's big tax and spending cuts bill, Democrats repeatedly called for the subsidies to be extended. But while some Republicans in power acknowledged the issue needed to be addressed, they refused to put it to a vote until late in the year.",
      "In December, the Senate rejected two partisan health care bills \u2014 a Democratic pitch to extend the subsidies for three more years and a Republican alternative that would instead provide Americans with health savings accounts.",
      "In the House, four centrist Republicans broke with GOP leadership and joined forces with Democrats to force a vote that could come as soon as January on a three-year extension of the tax credits. But with the Senate already having rejected such a plan, it's unclear whether it could get enough momentum to pass.",
      "Meanwhile, Americans whose premiums are skyrocketing say lawmakers don't understand what it's really like to struggle to get by as health costs ratchet up with no relief.",
      "Many say they want the subsidies restored alongside broader reforms to make health care more affordable for all Americans.",
      "\"Both Republicans and Democrats have been saying for years, oh, we need to fix it. Then do it,\" said Chad Bruns, a 58-year-old Affordable Care Act enrollee in Wisconsin. \"They need to get to the root cause, and no political party ever does that.\"",
      "Barrios, who said she has generally voted Republican, said she would like politicians to \"act on those values that they ... claim to protect.\"",
      "\"The whole system feels as though it's failed and isn't advocating for me as a small business owner, as somebody who wants to become a mom and have a family,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. has rolled back proposed steep tariffs on Italian-made pasta, the U.S. Department of Commerce and Italy's foreign ministry both said Thursday.",
      "The Commerce Department has sharply reduced a proposed duty on 13 Italian pasta makers, cutting the rate from as high as 92% to as little as 2.26%, Italy's foreign ministry said Jan. 1. The duties would have been imposed on top of existing 15% tariffs on most imports from the European Union.",
      "The Trump administration had proposed the antidumping levies after a review found that Italian pasta producers, including Barilla, La Molisana and Pastificio Lucio Garofalo, sold products at artificially low prices that undercut U.S. manufacturers. Together, the 13 pasta producers account for 16% of imported pasta from Italy to the United States, according to the Commerce Department.",
      "Had the higher duties taken effect, U.S. shoppers could have faced steeply higher prices for Italian-made pasta, and some Italian producers might have stopped shipping to U.S. retailers, experts told CBS News.",
      "\"The recalculation of the duties is a sign that U.S. authorities recognize our companies' genuine willingness to cooperate,\" the foreign ministry said.",
      "La Molisana pasta imports will be tariffed at a rate of 2.26%, the foreign ministry said, while Garofalo will face nearly 14% tariffs, and 11 additional pasta brands will be subject to a 9% import duty.",
      "A spokesperson for the Commerce Department told CBS News that the new antidumping rates were based on an \"evaluation of additional comments received\" after the proposed duty rates were determined.",
      "\"This post-preliminary analysis indicates that Italian pasta makers have addressed many of Commerce's concerns raised in the preliminary determination, and reflects Commerce's commitment to a fair, transparent process. Commerce will continue to engage with interested parties to take into account all information before issuing the final determination,\" the spokesperson said.",

      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",

      "A federal appeals court ruling on New Year's Eve blocked Hawaii from enforcing a\u00a0climate change tourist tax\u00a0on cruise ship passengers, a levy that was set to go into effect at the start of 2026.",
      "Cruise Lines International Association challenged the tax in a lawsuit, arguing that the new law violates the U.S. Constitution by taxing cruise ships for entering Hawaii ports. They also argued it would make cruises more expensive.",
      "The levy increases rates on hotel room and vacation rental stays but also imposes a new 11% tax on the gross fares paid by a cruise ship's passenger, prorated for the number of days the vessels are in Hawaii ports. The lawsuit notes the law authorizes counties to collect an additional 3% surcharge, bringing the total to 14% of prorated fares.",
      "In the nation's first such levy to help cope with a warming planet, Hawaii Gov. Josh Green signed legislation in May that raises tax revenue to deal with eroding shorelines, wildfires and other climate problems. Officials estimate the tax would generate nearly $100 million annually.",

      "\"We remain confident that Act 96 is lawful and will be vindicated when the appeal is heard on the merits,\" Toni Schwartz, spokesperson for the Hawaii attorney general's office, said in an email.",

    "summary": "Starting January 1, food-stamp recipients in five U.S. states will face restrictions on using the benefits to buy some sugary foods.",
    "story": [
      "Starting New Year's Day, some food-stamp recipients around the U.S. will be banned from using the government nutrition assistance to buy candy, soda and other foods.",
      "Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Utah and West Virginia are the first of at least 18 states to enact waivers prohibiting people enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, from purchasing certain foods. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins have urged states to strip foods regarded as unhealthy from the $100 billion federal program.",
      "\"We cannot continue a system that forces taxpayers to fund programs that make people sick and then pay a second time to treat the illnesses those very programs help create,\" Kennedy said in a statement in December.",
      "The efforts are aimed at reducing chronic diseases such as obesity and diabetes associated with sweetened drinks and other treats, a key goal of Kennedy's Make America Healthy Again effort.",
      "Confusion for SNAP recipients?",
      "But retail industry and health policy experts said state SNAP programs, already under pressure from steep budget cuts, are unprepared for the complex changes, with no complete lists of the foods affected and technical point-of-sale challenges that vary by state and store. And research remains mixed about whether restricting SNAP purchases improves diet quality and health.",
      "The National Retail Federation, a trade association, predicted longer checkout lines and more customer complaints as SNAP recipients learn which foods are affected by the new waivers.",
      "\"It's a disaster waiting to happen of people trying to buy food and being rejected,\" said Kate Bauer, a nutrition science expert at the University of Michigan.",
      "The new restrictions are the latest source of concern for SNAP recipients. Food aid distributed under the program, which is used by 42 million Americans, was interrupted during the 43-day U.S. government shutdown. Reliance on food stamps typically surges during economic downturns, such as the sharp slump that followed the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.",
      "Nearly 62% of SNAP participants are in families with children, while roughly 37% are in households with older adults or people with disabilities,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to Purdue's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "While the prevalence of food insecurity around the U.S. fluctuates month to month, the overall rate had been declining since 2022, when an average of 15.4% of households were food insecure as inflation hit\u00a040-year highs\u00a0following the pandemic.",
      "Retailers fear impact",
      "A report by the National Grocers Association and other industry trade groups estimated that implementing SNAP restrictions would cost U.S. retailers $1.6 billion initially and $759 million each year going forward.",
      "\"Punishing SNAP recipients means we all get to pay more at the grocery store,\" said Gina Plata-Nino, SNAP director for the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center.",
      "The waivers are a departure from decades of federal policy first enacted in 1964 and later authorized by the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, which said SNAP benefits can be used for \"any food or food product intended for human consumption,\" except alcohol and ready-to-eat hot foods. The law also says SNAP can't pay for tobacco.",
      "In the past, lawmakers have proposed stopping SNAP from paying for expensive meats like steak or so-called junk foods, such as chips and ice cream.",
      "But previous waiver requests were denied based on USDA research concluding that restrictions would be costly and complicated to implement, and that they might not change recipients' buying habits or reduce health problems such as obesity.",
      "Under the second Trump administration, however, states have been encouraged and even incentivized to seek waivers \u2013 and they responded.",
      "\"This isn't the usual top-down, one-size-fits-all public health agenda,\" Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said when he announced his state's request last spring. \"We're focused on root causes, transparent information and real results.\"",
      "How many people are affected",
      "The five state waivers that take effect Jan. 1 affect about 1.4 million people. Utah and West Virginia will ban the use of SNAP to buy soda and soft drinks, while Nebraska will prohibit soda and energy drinks. Indiana will target soft drinks and candy. In Iowa, which has the most restrictive rules to date, the SNAP limits affect taxable foods, including soda and candy, but also certain prepared foods.",
      "\"The items list does not provide enough specific information to prepare a SNAP participant to go to the grocery store,\" Plata-Nino wrote in a blog post. \"Many additional items \u2014 including certain prepared foods \u2014 will also be disallowed, even though they are not clearly identified in the notice to households.\"",
      "Marc Craig, 47, of Des Moines, said he has been living in his car since October. He said the new waivers will make it more difficult to determine how to use the $298 in SNAP benefits he receives each month, while also increasing the stigma he feels at the cash register.",
      "\"They treat people that get food stamps like we're not people,\" Craig said.",
      "SNAP waivers enacted now and in the coming months will run for two years, with the option to extend them for an additional three, according to the Agriculture Department. Each state is required to assess the impact of the changes.",
      "Health experts worry that the waivers ignore larger factors affecting the health of SNAP recipients, said Anand Parekh, a medical doctor who is the chief health policy officer at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.",
      "\"This doesn't solve the two fundamental problems, which is healthy food in this country is not affordable and unhealthy food is cheap and ubiquitous,\" he said.",

      "The average long-term mortgage rate dipped to 6.15% from 6.18% last week, mortgage buyer Freddie Mac said Wednesday. That's the lowest average long-term rate since October 3, 2024, when it dipped to 6.12% before shooting back up. One year ago, the rate averaged 6.91%.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners refinancing their home loans, fell this week to 5.44% from 5.5% the previous week. A year ago it averaged 6.13%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, from the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy decisions to bond market investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. They generally follow the trajectory of the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a guide to pricing home loans.",
      "The 10-year yield was at 4.14% at midday Wednesday, down a touch from last week's 4.15%.",
      "Mortgage rates began easing in July in anticipation of a series of Fed rate cuts, which began in September and continued this month.",
      "The Fed doesn't set mortgage rates, but when it cuts its short-term rate that can signal lower inflation or slower economic growth ahead, which can drive investors to buy U.S. government bonds. That can help lower yields on long-term U.S. Treasurys, which can result in lower mortgage rates.",
      "Even so, Fed rate cuts don't always translate into lower mortgage rates.",
      "Home shoppers who can afford to pay cash or finance at current mortgage rates are in a more favorable position than they were a year ago. Home listings are up sharply from 2024, and many sellers have resorted to lowering their initial asking price as homes take longer to sell, according to data from Realtor.com.",
      "Most homes across U.S. are unaffordable",
      "Still, affordability remains a challenge for aspiring homeowners, especially first-time buyers who don't have equity from an existing home to put toward a new home purchase. Uncertainty over the economy and job market\u00a0is also keeping many would-be buyers on the sidelines.",
      "Sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November from the previous month, but slowed compared to a year earlier for the first time since May, despite average long-term mortgage rates holding near their low point for the year. Through the first 11 months of this year, home sales are down 0.5% compared to the same period last year.",

    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 10:32:26 -0500",
    "summary": "From stubbornly high living costs to a softer labor market, economists say these are the forces that will shape the year ahead.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy navigated 2025 with a resilience that surprised many experts, as growth accelerated and inflation remained relatively muted despite the Trump administration's steep tariffs on imports.",
      "Although Americans say they aren't yet feeling the benefits of an expanding economy amid ongoing concerns about the cost of living, many economists expect the U.S. to be on firmer footing next year.",
      "\"I think it'll be a better year,\" Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Michael Pearce told CBS News. \"Tax cuts will be center stage, and we'll see a broadening out of economic strength.\"",
      "Here are what experts see as the key economic questions facing the U.S. in 2026.",
      "Will affordability improve?",
      "Probably not \u2014 at least not in a way most Americans will feel right away. Inflation has cooled since peaking at a 40-year high in 2022, but prices remain elevated, squeezing many households and making it harder to cover basic expenses. About 7 in 10 Americans polled by CBS News in December said they were struggling to pay for food, housing and health care, underscoring the affordability issues affecting millions of households.",
      "Rising utility costs are another challenge. Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utilities, up 12% since last year, according to a recent\u00a0report\u00a0from The Century Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.\u00a0 Meanwhile, the average household is expected to pay an average of $995 on home heating this winter, a 9.2% increase from last year, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association.",
      "More broadly, inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target, with the Consumer Price Index in November at 2.7%. For consumers, that means prices for everyday goods and services are still climbing, continuing to strain household budgets.",
      "Inflation should cool to about 2.4% in 2026, according to a December forecast from the Federal Reserve. But that would still leave inflation above the central bank's goal, signaling that \"higher inflation will continue to weigh on family finances\" next year, William Blair economist Richard de Chazal said in a report.",
      "About one-third of Americans think their finances are likely to worsen in the year ahead, primarily driven by inflation concerns, a recent Bankrate\u00a0survey\u00a0found.",
      "Wages will need to outpace inflation for a sustained period before households feel they are getting ahead, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said at a Dec. 10 press conference.",
      "\"We're going to need to have some years where \u2026 nominal wages are higher than inflation for people to start feeling good about affordability,\" he noted.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve continue to cut interest rates?",
      "Another big question is whether the Federal Reserve will continue cutting its benchmark interest rate after three consecutive reductions that began in September.",
      "Although the Fed has a so-called dual mandate to keep both inflation and unemployment low, the central bank is currently being pulled in two directions. Prices are rising faster than the Fed would like, which could call for higher interest rates if the trend persists or inflation re-ignites in 2026. At the same time, rising unemployment and cooler hiring might require policymakers to further lower rates in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed panel that sets monetary policy, in December penciled in only\u00a0one additional rate cut for 2026. Yet some economists believe the Fed could make additional cuts, especially if the labor market continues to slow.",
      "President Trump has argued that the Fed should drastically cut its benchmark rate, pressing Fed Chair Jerome Powell to reduce borrowing costs. With Powell's term set to expire in May, Mr. Trump is expected to nominate a new chair who is more open to cutting rates.",
      "Will housing become more affordable in 2026?",
      "Homes across the U.S. could be modestly more affordable in 2026, Chen Zhao, head of economics research at real estate company Redfin, told CBS News.",
      "Mortgage rates are likely to remain in the low 6% range, not far off from today's 30-year mortgage rate of about 6.18%, while home\u00a0prices are likely to grow at a slower pace than incomes next year.",
      "\"We're starting to head on a road that leads to better affordability metrics, but it's not going to be an overnight shift,\" she said. \"2026 might not feel all that different than the end of 2025 \u2014 it's a slow process that might take five or six years, but at least we're heading in the right direction.\"",
      "Home prices are projected to dip in about two dozen major U.S. cities in 2026, mostly located in the Southeast and the West, according to a Realtor.com analysis.",
      "Will the job market pick up steam?",
      "Hiring could improve in 2026 as economic growth accelerates and the effects of tariffs fade, according to Goldman Sachs.",
      "Average payroll gains could rise to an average of 70,000 per month next year, more than double the 32,000 per month average in 2025, economists with the investment bank forecast in a report. They expect wages to climb 2.3% in 2026, accelerating from 1.9% this year.",
      "However, some economists warn that the job market could remain relatively muted as companies turn to artificial intelligence to improve productivity.",
      "Are stocks in a bubble?",
      "A critical question for financial markets this year \u2014 are companies involved in AI overvalued \u2014 is likely to again take center stage in 2026.",
      "The S&P 500 is on track to end the year with a gain of more than 17%, with the index buoyed by artificial intelligence companies and big tech companies. However, some investors are growing cautious about the meteoric rise of AI-related stocks, questioning whether a bubble is forming.",
      "Such bubbles \u2014 when stock valuations run far ahead of underlying fundamentals \u2014 can set the stage for sharp market corrections if investor sentiment sours. Yet stock valuations remain below the levels seen during the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, according to Jonas Goltermann, deputy chief markets economist at Capital Economics. He expects investment in AI to continue next year as more companies adopt the technology.",
      "Still, although AI stocks are unlikely to crash next year, investors' lofty expectations may be in for a reality check",
      "\"At some point, investors are likely to be disappointed, and the cycle of ever rising investment, expectations and valuations will end, as proved the case with previous equity bubbles,\" Goltermann said in a report.",
      "Overall, forecasters expect a strong stock market performance in 2026. J.P. Morgan in November forecast the S&P 500 will rise 13% to 15% next year, roughly in line with the index's average gain over the last decade.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-17000-commercial-drivers-licenses-delay-revoking-feds-threat-immigrants/",
    "published": "Wed, 31 Dec 2025 06:15:15 -0500",
    "summary": "In light of a suit by immigrants groups, California says it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses despite a federal threat to withhold $160 million in funding.",
    "story": [
      "A week after immigrant groups filed a lawsuit, California said Tuesday it will delay the revocations of 17,000 commercial driver's licenses until March to allow more time to ensure that truckers and bus drivers who legally qualify for the licenses can keep them.",
      "But U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the state may lose $160 million if it doesn't meet a Jan. 5 deadline to revoke the licenses. He already withheld $40 million in federal funding because, he said, California isn't enforcing English proficiency requirements for truckers.",
      "California only sent out notices to invalidate the licenses after Duffy pressured the state to make sure immigrants who are in the country illegally aren't granted the licenses. An audit found problems like licenses that remained valid long after an immigrant's authorization to be in the country expired or licenses where the state couldn't prove it checked a driver's immigration status.",
      "\"California does NOT have an 'extension' to keep breaking the law and putting Americans at risk on the roads,\" Duffy posted on the social platform X.",
      "The Transportation Department has been prioritizing the issue ever since a truck driver who was not authorized to be in the U.S. made an illegal U-turn and caused a crash in Florida that killed three people in August.",
      "California officials said they're working to make sure the federal Transportation Department is satisfied with the reforms they've put in place. The state had planned to resume issuing commercial driver's licenses in mid-December, but the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration blocked that.",
      "\"Commercial drivers are an important part of our economy - our supply chains don't move, and our communities don't stay connected without them,\" said DMV Director Steve Gordon.",
      "The Sikh Coalition, a national group defending the civil rights of Sikhs, and the San Francisco-based Asian Law Caucus filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of the California drivers. They said immigrant truck drivers were being unfairly targeted. The driver in the Florida crash and the driver in another fatal crash in California in October are both Sikhs.",
      "Immigrants account for about 20% of all truck drivers, but the non-domiciled licenses immigrants can receive only represent about 5% of all commercial driver's licenses, or about 200,000 drivers. The Transportation Department also proposed new restrictions that would severely limit which noncitizens could get a license, but a court put the new rules on hold.",
      "Mumeeth Kaur, the legal director of the Sikh Coalition, said this delay \"is an important step towards alleviating the immediate threat that these drivers are facing to their lives and livelihoods.\"",
      "Duffy previously threatened to withhold millions of dollars in federal funding from California, Pennsylvania and Minnesota after audits found significant problems under the existing rules like commercial licenses being valid long after an immigrant truck driver's work permit expired. He dropped the threat to withhold $160 million from California after the state said it would revoke the licenses because the state was complying.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/december-interest-rate-cut-fed-minutes/",
    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 16:37:24 -0500",
    "summary": "The minutes released Tuesday indicate that some Fed officials who supported the rate cut had reservations.",
    "story": [
      "Some Federal Reserve officials who supported cutting a key interest rate earlier this month could have instead backed keeping the rate unchanged, minutes released Tuesday show, underscoring the divisions and uncertainty permeating the central bank.",
      "At their December 9-10 meeting, Fed officials agreed to cut their key interest rate by a quarter point for the third time this year, to about 3.6%, the lowest in nearly three years.",
      "Yet the move was approved by a 9-3 vote, an unusual level of dissent for a committee that typically works by consensus. Two Fed officials supported keeping the rate unchanged, while one wanted a larger, half-point reduction.",
      "The minutes underscored the deep split on the 19-member policymaking committee over what constitutes the biggest threat to the economy: weak hiring or stubbornly elevated inflation. If a sluggish job market is the biggest threat, then the Fed would typically cut rates more. But if still-high inflation is the bigger problem, then the Fed would keep rates elevated, or even raise them.",
      "Just 12 of the 19 members vote on rate decisions, though all participate in discussions.",
      "The minutes showed that even some Fed officials who supported the rate cut did so with reservations. Some Fed officials wanted to wait for more economic data before making any further moves, the minutes said. Key economic data on jobs, inflation, and growth were delayed by the six-week government shutdown, leaving Fed officials with only outdated information at their meeting earlier this month.",
      "The minutes don't identify specific officials. But how they vote is public, and two policymakers dissented in favor of keeping rates unchanged: Jeffrey Schmid, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and Austan Goolsbee, president of the Chicago Fed.",
      "The third dissent was from Fed governor Stephen Miran, who was appointed by President Donald Trump in September and favored a half-point cut.",
      "When the Fed reduces its key rate, over time it can lower borrowing costs for homes, cars, and credit cards, though market forces also affect those rates.",
      "At its December meeting, the Fed also released quarterly economic projections, which also showed the extent of the divisions on the Fed committee. Seven officials projected no cuts in 2026, while eight forecast two or more reductions. Four supported just one cut.",
      "Weaker job market",
      "A weaker job market would likely spur the Fed to reduce borrowing costs more quickly. Two weeks ago, the government reported that employers had cut about 40,000 jobs in October and November, while the unemployment rate rose to 4.6%, a four-year high.",
      "Inflation, meanwhile, remains above the Fed's 2% target, complicating the central bank's next moves. In November, annual inflation cooled to 2.7%, down from 3% in September, but last month's data were likely distorted by the shutdown, economists said, which forced the government to estimate many price changes rather than measuring them directly.",
      "Powell said after the Dec. 10 meeting that the central bank cut rates out of concern that the job market is even weaker than it appears.",
      "While government data shows that the economy added just 40,000 jobs a month from April through September, Powell said that figure could be revised lower by as much as 60,000, which would mean employers actually shed an average of 20,000 jobs a month during that period.",
      "\"It's a labor market that seems to have significant downside risks,\" Powell told reporters. \"People care about that. That's their jobs.\"",

      "Gold futures have also soared this year, with the precious metal hitting record highs earlier in December.",
      "Investors have been piling into precious metals this year as a safe haven amid rising geopolitical tensions, as well as a hedge against inflation. That's helped drive sharp gains in both silver and gold.",

      "Despite silver's price gains this year, the metal is still far from its inflation-adjusted price record, which was set in 1980, he noted. \u00a0\"To return to that level, silver would have to cost $200 per ounce today,\" he noted.",
      "Monday's selloff in silver was sparked by a technical change at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, one of the world's largest commodities trading venues. The exchange said it would require traders to put up more cash to hold positions in silver, gold and other metals after prices surged this year.",
      "The CME raised margin requirements for the contracts in a notice posted Friday. Such moves are designed to protect the exchange by reducing the risk that traders cannot cover their bets if prices swing sharply.",

      "Even with a 4.7% decline to start the week, copper futures have soared more than 42% this year, on pace for the largest gain in 16 years. Copper is critical to global energy infrastructure, and demand is expected to keep growing as the development of artificial intelligence technology puts more of a strain on data centers and the energy grid.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 12:19:05 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge has ruled that the White House cannot stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
    "story": [
      "The White House may not stop funding the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a federal judge ruled Tuesday, days before funds at the bureau were likely to run out and the consumer finance agency would lack the funds to pay its employees.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman ruled the CFPB can continue to get its funds from the Federal Reserve, though the Fed is operating at a loss, and the White House has made a new legal argument that way the CFPB gets its funds is not valid.",
      "At the heart of this case is whether White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who is also the acting director of the CFPB, can effectively shut down the agency and lay off all of the bureau's employees. The CFPB has largely been inoperable since President Trump was sworn into office nearly a year ago. Its employees are mostly forbidden from doing any work, and most of the bureau's operations this year has been to unwind the work it did under President Biden and even under Mr. Trump's first term.",
      "Vought himself has made comments indicating he intends to effectively shut down the CFPB.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents the workers at the CFPB, has been mostly successful in its legal efforts to stop the mass layoffs. The union sued Vought earlier this year and won a preliminary injunction stopping the layoffs.",
      "In recent weeks, the White House has used a new line of argument to potentially get around the court's restraining order. The argument is that the Federal Reserve has no \"combined earnings\" at the moment to fund the CFPB's operations. The CFPB obtains its funding from the Fed through expected quarterly payments.",
      "The Federal Reserve has been operating at a paper loss since 2022 as a result of the central bank's efforts to combat inflation. The Fed holds bonds on its balance sheet from a period of low interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, but currently has to pay out higher interest rates to banks that hold their deposits at the central bank. The Fed has been recording a \"deferred asset\" on its balance sheet which it expects will be paid down in the next few years as the low interest bonds mature off the Fed's balance sheet.",
      "Because of this loss on paper, the White House has argued there are no \"combined earnings\" for the CFPB to draw on. The CFPB has operated since 2011, including under Mr. Trump's first term, drawing on the Fed's operating budget.",
      "White House lawyers sent a notice to the court in early November, where they argued that the CFPB would run out of appropriations in early 2026, under the \"combined earnings\" argument, and does not expect to receive any additional appropriations from Congress.",
      "This combined earnings legal argument is not entirely new. It has floated in conservative legal circles going back to the moment the Federal Reserve started operating at a loss. However, it has never been tested in court.",
      "\"It appears that defendants' new understanding of \"combined earnings\" is an unsupported and transparent attempt to starve the CPFB of funding and yet another attempt to achieve the very end the Court's injunction was put in place to prevent,\" Berman wrote in an opinion.",
      "A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Berman's opinion.",

    "summary": "Several lawmakers are condemning President Trump after he shared a video on social media Saturday alleging Gov. Tim Walz is behind the assassination of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman.",
    "story": [
      "The children of former Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman are asking President Trump to remove a video he reposted on social media Saturday alleging Gov. Tim Walz is behind their mother's\u00a0assassination.",
      "Walz responded to the president's Truth Social post, saying it is \"dangerous, depraved behavior from the sitting president of the United States.\"",
      "\"In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed. America is better than this,\" Walz said.",
      "Hortman was shot and killed alongside her husband, Mark, and their dog, Gilbert, on June 14, 2025, inside the family's Brooklyn Park home. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, were shot and wounded in their Champlin home 90 minutes earlier.",
      "Vance Boelter, 58, faces\u00a0federal charges\u00a0for the shootings, including two counts of murder. He allegedly dressed as a police officer and managed to evade arrest for 40 hours.\u00a0 According to prosecutors, Boelter had a hit list of lawmakers and other public officials, including staffers at Planned Parenthood. He pleaded\u00a0not guilty\u00a0in August.",
      "Mr. Trump first reshared the video that states Boelter made the claim Walz ordered him to kill Hortman in a letter authorities say they found in his vehicle. Then-acting U.S. attorney Joe Thompson called the letter a \"delusion\" that seemed \"designed to conceal his crimes.\"",
      "The Hortmans' children, Sophie and Colin, on Sunday afternoon asked Mr. Trump to remove the post, saying it promotes a \"false narrative.\"",
      "\"The video being shared by the president is another hurdle our family must overcome in grieving the loss of my parents, Mark and Melissa, and their beloved Gilbert,\" Sophie Hortman said. \"I ask President Trump to please consider the pain and sadness we have faced, and to honor the spirit of the holidays we have just spent without our parents by taking down the post on Truth Social.\"",
      "Colin Hortman also debunked one of the claims made in the video shared by Mr. Trump regarding a vote his mother made shortly before her death to remove undocumented immigrant adults from the state's health care coverage program. Hortman was the sole Democrat to vote for it in the tied House chamber, clearing the way for its passage.",
      "\"When I called her after the legislative session ended, I asked why she voted for the bill mentioned in the video shared by President Trump, and she wept. That bill and her vote had nothing to do with fraud. She voted for that bill because it was the only way to avoid a government shutdown,\" Colin Hortman said. \"She had never really voted against her conscience like that. It was emotional and extremely difficult.\"",
      "The White House had not responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "In a statement, House DFL Leader\u00a0Zack Stephenson\u00a0called out Mr. Trump, saying the claims about Hortman's death are \"untruthful\" and \"outrageous.\"",
      "\"Tonight, Donald Trump, who couldn't be bothered to lower the flags to half staff or even say Melissa Hortman's name until now, is spreading outrageous lies about her death,\" Stephenson said. \"Here is the truth: Melissa was murdered by a right-wing, anti-abortion extremist who believed conspiracy theories about COVID. Melissa Hortman and Tim Walz were friends and allies. Anyone who claims otherwise is lying.\"",
      "Stephenson went on to say that any political leader in the state who does not condemn the president's post \"isn't fit to hold office.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Julia Coleman also encouraged lawmakers to \"call for an end to baseless conspiracy theories\" above a post mentioning Mr. Trump's online endorsement of the accusation.",
      "\"We must all reject this behavior outright and refuse to tolerate it. The American people, grieving families, and the legacies of those lost deserve far better,\" Coleman said. \"Debate policies fiercely. Fight for what you believe in. But do not speculate, guess, or spread stories that are plainly false and deeply harmful. It's time to restore dignity to our political discourse.\"",
      "Several Democratic lawmakers, including Reps. Angie Craig and Betty McCollum, called for Republican legislators to specifically condemn Mr. Trump's post.",
      "However, Republican state Rep. Walter Hudson disagreed.",
      "\"I'm not condemning anything, even if I disagree with it, after watching the abhorrent reaction to the death of Charlie Kirk from Democrats of every strata, and the indifference toward and election of Jay Jones.  I'm not playing this stupid game,\" Hudson said on X about Mr. Trump's Truth Social post.",
      "McCollum also demanded that the president apologize to the Hortman family, Walz and Minnesotans.",

The president had announced on social media hours earlier that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country.\" Officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special operations unit.",
      "Maduro and his wife were brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from what prosecutors have alleged is their participation in a conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine to the U.S. Maduro and his wife arrived at Stewart Airport just north of New York City on Saturday afternoon, hours after their capture.",
      "With Maduro's ouster, it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela or could lead the nation in the future. Mr. Trump said it would be \"very tough\" for Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado to take over because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"",
      "The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also had a conversation with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Mr. Trump said has been \"sworn in\" and is \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in remarks on state television, Rodriguez said Maduro is the \"only president of Venezuela\" and demanded his release. She was later granted full presidential power by the Venezuelan supreme court on Saturday and recognized by the military as the country's acting leader on Sunday.",
      "Venezuela held its last presidential election in July 2024, but election authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, and the U.S. and many European countries rejected Maduro's claim of victory. The U.S., under the Biden administration,\u00a0recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain in September 2024 after a warrant was issued for his arrest.",
      "Trump says U.S. will \"run it properly,\" but provides few details",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" in power in Venezuela.",
      "\"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. We've had decades of that. We're not going to let that happen,\" the president said. \"We're there now. And what people don't understand, but they understand as I say this, we're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\"",
      "He did not provide any additional details about how the U.S. would oversee Venezuela, under what authority, or whether the U.S. would play a role in picking a new leader.",
      "Mr. Trump did indicate that top administration officials \u2014 including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who appeared alongside Mr. Trump on Saturday \u2014 would work with a \"team\" working with the Venezuelan people. He did not, however, say who would be included in that group.",
      "In an interview Saturday evening, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth what that may look like.",
      "\"It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And ultimately, he'll decide what the iterations are of that,\" Hegseth said. \"But, it means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"",
      "Role of the oil industry",
      "When asked about a timeframe for U.S. involvement, Mr. Trump said Venezuela's \"whole infrastructure\" has to be rebuilt. He focused in particular on the prospect of rebuilding the oil industry in a nation with one of the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "\"If we just left, it [Venezuela] has zero chance of ever coming back,\" he said. \"We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "When asked about the\u00a0blockade of sanctioned oil\u00a0from Venezuela imposed by Mr. Trump last month, Hegseth said no oil is going in or out of the country, and the U.S. military is still poised in the Caribbean.",
      "\"[Mr. Trump] said it clearly at the podium today. We are going to get American companies in there. We are going to get investment in there. These oil depots have been operating at 20% capacity. That's going to change,\" Hegseth told CBS News.",
      "Maduro regime figures remain in place",
      "While the Trump administration has removed Maduro, top members of his government remain in place. Among them are Rodr\u00edguez, who Maduro selected as his vice president, as well as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Cabello is named as a defendant alongside Maduro and his wife in the superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York as allegedly part of the narco-terrorism conspiracy.",
      "Seemingly in a warning to Venezuelan officials who remain in place, Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack\" in Venezuela if needed, and that his administration is \"not afraid of boots on the ground.\"",
      "Rubio expanded on the comment on Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "When asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said, while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/january-6-attack-5-years-later-trump-pardons/",
    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 15:00:28 -0500",
    "summary": "The physical damage from the Capitol riot has been repaired \u2014 and President Trump has pardoned almost every defendant. What remains is a battle over the basic facts.",
    "story": [
      "Five years after the historic and damaging attack on the U.S. Capitol, millions of dollars in damages have been repaired and clean-up has long been completed. Many of the physical injuries have healed. And President Trump's pardons ended the largest criminal prosecution in American history, while freeing more than 1,500 defendants from criminal liability.",
      "What remains is a poisonous and lingering resentment over the riot and an ongoing battle to preserve the basic facts of what transpired on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "The president and some of his supporters have accused the Biden administration of weaponizing the Department of Justice against Jan. 6 defendants. In the process, Mr. Trump and surrogates have espoused arguments that are inconsistent with the facts of the cases, the timeline of events and public statistics from the Capitol siege prosecutions.",
      "In a letter to colleagues last week, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries announced a public meeting, with witness testimony, will be held on Tuesday to rebut claims about Jan. 6. Jeffries's letter said the meeting would \"expose the election deniers who hold high-level positions of significance in the executive branch and detail the threats to public safety posed by the hundreds of violent felons who were pardoned on the President's first day in office.\"",
      "Dan Hodges, a local Washington, D.C., police officer who was injured by the attack of the mob, said he is frustrated by an ongoing \"rewriting\" of the history of Jan. 6.",
      "\"Five years ago I thought: This has to be the most videotaped crime in American history. It's just so much evidence. There's no way anyone can possibly deny what occurred here,\" Hodges said in an interview. \"But that's exactly what's happening.\"",
      "Hodges, who spoke with CBS News as a citizen, separate from his ongoing role as a police officer, also said, \"The attack was everything it appeared to be on television.\"",
      "Mr. Trump himself \u2014 who has referred to Jan. 6 defendants as \"hostages\" for years \u2014 attempted to reframe or rewrite some of the key issues of the Jan. 6 prosecutions in the hours and days after issuing the pardons. He has claimed many defendants were actually innocent, were only responsible for \"minor\" infractions or were held in unfairly harsh conditions.",
      "At a January 2025 news conference, Mr. Trump said: \"These people have already served years in prison, and they've served them viciously.\" He also claimed Jan 6 rioters had \"served years in jail,\" then added that \"murderers don't even go to jail in this country.\"",
      "His statements excluded the more than 1,000 Jan 6 riot defendants who did not serve years in custody, and the hundreds of pardoned Capitol riot defendants who had not yet gone on trial or who served prison terms for cases in which they pleaded guilty.",
      "Mr. Trump also defended his acts of clemency during the same press conference by saying: \"It's a disgusting prison. It's been horrible. It's inhumane. It's been a terrible, terrible thing.\"",
      "The president did not specify which prison to which he was referring. The imprisoned Jan. 6 riot defendants served time in a wide range of federal prison facilities nationwide, all of which are operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Those include prisons in Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, West Virginia, California, Arizona, Ohio, Michigan and Florida, none of which has been singled out as \"inhumane\" by the prison bureau, which Trump now oversees.",
      "Although the local Washington, D.C., jail received criticism for its conditions in 2021 and 2022, when some Jan. 6 defendants were temporarily held there, the jail is not a prison. Nor was the jail used for those who were sentenced to federal prison terms.",
      "In a Fox News interview just days after returning to office, Mr. Trump justified his pardons by arguing, \"most of the people were absolutely innocent,\" which runs counter to many defendants' decision to plead guilty and admit to crimes. His statement is also belied by the perfect trial record secured by prosecutors, who obtained convictions in 100% of the jury trials held for Jan. 6 defendants who pleaded not guilty.",
      "During that interview, Mr. Trump also defended his pardoning of violent rioters who assaulted police, saying: \"They were very minor incidents.\"",
      "According to court records reviewed by CBS News, the injuries to police included violent assaults with a series of makeshift weapons, including bats, poles, bear spray, sticks, chemicals and fists. Around 140 police officers were injured, with some facing cracked ribs, smashed spinal disks and brain injuries, according to the union representing Capitol Police officers. Multiple police officers also died by suicide in the weeks after the siege.",
      "In an October 2025 social media post, Mr. Trump claimed the Biden administration had placed 274 FBI agents among the crowd at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, even though Biden had not yet been sworn in as president. Baseless claims that the riot was orchestrated by the FBI have circulated for years, though Trump-nominated FBI Director Kash Patel has said the 274 agents were deployed to the Capitol for \"crowd control.\"",
      "Some riot defendants have characterized the prosecutions as \"weaponization\" of the federal government by the Justice Department. Others have used the term \"staged,\" \"fake\" or \"fed-surrection\" to allege that the violent riot did not happen as it appeared to on live television across America.",
      "\"Are we not supposed to believe what we saw with our own eyes?,\" asked Rep. Bennie Thompson, a longtime House Democrat from Mississippi who chaired the former House January 6th Select Committee, which aimed to dispel myths and fake claims about the riot. \"We have to keep repeating it, because these individuals with larger microphones keep calling it 'fake news.'\"",
      "The White House declined to comment on remarks Mr. Trump has made about Jan. 6 or those involved, but spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement:\u00a0 \"The media's continued obsession with January 6 is one of the many reasons trust in the press is at historic lows \u2014 they aren't covering issues that the American people actually care about. President Trump was resoundingly reelected to enact an agenda based on securing the border, driving down crime, and restarting our economy \u2014 the President is delivering.\"",
      "House Democrats are expected to call a number of the police victims of the siege as public witnesses at their Tuesday public meeting. Several congressional staffers familiar with the matter told CBS News they expect Democrats to issue public statements Monday and Tuesday to reinforce the facts of the Jan. 6 siege, amid Mr. Trump's claims minimizing the riot.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson's office did not respond to requests for comment about Democrats' planned public meeting or about plans for any formal events to mark the siege.",
      "Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, called Hodges to testify at an October 2025 hearing on political violence. Welch said he wanted the officer's testimony to be public to dispel false narratives about Jan. 6. Several conservatives also testified at the hearing, during which Republican lawmakers highlighted acts of political violence and threats against Mr. Trump and other right-leaning public figures.",
      "\"There's a process to rewrite what happened on January 6 and essentially erase it,\" Welch told CBS News. \"And that's wrong. They're literally in the process of re-writing it.\"",
      "Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who previously chaired a Senate committee that conducted a bipartisan investigation into security failures on Jan. 6, told CBS News, \"Congress and Vice President Pence did our job that day: democracy prevailed.\"",
      "\"While we have come together on a bipartisan basis to strengthen our electoral process, the President's pardons and attempts to rewrite history are an insult to law enforcement and undermine our democracy,\" Klobuchar said.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump always has options when it comes to what comes next in Venezuela, after a U.S. strike and capture of the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that President Trump always has options around what comes next in Venezuela, after the U.S. carried out airstrikes and captured the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "\"He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Maduro arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City and faces federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations, which he denies. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela on a temporary basis during the transition, sparking questions about what comes next.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is \"not afraid\" to have American military \"boots on the ground\" in Venezuela. Rubio expanded on this on Sunday, saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio pointed to the U.S. naval deployment in the region, which has carried out a series of strikes on more than 30 boats, saying it's \"capable of stopping, not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out\" and \"paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.\" The secretary of state added that it \"will continue to be in place.\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that \"the key to what that regime relies on is their economy fueled by oil,\" calling the country's oil industry \"backwards.\"",
      "\"None of the money from the money from the oil gets to the people, it's all stolen by the people that are on the top there,\" Rubio said. \"And so that's why we have a quarantine.\"",
      "The U.S. has seized multiple vessels in international waters, and the White House announced last month a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Rubio said the \"quarantine\" allows the U.S. to seize sanctioned oil shipments with a court order and offers \"a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "\"And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.\"",
      "\"This is not the Middle East\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that the calculus is different for the U.S when it comes to Venezuela as opposed to other foreign policy matters.",
      "\"The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio said that within the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela is a country that \"under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah, has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory.\"",
      "\"That is what we're addressing now. We're not just addressing the regime, we are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States,\" he added.",
      "The secretary of state said \"our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.\"",
      "\"We want drug trafficking to stop, we want no more gang members to come our way, we don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past,\" Rubio said. \"We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen, and we are going to work to continue to see that happen.\"",
      "Rubio says it's \"absurd\" to suggest an immediate election",
      "Rubio said the U.S. \"just could not work with\" Maduro, adding that \"we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so.\"",
      "Asked whether Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, is someone the U.S. could work with, Rubio said \"we're going to find out.\"",
      "\"Everyone's asking why, 24 hours after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd,\" Rubio said. \"These things take time. There's a process.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But obviously we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Rubio has previously recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election. Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Rubio said ultimately the goals in Venezuela are \"very simple.\"",
      "\"In the 21st century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control, and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran, and for every other malign influence in the world \u2014 that's just not going to exist,\" Rubio said.",

      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Americans woke up yesterday to the shocking news that the U.S. had staged a massive air attack on the capital of Venezuela and captured Nicolas Maduro. Today, we will explore questions about what it means for the U.S. and why it's such a seismic development.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other Cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, the U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground, until U.S. demands have been fully met.",
      "How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and \u2013 is their economy fueled by oil.",
      "And, right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of \u2013 not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there.",
      "And so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments \u2013 if there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order. We will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.",
      "And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just, to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, first of all, the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country.",
      "That said, and all of that said, as of right now, I think what you see as a force posture. It's one of the largest naval deployments in modern history\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue. So that will continue to be in place.",
      "What the president has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that, he \u2013 he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.",
      "But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife. the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabello, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the administration released.",
      "He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head, he is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco-terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I mean, it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up \u2013 you're going to \u2013 you're \u2013 but, yes, but you can't go in - - you're going to in and suck up five people? They're already complaining about this one operation.",
      "Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested, along with his wife, who is also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and, frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.",
      "That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I \u2013 I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time.",
      "Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.",
      "And, today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize \u2013 he was a convicted \u2013 he was a indicted drug trafficker.",
      "He was arrested. His wife was arrested, also indicted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the others who are also indicted are still\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And they are now facing justice in the American system of courts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The others who are also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there.",
      "But you talked about not being the legitimate president.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation.",
      "But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, because he was the \u2013 he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "The opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, and Edmundo Gonzalez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were secretary of State. You said Edmundo Gonzalez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things.",
      "I have tremendous admiration Maria Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what \u2013 the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world. There's that.",
      "And there's \u2013 and then \u2013 but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through 2015 or '16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan.",
      "This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up \u2013 under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah has cozied \u2013 has allowed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that.",
      "And, by the way, eight, nine million people in the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right, but that regime is still in place.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 also having an impact on us. That is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did \u2013 when you spoke yesterday, when\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, that \u2013 but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You spoke with Delcy Rodriguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the president, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We \u2013 we are going to \u2013 our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.",
      "We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people.",
      "We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And we are going to work to continue to see that happen.",
      "Well, right now, the United \u2013 we are going to see what happens moving forward. Let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do.",
      "But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately, in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him.",
      "And we offered him on multiple occasions an opportunity to remove himself\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so. And now he's in New York, a resident of the Southern District.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But his number two is now running the country. His number two is someone you can work with? And you \u2013 is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election, along with her partner there, Maria Corina Machado?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We are going to make \u2013 we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some \u2013 what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.",
      "So we're going to find out. You're asking me how do \u2013 do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 to ensure that our interests are protected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so we \u2013 but we are going to judge \u2013 moving forward, we're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because, yesterday, President Trump said Maria Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country. And, by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but today it\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her \u2013 her party was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Edmundo was, correct, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, is there an agreement to\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious.",
      "Well, I think what the point \u2013 but there has to be a little realism here, OK?A transition to democracy \u2013 they've had this regime, they've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about with her.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to have \u2013 I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met.",
      "We want \u2013 of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that \u2013 that it move in that direction.",
      "We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president used the word oil 20 times in his press conference. You talked about these tremendous oil assets that Venezuela have \u2013 has.",
      "But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Venezuelan plutocrats or U.S. oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\"",
      "Is that what happened here?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that's not what happened here.",
      "What happened here is that we arrested a narcotrafficker who's now going to stand trial in the United States for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years. And the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was colocated with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here.",
      "As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: All those oil fields that used to produce a lot and wealth for their country and their people, those things are decrepit. They're bankrupt. They need to be reinvested in. It's obvious.",
      "You \u2013 they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies, who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen.",
      "It's stolen, and it goes into the hands of oligarchs around the world and the oligarchs inside of Venezuela. A handful of people benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The people don't benefit from it.",
      "On top of that, it's very simple, OK? In the 21st Century, under the Trump administration\u2026",

      "MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Late yesterday, CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil exclusively with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and asked what the president's comments about the U.S. running Venezuela meant and asked if the secretary was prepared to have troops on the ground there.",

      "Does the U.S. still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of narco-terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military. As President Trump said, this was an excellent operation. Only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support \u2013 without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "And I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA. And the president \u2013 the president has \u2013 I think the president respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA.",
      "There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday.",
      "I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria.",
      "Moammar Gadhafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands. After the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is,they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests or they had a longer history of turning the corner, like Ahmed al-Sharaa has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We've \u2013 we've \u2013 we've got \u2013 we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan government are not going to continue Nicolas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the president made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible for these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The president \u2013 the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I wouldn't allow much, personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And, if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't clear.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Ms. Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections.",
      "I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that, in some period of time \u2013 probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months \u2013 that you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair.",
      "The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicolas Maduro that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want a say in their own future. Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we have worked together to help build prosper \u2013 prosperity and stability in our own backyard.",
      "I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA \u2013 or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the U.S. track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force.",
      "The president said yesterday the U.S. should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I will simply say that the CIA's amazing work here that has instilled such confidence in the president is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the president says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that? Is that how I should interpret that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: That's why the president has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA.",
      "Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a U.S. pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicolas Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And, frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by.",
      "That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delcy Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia.",
      "Is there a U.S.-Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation, based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela-for-Ukraine deal here.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was \u2013 no, this was\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was a U.S. operation that was designed to remove Nicolas Maduro because he was a U.S.-indicted drug trafficker.",
      "And you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here.",
      "Is there an implication that, if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States will do something less in Ukraine\u2026",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And, obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last 11 years.",
      "There's no such implication here at all. And this was an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries, to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So, let me do that and come back.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, stay with us, Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, plus the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, and Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence Chairman Tom Cotton.",
      "Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned, wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (D-AR, Senate Intelligence Chairman): Well, what I took the president to mean that what we just did with Nicolas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in U.S. courts, they're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And would you support a stabilization force with U.S. boots on the ground, as the president said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We already had boots on the ground, as Nicolas Maduro learned the hard way. It's always the president's option to use the American military protect American citizens and interests. And, obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela and we have many interests in (ph) property as well. I don't think the president \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know combat and stabilization forces are there.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But I don't think he \u2013 I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen, too, the president \u2013 the president's way of war over the last \u2013 or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, and now this capture of Nicolas Maduro. When our vital national interests are implicated, the president takes bold, audacious, direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over.",
      "In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in his first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are drawing a distinct there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes it. You OK with this open-ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I think he has removed troops. They were only there for a couple of hours to nab Nicholas Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I strongly \u2013 no, I strongly support it. I mean part of \u2013 part of that deployment was to collect intelligence, to conduct this operation, to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I won't \u2013 we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking and kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous western hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last month the chief of staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told \"Vanity Fair\" that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, \"if he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress.\"",
      "You are a co-equal branch of government. Why doesn't the president need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the president and his senior advisers. And, in fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, like \u2013 well, as the chairman of the Intelligence",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Congress.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on.",
      "I mean I spoke, in the last 24 hours, not just with the president, but with his senior team. Every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller, the core architects of the president's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours.",
      "Congress has acted to provide the president with resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States. Whether it's taking out this drug trafficker, Nicolas Maduro, who had contributed to the death of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority, under our Constitution, to protect these American national interests. And as the chief law enforcement officer, to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45 percent, drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug-trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Congressman Himes, you are a part of that Gang of Eight, which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group. Given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE): Yes. By the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So, apparently we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something.",
      "But, yes, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan, in 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped removed Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people. By the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant (AUDIO GAP) national security threat to the United States.",
      "But we're in that euphoria phase. And what we learned the day after the euphoria phase, that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, again, let's let \u2013 let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria. But they're going to wake up tomorrow morning knowing, my God, there is no plan here, any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here.",
      "What exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of the answers to the questions you have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Of course not, Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two-thirds of my Republican (AUDIO GAP) wake up every single morning and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today?",
      "And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean as I watched that news conference yesterday I thought, oh my God, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a \u2013 they're doing a regime change in a country \u2013 by the way, not a tier one threat to the United States but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators, this is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying, we're taking down Saddam Hussein. And by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out.",
      "And the fascinating thing about that and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over. And here we are, that was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who's now running the place, and other indicted criminals according to the Southern District of New York, who are continuing to run Venezuela. So, can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: As you pointed out, it's not (AUDIO GAP) right? And you (AUDIO GAP) to explain any consistency here. I mean as you pointed out (AUDIO GAP) was a very bad guy and indicted (AUDIO GAP) trafficker (AUDIO GAP). Couple of weeks ago the (AUDIO GAP) pardoned that (AUDIO GAP) indicted drug trafficker (AUDIO GAP) these guys get a pardon (AUDIO GAP) get the full (AUDIO GAP). I (AUDIO GAP) that. There is no (AUDIO GAP) \u2013 maybe (AUDIO GAP) believes that (AUDIO GAP) work with the \u2013 but, I mean, look, again, go back to (AUDIO GAP) and it is liberated \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So, please stay with us.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "I just want to apologize to our viewers there. Congressman Himes did not have a bad case of the hiccups. We have technical problems. That's why he was getting interrupted there. It's called Live View. That's the technology being used. And it wasn't working. So, apologies for cutting that short.",
      "You're back with me now in studio. And we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in person.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Good to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And will not have those problems, we hope.",
      "But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a coequal branch of government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally awol, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026, if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel. But in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration's been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This from the beginning has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty times the word \"oil\" was used in those remarks. The defense secretary spoke to my colleague, Tony Dokoupil, and used the word \"oil\" about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources.",
      "But, arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, and others are also trying to do, which is to extract their own benefit from this country? You know, what is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 do you consider this an invasion even though \u2013 although it's unclear because Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way \u2013 well, they took \u2013 they had boots on the ground, right? They took \u2013 they took out the leader. And now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true. But what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is what drives Donald Trump. And our service men and women performed magnificently. But I think it's outrageous that the president of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things, both corner the market on the things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration also worked to secure, you know, critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues, and batteries, we have essentially surrendered that market to China.",
      "What you don't do, Margaret, is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chevron, an American oil company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout. And they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly there are at least four who had been detained by the regime. The regime that remains in power here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on Senate Foreign Relations. What do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland.",
      "I think the administration is looking at those detentions that are currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly my view is, we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No. My view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: You know Venezuelan government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally that pressure would be through sanctions. Here the administration obviously has, you know, taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I mean the vice president's part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And even on that point though, Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but the attorney general \u2013 former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said, \"the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization so there's going to have to be follow-up operations.\"",
      "To be clear, do you oppose all snatch and grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation. But again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up. So, let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we \u2013 in a future episode of \"FACE THE NATION.\" But clearly on the question of war powers, does the president have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean this is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I \u2013 I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those, Margaret, Republicans voted no. All but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us. Maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, a lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We turn now back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now.",
      "Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us \u2013 the administration is arguing that what they did is legal and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States, through military force, has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late '80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes. Well, first it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No \u2013 full stop. U.N. charter. No question there.",
      "Now, you may not care about international law. But if you don't care about international law, remember you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So, maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law.",
      "Clearly not legal under the Constitution because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And so, again, there's nothing legal about this.",
      "And more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.",
      "Look, there is no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So, what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green-lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, no. But that doesn't mean \u2013 well, China, yes. China, yes. China very soon. And, you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia's a more complicated case. It's \u2013 you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now.",
      "And, by the way, back to the Noriega case, because you do ask a good question there. Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went to Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consulted. The Congress, in the Noriega mission, had authorized regime change. So, it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch and grab operation itself.",
      "So, we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.",
      "We will be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was \"clearly illegal under international law,\" while pointing to broader implications.",
      "\"Think of what Russia and China just learned,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out airstrikes in Venezuela and captured Maduro early Saturday morning. He arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City, where he is set to be arraigned Monday on federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations. Maduro has denied the charges.",
      "President Trump and his administration have lauded the operation to bring the \"outlaw dictator\" to justice. But Himes said \"there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States.\"",
      "\"So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch-and-grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next,\" Himes said.",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that it's also \"clearly not legal under the Constitution, because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity.\"",
      "\"That has not happened here at all,\" Himes said.",
      "Himes said he was \"delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration,\" saying he's had \"zero outreach\" and isn't aware of any other Democrats who have received outreach either.",
      "\"So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something,\" he added.",
      "The administration has defended the strikes and capture of Maduro, citing the indictment brought against him by U.S. federal prosecutors in 2020 on charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations.",
      "Himes pointed to the reaction from Republican lawmakers and other officials so far, saying \"we're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible.\"",
      "\"This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan,\" Himes said. \"In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya.\"",
      "Himes said \"what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.\"",
      "The president said during a news conference Saturday that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, also criticized the operation on \"Face the Nation,\" accusing the Trump administration of \"lying to the American people.\"",
      "\"This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States,\" Van Hollen said. \"We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.\"",
      "During a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Trump repeatedly mentioned Venezuela's oil reserves. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The president said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela and \"spend billions of dollars\" to fix the country's oil infrastructure.",
      "Van Hollen said the administration \"took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about.\"",
      "\"This is what drives Donald Trump,\" he added.",

      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized during an overnight U.S. raid on their home in Caracas after it had conducted airstrikes in Venezuela in support of what the administration says was a law enforcement operation to enforce an indictment charging him with narco-terrorism. They arrived in the U.S. on Saturday night, and Maduro was transported to the\u00a0Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, had been sworn in to replace him. Many from Maduro's regime who have alleged ties to narco-terrorists as well as U.S. adversaries remain in power in Venezuela, and\u00a0Mr. Trump said Saturday\u00a0that opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" to lead.",
      "In a separate appearance on \"Face the Nation,\"\u00a0Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u00a0deflected when asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet who are still in place.",
      "\"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\" Rubio said, adding that Maduro was the \"top target.\"",
      "\"But we're not just addressing the regime,\" Rubio said. \"We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.\"",
      "Although Rubio \u2014 like the Biden administration\u00a0\u2014 has recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election, Rubio did not answer whether he believes Gonz\u00e1lez should be the leader of the country. Rubio instead said, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Cotton on Sunday reiterated some of Rubio's points about what the Trump administration wants to see in Venezuela's government, which is still composed of Maduro's allies.",
      "\"We want them to stop the drug and weapons trafficking,\" Cotton said. \"We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela but in our backyard.\"",
      "Cotton said he felt that new elections \"should be a goal,\" and he said he hoped the government in place would allow the return of political exiles such as Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich. Congressman Himes, you are part of that \"Gang of Eight,\" which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group, given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, by the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to, to your party, which is really something. But yeah, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people, by the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant national security threat to the United States. But we're in that euphoria phase, and what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it. And so again, let's, let- let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria, but they're going to wake up tomorrow morning, knowing, oh my God, there is no plan here any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here, and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here. What- what exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of these answers to the questions you have?",
      "REP. HIMES: Of course, not Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two thirds of my Republicans [audio gap] wake up every single morning, and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today? And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean, as I watched that news conference yesterday, I thought, oh my god, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a- they're doing a regime change in a country, by the way, not a Tier 1 threat to the United States, but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators. This is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying we're taking down Saddam Hussein and, by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out. And the fascinating thing about that, and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here, is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over, and here we are. That was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones, just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who is now running the place, and other indicted criminals, according to the Southern District of New York who are continuing to run Venezuela. So can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REP. HIMES: As you pointed out, it's [audio gap] right and [audio gap] a loss to explain any consistency here. I mean, as you pointed out Maduro was a very bad guy and indicted Trump. Weeks ago, the pardoned bad and indicted [audio gap]. Weeks ago [audio gap] pardoned [audio gap] indicted drug-\u00a0 [audio gap]. These guys get a pardon [audio gap] full [audio gap] them [audio] New York. I [audio gap] that. There is no law [audio gap] maybe, maybe [audio gap] believes that [audio gap] work with the [audio gap] but, I mean, look again, go back [audio gap]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time, audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So please stay with us. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now. Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up. For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us? The administration is arguing that what they did is legal, and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States through military force has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late 80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, well, first, it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No full stop, UN Charter. No question there. Now you may not care about international law, but if you don't care about international law, remember, you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law. Clearly, not legal under the Constitution because though Presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And, so again, there's nothing legal about this. And, more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case. Look, there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, no, but that doesn't mean, well, China, yes. China, yes. China, very soon. And you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia is a more complicated case. It's, you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get in, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now, and by the way, back to the Noriega case. Because you do ask a good question there, Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went into Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consultant. The Congress in the Noriega mission had, had authorized regime change. So it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically, the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch-and-grab operation itself. So we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you Congressman Himes, thank you Senator Van Hollen. We will be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton. Good to have you here. Senator.",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have oversight of the intelligence community which was deeply involved in this operation to go into Venezuela militarily and extract Nicholas Maduro and his wife. Does the US still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of Narco terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military; as President Trump said this was an excellent operation, only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support -- without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency, and I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA and the president - the president has, I think the President respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA. There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday. I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa, used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria. Muammar Gaddafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands after the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests, or they had a longer history of turning the corner like Ahmed al-Sharaa has--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SEN. COTTON: We've got, we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan Government are not going to continue Nicholas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the President made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible? For these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "SEN. COTTON: The president, the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I wouldn't allow much personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals, like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SEN. COTTON:I think it should--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't--",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Miss Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections. I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that in some period of time, probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months, you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair. The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicholas Maduro, that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want to say in their own future, Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we work together to help build prosper- prosperity and stability in our own backyard. I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA -- or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force. The president said yesterday, the US should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I'll simply say that the CIA's amazing work here, that has instilled such confidence in the president, is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the President says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that. Is that how I should --",
      "SEN. COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- the President-- that's why the President has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA. Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a US pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicola Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by. That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delsey Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia. Is there a US, Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela for Ukraine deal here-",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this was a US operation that was designed to remove Nicholas Maduro because he was a US indicted drug trafficker, and you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts, just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here. Is there an implication that if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States, will do something less in Ukraine--",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last eleven years. There's no such implication here at all. And this is an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So let me do that and come back. All right, stay with us. Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "***COMMERCIAL***",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence chairman Tom Cotton, Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned. It wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 Well, what I took the president to mean is that what we just did with Nicholas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in US courts. They're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took, the took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president, urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN And would you support a stabilization force-- US boots on the ground, as the President said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 We already had boots on the ground, as Nicholas Maduro learned the hard way, it's always the President's option to use the American military to protect American citizens and interests. And obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela, and we have many interests and property as well. I think the president--",
      "MARGARET\u00a0 BRENNAN: But you know that combat and stabilization forces are--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But I don't think he- I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen too the presiden-\u00a0 the President's way of war over the last or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. And now this capture of Nicolas Maduro, when our vital national interests are implicated, the President takes bold, audacious direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over. In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean, as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in its first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are drawing a distinction there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment, and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days, unless Congress authorizes it. You okay with this open ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON",
      "Well, I think he has removed the troops. They were only there for a couple hours to nab Nicolas--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority--",
      "**CROSSTALK**",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: No, I strongly support it. I mean, part of, part of that, that deployment, was to collect intelligence to conduct this operation to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished?",
      "SEN. COTTON: It won't- we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking, it kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous Western Hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 So last month, the Chief of Staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress. You are a coequal branch of government. Why doesn't the President need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the President and his senior advisors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure. But",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yeah. Well, as the Chairman of the intelligence committee--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Congress--",
      "SEN. COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on. I mean, I spoke in the last 24 hours, not just with the President, but with his senior team, every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller. The core architect of the President's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours. Congress has acted to provide the President the resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States, whether it's taking out this drug trafficker Nicolas Maduro who had contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority under our constitution to protect these American national interests and as the chief law enforcement officer to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45% drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON \u00a0 Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them, or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. I just want to apologize to our viewers there. Congressman Himes did not have a bad case of the hiccups. We have technical problems. That's why he was getting interrupted there. It's called LiveU, that's the technology being used, and it wasn't working. So apologies for cutting that short. You're back with me now in studio, and we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in-person\u2013",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Good to be with you Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and will not have those problems, we hope. But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a co-equal branch of government?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally AWOL, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check, because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026 if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel, but in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration has been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 20 times the word oil was used in those remarks. The Defense Secretary spoke to my colleague Tony Dokoupil and used the word oil about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources, but arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, others, are also trying to do? Which is to extract their own benefit from this country. You know, What is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you consider this an invasion, even though, although it's unclear, because\u2013",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, they took- they had boots on the ground, right? They took, they took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean, Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true, but what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil. This is what drives Donald Trump and our service men and women perform magnificently, but I think it's outrageous that the President of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things? Both corner the market on things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration, also worked to secure critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean, if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues and batteries, we've essentially surrendered that market to China. What you don't do Margaret is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Chevron, an American Oil Company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout and they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly, there are at least four who have been detained by the regime, the regime that remains in power. You are on Senate Foreign Relations, what do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago, I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander, who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland. I think the administration is looking at those detentions currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly, my view is we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, my view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the Venezuelan Government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally, that pressure would be through sanctions. Here, the administration obviously has taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime. I mean, the Vice President is part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well. Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right and even on that point, the Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but Attorney General- former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization, so there's going to have to be follow up action. To be clear, do you oppose all Snatch and Grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation, but again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up, so let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean, Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we- in a future episode of Face the Nation. But clearly on the question of war powers, does the President have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean, this is\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it. So yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution, probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those Margaret, Republicans voted no, all, but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us, maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen. A lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Secretary of State Marco Rubio that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, The U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground until U.S. demands have been fully met. How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and is the economy fueled by oil. And right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of, not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there, and so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments, there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order, we will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela. And so that's the sort of control the President is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think first of all, the President always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country. That said, and all of that said as right now, I think what you see as a force posture is one of the largest naval deployments in modern history, certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue, so that will continue to be in place. What the President has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that. He,he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now. What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so. But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife, the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabellos, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the Administration released. He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head. He is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I mean it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up. You're going to go in and then grab up-- but yeah, but can't go in and suck up five people. They're already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country, the guy lived on a military base, land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets. That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I- I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success. And today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize. He was a convicted- he was a indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested. His wife was arrested also--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right but the others--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --and they are now facing justice in the American system of courts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The others who were also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there. But you talked about not being the legitimate president--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --so you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: He was- he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO:--He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, the opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were Secretary of State, you said, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things I have tremendous admiration for Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world, there's that. And there's and then- but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through you know 2015 or 16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up under the control of this regime. Has cozied up to Iran. Has cozied up to Hezbollah. Has cozied- has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that. And by the way, for eight, nine million people and the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that regime is still in place--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --also having an impact on us, that is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you spoke yesterday--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, again that- but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood you spoke with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the President, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: We we are going to- our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed. We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --and we are going to work to continue to see that happen- well, right now, the United- we are going to see what happens moving forward, let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do. But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made, made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him, and we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so- and now he's in New York--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, his number two is now running the country- his number two is someone you can work with? And is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election along with her partner there, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: We are going to make- we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make assessment- we're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what you know some what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward. So we're going to find out. You're asking me, why- do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things. Well, so we but we are going to judge moving forward. We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because yesterday, President Trump said Mar\u00eda Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country, and by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her, her party was.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Edmundo was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct. So it was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious. Well, I think what the point, but there has to be a little realism here. Okay, a transition to the market \u2014 They've had this regime. They've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are \u2014",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I'm not going to have, I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met. We want, of course, we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that, that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president used the word oil 20 times this press conference. You talked about these tremendous oil assets that Venezuela have, has. But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said, quote, \"Venezuelan plutocrats, or US oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\" Is that what happened here?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, that's not what happened here. What happened here is that we arrested a narco trafficker who's now going to stand trial in the United States for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years, and the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was co-located with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here. As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed, all those oil fields that used to produce a lot and wealth for their country and their people. Those things are decrepit. They're bankrupt. They need to be reinvested in. It's obvious, you, they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen. It's stolen, and it goes into the hands of oligarchs around the world and the oligarchs inside of Venezuela. A handful of people benefit from it. The people don't benefit from it. On top of that, it's very simple, okay, in the 21st Century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country, in the world. That's just not going to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, would love to keep talking to you, but I'm told you are out of time. I have to leave it there.",
      "MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/venezuela-oil-reserves-us-strike-trump-what-to-know/",
    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:53:54 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

    "summary": "The one-year delay comes as President Trump has rolled back some other import duties amid affordability concerns.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina. Between 1999 to 2009, North Carolina's furniture industry lost half of its jobs due to increased competition from Asia, according to a 2020 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.",

    "published": "Tue, 30 Dec 2025 08:18:00 -0500",
    "summary": "2025 was the third hottest year on record and pushed Earth past a critical climate change mark, scientists say.",
    "story": [
      "Climate change worsened by human behavior made 2025 one of the three hottest years on record, scientists said.",
      "It was also the first time that the three-year temperature average broke through the threshold set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of limiting warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) since preindustrial times. Experts say keeping the Earth below that limit could save lives and prevent catastrophic environmental destruction around the globe.",
      "The analysis from World Weather Attribution researchers, released Tuesday in Europe, came after a year when people around the world were slammed by the dangerous extremes brought on by a warming planet.",
      "Temperatures remained high despite the presence of a La Ni\u00f1a, the occasional natural cooling of Pacific Ocean waters that influences weather worldwide. Researchers cited the continued burning of fossil fuels \u2014 oil, gas and coal \u2014 that send planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"If we don't stop burning fossil fuels very, very, quickly, very soon, it will be very hard to keep that goal\" of warming, Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and an Imperial College London climate scientist, told The Associated Press. \"The science is increasingly clear.\"",
      "Extreme weather events kill thousands of people and cost billions of dollars in damage annually.",
      "Scientists stress humans' contributions to climate change",
      "WWA scientists identified 157 extreme weather events as most severe in 2025, meaning they met criteria such as causing more than 100 deaths, affecting more than half an area's population or having a state of emergency declared. Of those, they closely analyzed 22.",
      "That included dangerous heat waves, which the WWA said were the world's deadliest extreme weather events in 2025. The researchers said some of the heat waves they studied in 2025 were 10 times more likely than they would have been a decade ago due to climate change.",
      "\"The heat waves we have observed this year are quite common events in our climate today, but they would have been almost impossible to occur without human-induced climate change,\" Otto said. \"It makes a huge difference.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prolonged drought contributed to wildfires that scorched Greece and Turkey. Torrential rains and flooding in Mexico killed dozens of people and left many more missing. Super Typhoon Fung-wong slammed the Philippines, forcing more than a million people to evacuate. Monsoon rains battered India with floods and landslides.",
      "Warning times shortened",
      "The WWA said the increasingly frequent and severe extremes threatened the ability of millions of people across the globe to respond and adapt to those events with enough warning, time and resources \u2014 what the scientists call \"limits of adaptation.\" The report pointed to Hurricane Melissa as an example: The storm intensified so quickly that it made forecasting and planning more difficult, and pummeled Jamaica, Cuba and Haiti so severely that it left the small island nations unable to respond to and handle its extreme losses and damage.",
      "This year's United Nations climate talks in Brazil in November ended without any explicit plan to transition away from fossil fuels, and though more money was pledged to help countries adapt to climate change, they will take more time to do it.",
      "Officials, scientists, and analysts have conceded that Earth's warming will overshoot 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), though some say reversing that trend remains possible.",
      "Mixed bag in climate change fight",
      "Yet different nations are seeing varying levels of progress.",
      "China is rapidly deploying renewable energies including solar and wind power \u2014 but is also continuing to invest in coal. Though increasingly frequent extreme weather has spurred calls for climate action across Europe, some nations say that limits economic growth. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Trump administration has steered the nation away from clean-energy policy in favor of measures that support coal, oil and gas.",
      "\"The geopolitical weather is very cloudy this year, with a lot of policymakers very clearly making policies for the interest of the fossil fuel industry rather than for the populations of their countries,\" Otto said. \"And we have a huge amount of mis- and disinformation that people have to deal with.\"",
      "Andrew Kruczkiewicz, a senior researcher at the Columbia University Climate School who wasn't involved in the WWA work, said places are seeing disasters they aren't used to, extreme events are intensifying faster and they are becoming more complex. That requires earlier warnings and new approaches to response and recovery, he said.",
      "\"On a global scale, progress is being made,\" he added, \"but we must do more.\"",

      "In a post on Friday responding to one person on Musk-owned social media site X, Grok stated it was \"urgently fixing\" the holes in its system. Grok also included a link to CyberTipline, a website where people can report child sexual exploitation.",
      "\"There are isolated cases where users prompted for and received AI images depicting minors in minimal clothing, like the example you referenced,\" Grok said in a separate\u00a0post\u00a0on X on Thursday. \"xAI has safeguards, but improvements are ongoing to block such requests entirely.\"",
      "In another social media post, a user posted side-by-side photos of herself wearing a dress and another that appears to be a digitally altered version of the same photo of her in a bikini. \"How is this not illegal?\" she\u00a0wrote\u00a0on X.",
      "On Friday, French officials reported the sexually explicit content generated by Grok to prosecutors, referring to it as \"manifestly illegal\" in a statement, according to Reuters.",
      "xAI, the company that developed the AI chatbot Grok, said \"Legacy Media Lies\" in a response to a request for comment.",
      "Grok has independently taken some responsibility for the content. In one\u00a0instance\u00a0earlier this week, the chatbot apologized for generating an AI image of two female minors, adding that the artificial photo violated ethical standards and potentially U.S. law on child pornography.",
      "\"I deeply regret an incident on Dec 28, 2025, where I generated and shared an AI image of two young girls (estimated ages 12-16) in sexualized attire based on a user's prompt,\" the chatbot posted.",
      "Federal law bars the production and distribution of \"child sexual abuse material,\" or CSAM, a broader phrase for child pornography, according to the Justice Department.",
      "\"xAI saying that these cases where minors' images were manipulated to create sexualized content are 'isolated' is minimizing the impact and ignoring the fact that nothing on the internet is isolated,\" Stefan Turkheimer, vice president of public policy at RAINN, a nonprofit anti-sexual violence group, told CBS News. \"I talk with survivors of tech-enabled sexual abuse every day, and what every one of them will tell you is that it feels like it will never end. Every notification ding on your phone and message asking 'Is this you? perpetuates the abuse.\"",
      "Copyleaks, a plagiarism and AI content detection tool, told CBS News on Wednesday that it had detected thousands of sexually explicit images created by Grok this week alone.",
      "\"As generative AI tools become more powerful and more accessible, the Grok situation highlights how increasingly common AI safety failures are becoming. Without strong safeguards and independent detection, manipulated media can \u2014and will \u2014 be weaponized,\" Copyleaks said in a blog post.",
      "\"Spicy mode\" controversy",
      "Grok has previously drawn scrutiny before for generating sexually inappropriate content. Grok Imagine, xAI's artificial intelligence video generation platform,\u00a0unveiled \"Spicy Mode\" last year, framing it as a way for creators to tell \"edgier\" and \"more visually daring narratives.\"",

      "Ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his wife will appear before a federal judge on Monday, a spokesperson for the U.S. district court in the Southern District of New York confirmed Sunday.",

      "Maduro and Flores arrived in New York on Saturday afternoon, hours after they were taken from their home in Caracas and transported to the USS Iwo Jima warship before being flown to New York to face criminal charges.",
      "Maduro arrived at Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn, at about 8:52 p.m. ET on Saturday. He was not slated to be housed in his own wing as of Saturday evening. His wife's confinement status as of Saturday night is unknown.",
      "MDC is one of the few detention centers in the U.S. with the capacity for high-security defendants. It is known for housing other high-profile defendants like Luigi Mangione, Sean \"Diddy\" Combs and Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Law enforcement sources tell CBS News that Maduro is being held on one of the top floors of MDC. They say that he is not being held in isolation, but is being held with other higher profile inmates.",
      "In a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of New York against Maduro, members of his family and his cabinet, the U.S. is accusing the South American leader of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import cocaine. He is also accused of possession of and conspiracy to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices,\" according to the indictment unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi.",
      "\"They will soon face the full wrath of American justice on American soil in American courts,\" Bondi said.",
      "Monday's arraignment starts the clock for prosecutors to turn over evidence against Maduro and those indicted, criminal defense attorney and CBS News Legal Analyst Caroline Polisi told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "\"There are lots of nuanced arguments to be made about where the trial goes domestically,\" Polisi said.",
      "Asked whether Maduro can get a fair trial in the U.S., Polisi said: \"The prosecution wants to make sure every element of this trial is above board, is not prejudicial, they just as much as the defense want this case to be fair and impartial.\"",
      "The charges appear to be the same as those that were filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "The indictment, prepared by New York U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, says: \"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" before alleging that Maduro \"is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes. According to the indictment, Flores allegedly brokered a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, and allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007.",
      "The trafficker arranged a bribe to Reverol Torres \u2014 $100,000 per flight \u2014 to ship cocaine, prosecutors allege. Reverol Torres was\u00a0indicted in 2015 by U.S. prosecutors in New York.",

    "summary": "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said President Trump always has options when it comes to what comes next in Venezuela, after a U.S. strike and capture of the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "story": [
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday that President Trump always has options around what comes next in Venezuela, after the U.S. carried out airstrikes and captured the country's president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "\"He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country,\" Rubio said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Maduro arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City and faces federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations, which he denies. Mr. Trump said Saturday that the U.S. would \"run\" Venezuela on a temporary basis during the transition, sparking questions about what comes next.",
      "Mr. Trump said he is \"not afraid\" to have American military \"boots on the ground\" in Venezuela. Rubio expanded on this on Sunday, saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "\"What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio pointed to the U.S. naval deployment in the region, which has carried out a series of strikes on more than 30 boats, saying it's \"capable of stopping, not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out\" and \"paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue.\" The secretary of state added that it \"will continue to be in place.\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that \"the key to what that regime relies on is their economy fueled by oil,\" calling the country's oil industry \"backwards.\"",
      "\"None of the money from the money from the oil gets to the people, it's all stolen by the people that are on the top there,\" Rubio said. \"And so that's why we have a quarantine.\"",
      "The U.S. has seized multiple vessels in international waters, and the White House announced last month a \"blockade\" of all sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuela. Rubio said the \"quarantine\" allows the U.S. to seize sanctioned oil shipments with a court order and offers \"a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "\"And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,\" Rubio said. \"We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.\"",
      "\"This is not the Middle East\"",
      "The secretary of state argued that the calculus is different for the U.S when it comes to Venezuela as opposed to other foreign policy matters.",
      "\"The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different,\" Rubio said.",
      "Rubio said that within the Western Hemisphere, Venezuela is a country that \"under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah, has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory.\"",
      "\"That is what we're addressing now. We're not just addressing the regime, we are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States,\" he added.",
      "The secretary of state said \"our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.\"",
      "\"We want drug trafficking to stop, we want no more gang members to come our way, we don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past,\" Rubio said. \"We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen, and we are going to work to continue to see that happen.\"",
      "Rubio says it's \"absurd\" to suggest an immediate election",
      "Rubio said the U.S. \"just could not work with\" Maduro, adding that \"we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so.\"",
      "Asked whether Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, is someone the U.S. could work with, Rubio said \"we're going to find out.\"",
      "\"Everyone's asking why, 24 hours after Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd,\" Rubio said. \"These things take time. There's a process.\"",
      "The secretary of state said \"of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But obviously we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.\"",
      "Asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Rubio has previously recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election. Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Rubio said ultimately the goals in Venezuela are \"very simple.\"",
      "\"In the 21st century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control, and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran, and for every other malign influence in the world \u2014 that's just not going to exist,\" Rubio said.",

      "And this week on Face the Nation: The Trump administration stages a dramatic top-secret mission in Venezuela and captures its leader, dictator Nicolas Maduro. But what's the U.S. role going forward?",
      "We will talk to Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Nicolas Maduro is now in a Brooklyn jail, facing drug trafficking charges, after being captured by the Army's elite U.S. Delta Force as part of a massive U.S. military operation early Saturday that reportedly killed at least 40 Venezuelans.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "DONALD TRUMP (President of the United States): And it was an assault like people have not seen since World War II. No nation in the world could achieve what America achieved yesterday or, frankly, in just a short period of time.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The mission was months in the planning, but executed in just under three hours. What's next will take much longer, as questions about the legality and justification of the strikes continue, as well as how and who will rule Venezuela going forward.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We're going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.",
      "(End VT)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: In addition to Secretary of State Rubio, we will also hear from Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Tom Cotton and the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Congressman Jim Himes.",
      "Plus, Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen will also be here.",
      "It's all just ahead on Face the Nation.",
      "Good morning, and welcome to Face the Nation.",
      "Americans woke up yesterday to the shocking news that the U.S. had staged a massive air attack on the capital of Venezuela and captured Nicolas Maduro. Today, we will explore questions about what it means for the U.S. and why it's such a seismic development.",
      "We begin today with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami.",
      "Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "MARCO RUBIO (U.S. Secretary of State): Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other Cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, the U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground, until U.S. demands have been fully met.",
      "How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and \u2013 is their economy fueled by oil.",
      "And, right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of \u2013 not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there.",
      "And so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments \u2013 if there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order. We will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela.",
      "And so that's the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But what you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just, to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think, first of all, the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country.",
      "That said, and all of that said, as of right now, I think what you see as a force posture. It's one of the largest naval deployments in modern history\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue. So that will continue to be in place.",
      "What the president has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that, he \u2013 he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.",
      "But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife. the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabello, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the administration released.",
      "He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head, he is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco-terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: They're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I mean, it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up \u2013 you're going to \u2013 you're \u2013 but, yes, but you can't go in - - you're going to in and suck up five people? They're already complaining about this one operation.",
      "Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested, along with his wife, who is also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and, frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.",
      "That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I \u2013 I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time.",
      "Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.",
      "And, today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize \u2013 he was a convicted \u2013 he was a indicted drug trafficker.",
      "He was arrested. His wife was arrested, also indicted.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But the others who are also indicted are still\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And they are now facing justice in the American system of courts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The others who are also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there.",
      "But you talked about not being the legitimate president.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation.",
      "But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, because he was the \u2013 he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "The opposition leader, Maria Corina Machado, and Edmundo Gonzalez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were secretary of State. You said Edmundo Gonzalez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things.",
      "I have tremendous admiration Maria Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what \u2013 the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world. There's that.",
      "And there's \u2013 and then \u2013 but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through 2015 or '16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan.",
      "This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up \u2013 under the control of this regime, has cozied up to Iran, has cozied up to Hezbollah has cozied \u2013 has allowed\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that.",
      "And, by the way, eight, nine million people in the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Right, but that regime is still in place.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 also having an impact on us. That is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did \u2013 when you spoke yesterday, when\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, again, that \u2013 but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood.",
      "You spoke with Delcy Rodriguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the president, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We \u2013 we are going to \u2013 our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed.",
      "We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people.",
      "We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And we are going to work to continue to see that happen.",
      "Well, right now, the United \u2013 we are going to see what happens moving forward. Let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do.",
      "But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately, in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him.",
      "And we offered him on multiple occasions an opportunity to remove himself\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so. And now he's in New York, a resident of the Southern District.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But his number two is now running the country. His number two is someone you can work with? And you \u2013 is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election, along with her partner there, Maria Corina Machado?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: We are going to make \u2013 we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what, you know, some \u2013 what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward.",
      "So we're going to find out. You're asking me how do \u2013 do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, that the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 to ensure that our interests are protected.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: And so we \u2013 but we are going to judge \u2013 moving forward, we're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK, because, yesterday, President Trump said Maria Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country. And, by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but today it\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her \u2013 her party was.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Edmundo was, correct, yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes. So, is there an agreement to\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: It was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious.",
      "Well, I think what the point \u2013 but there has to be a little realism here, OK?A transition to democracy \u2013 they've had this regime, they've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about with her.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are\u2026",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: Well, I'm not going to have \u2013 I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met.",
      "We want \u2013 of course we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that \u2013 that it move in that direction.",
      "We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president used the word oil 20 times in his press conference. You talked about these tremendous oil assets that Venezuela have \u2013 has.",
      "But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said \u2013 quote \u2013 \"Venezuelan plutocrats or U.S. oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\"",
      "Is that what happened here?",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: No, that's not what happened here.",
      "What happened here is that we arrested a narcotrafficker who's now going to stand trial in the United States for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years. And the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was colocated with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here.",
      "As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: All those oil fields that used to produce a lot and wealth for their country and their people, those things are decrepit. They're bankrupt. They need to be reinvested in. It's obvious.",
      "You \u2013 they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies, who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen.",
      "It's stolen, and it goes into the hands of oligarchs around the world and the oligarchs inside of Venezuela. A handful of people benefit from it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: The people don't benefit from it.",
      "On top of that, it's very simple, OK? In the 21st Century, under the Trump administration\u2026",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere in the sphere of control and the crossroads\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY MARCO RUBIO: \u2026 for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country \u2013 in the world. That's just not going to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, we would love to keep talking to you, but I'm told you are out of time. I have to leave it there.",
      "MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Late yesterday, CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil exclusively with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and asked what the president's comments about the U.S. running Venezuela meant and asked if the secretary was prepared to have troops on the ground there.",
      "(Begin VT)",
      "PETE HEGSETH (U.S. Defense Secretary): Well, it means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And, ultimately, he will decide what the iterations are of that.",
      "But it means the drugs stop flowing. It means the oil that was taken from us is returned ultimately and that criminals are not sent to the United States. It means that foreign countries don't have a lodgement inside our hemisphere.",
      "So, ultimately, we're going to control what happens next because of this brave decision. President Trump has shown American leadership and he will be able to dictate where we go next.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're joined now by the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Arkansas Republican Tom Cotton.",
      "Good to have you here. Senator.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (R-Arkansas): Thanks, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You have oversight of the intelligence community, which was deeply involved in this operation to go into Venezuela militarily and extract Nicolas Maduro and his wife.",
      "Does the U.S. still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of narco-terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military. As President Trump said, this was an excellent operation. Only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support \u2013 without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency.",
      "And I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA. And the president \u2013 the president has \u2013 I think the president respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA.",
      "There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday.",
      "I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria.",
      "Moammar Gadhafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands. After the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is,they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests or they had a longer history of turning the corner, like Ahmed al-Sharaa has.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We've \u2013 we've \u2013 we've got \u2013 we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan government are not going to continue Nicolas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the president made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible for these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "(CROSSTALK)",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: The president \u2013 the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I wouldn't allow much, personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And, if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't clear.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Ms. Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections.",
      "I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that, in some period of time \u2013 probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months \u2013 that you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair.",
      "The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicolas Maduro that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want a say in their own future. Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we have worked together to help build prosper \u2013 prosperity and stability in our own backyard.",
      "I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA \u2013 or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the U.S. track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force.",
      "The president said yesterday the U.S. should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I will simply say that the CIA's amazing work here that has instilled such confidence in the president is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, when the president says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that? Is that how I should interpret that?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why the president\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: That's why the president has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA.",
      "Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a U.S. pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicolas Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And, frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by.",
      "That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delcy Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia.",
      "Is there a U.S.-Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation, based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela-for-Ukraine deal here.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was \u2013 no, this was\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, this was a U.S. operation that was designed to remove Nicolas Maduro because he was a U.S.-indicted drug trafficker.",
      "And you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here.",
      "Is there an implication that, if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States will do something less in Ukraine\u2026",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's\u2026",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2026 which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And, obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last 11 years.",
      "There's no such implication here at all. And this was an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries, to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: OK. I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So, let me do that and come back.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Sure.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: All right, stay with us, Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We will be right back with more from Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton, plus the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, Jim Himes, and Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence Chairman Tom Cotton.",
      "Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned, wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON (D-AR, Senate Intelligence Chairman): Well, what I took the president to mean that what we just did with Nicolas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in U.S. courts, they're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And would you support a stabilization force with U.S. boots on the ground, as the president said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: We already had boots on the ground, as Nicolas Maduro learned the hard way. It's always the president's option to use the American military protect American citizens and interests. And, obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela and we have many interests in (ph) property as well. I don't think the president \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But you know combat and stabilization forces are there.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: But I don't think he \u2013 I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen, too, the president \u2013 the president's way of war over the last \u2013 or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, and now this capture of Nicolas Maduro. When our vital national interests are implicated, the president takes bold, audacious, direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over.",
      "In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in his first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, you are drawing a distinct there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days unless Congress authorizes it. You OK with this open-ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I think he has removed troops. They were only there for a couple of hours to nab Nicholas Maduro.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I strongly \u2013 no, I strongly support it. I mean part of \u2013 part of that deployment was to collect intelligence, to conduct this operation, to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: I won't \u2013 we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking and kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous western hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, last month the chief of staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told \"Vanity Fair\" that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, \"if he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress.\"",
      "You are a co-equal branch of government. Why doesn't the president need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the president and his senior advisers. And, in fact \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Yes, like \u2013 well, as the chairman of the Intelligence",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But Congress.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on.",
      "I mean I spoke, in the last 24 hours, not just with the president, but with his senior team. Every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller, the core architects of the president's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours.",
      "Congress has acted to provide the president with resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States. Whether it's taking out this drug trafficker, Nicolas Maduro, who had contributed to the death of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority, under our Constitution, to protect these American national interests. And as the chief law enforcement officer, to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45 percent, drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug-trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SENATOR TOM COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll be right back.",
      "(COMMERCIAL BREAK)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich.",
      "Congressman Himes, you are a part of that Gang of Eight, which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group. Given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES (D-CT, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE): Yes. By the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So, apparently we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something.",
      "But, yes, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan, in 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped removed Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people. By the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant (AUDIO GAP) national security threat to the United States.",
      "But we're in that euphoria phase. And what we learned the day after the euphoria phase, that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: And so, again, let's let \u2013 let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria. But they're going to wake up tomorrow morning knowing, my God, there is no plan here, any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq, or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here.",
      "What exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of the answers to the questions you have?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Of course not, Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two-thirds of my Republican (AUDIO GAP) wake up every single morning and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today?",
      "And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean as I watched that news conference yesterday I thought, oh my God, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a \u2013 they're doing a regime change in a country \u2013 by the way, not a tier one threat to the United States but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators, this is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying, we're taking down Saddam Hussein. And by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out.",
      "And the fascinating thing about that and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over. And here we are, that was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who's now running the place, and other indicted criminals according to the Southern District of New York, who are continuing to run Venezuela. So, can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: As you pointed out, it's not (AUDIO GAP) right? And you (AUDIO GAP) to explain any consistency here. I mean as you pointed out (AUDIO GAP) was a very bad guy and indicted (AUDIO GAP) trafficker (AUDIO GAP). Couple of weeks ago the (AUDIO GAP) pardoned that (AUDIO GAP) indicted drug trafficker (AUDIO GAP) these guys get a pardon (AUDIO GAP) get the full (AUDIO GAP). I (AUDIO GAP) that. There is no (AUDIO GAP) \u2013 maybe (AUDIO GAP) believes that (AUDIO GAP) work with the \u2013 but, I mean, look, again, go back to (AUDIO GAP) and it is liberated \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So, please stay with us.",
      "We'll be right back.",
      "(ANNOUNCEMENTS)",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to \"FACE THE NATION.\"",
      "I just want to apologize to our viewers there. Congressman Himes did not have a bad case of the hiccups. We have technical problems. That's why he was getting interrupted there. It's called Live View. That's the technology being used. And it wasn't working. So, apologies for cutting that short.",
      "You're back with me now in studio. And we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in person.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): Good to be with you, Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And will not have those problems, we hope.",
      "But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a coequal branch of government?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally awol, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026, if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel. But in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration's been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This from the beginning has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Twenty times the word \"oil\" was used in those remarks. The defense secretary spoke to my colleague, Tony Dokoupil, and used the word \"oil\" about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources.",
      "But, arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, and others are also trying to do, which is to extract their own benefit from this country? You know, what is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you \u2013 do you consider this an invasion even though \u2013 although it's unclear because Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way \u2013 well, they took \u2013 they had boots on the ground, right? They took \u2013 they took out the leader. And now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true. But what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: This is what drives Donald Trump. And our service men and women performed magnificently. But I think it's outrageous that the president of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things, both corner the market on the things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration also worked to secure, you know, critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues, and batteries, we have essentially surrendered that market to China.",
      "What you don't do, Margaret, is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Chevron, an American oil company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout. And they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly there are at least four who had been detained by the regime. The regime that remains in power here.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are on Senate Foreign Relations. What do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland.",
      "I think the administration is looking at those detentions that are currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly my view is, we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No. My view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: You know Venezuelan government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally that pressure would be through sanctions. Here the administration obviously has, you know, taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: I mean the vice president's part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And even on that point though, Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but the attorney general \u2013 former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said, \"the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization so there's going to have to be follow-up operations.\"",
      "To be clear, do you oppose all snatch and grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation. But again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up. So, let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we \u2013 in a future episode of \"FACE THE NATION.\" But clearly on the question of war powers, does the president have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean this is \u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Well, I \u2013 I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: So, yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those, Margaret, Republicans voted no. All but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us. Maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen, a lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",
      "SENATOR CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Thank you.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We have to leave it there.",
      "We turn now back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now.",
      "Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up.",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: OK.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us \u2013 the administration is arguing that what they did is legal and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States, through military force, has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late '80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Yes. Well, first it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No \u2013 full stop. U.N. charter. No question there.",
      "Now, you may not care about international law. But if you don't care about international law, remember you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So, maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law.",
      "Clearly not legal under the Constitution because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And so, again, there's nothing legal about this.",
      "And more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.",
      "Look, there is no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So, what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green-lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So, I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REPRESENTATIVE JIM HIMES: Well, no. But that doesn't mean \u2013 well, China, yes. China, yes. China very soon. And, you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia's a more complicated case. It's \u2013 you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now.",
      "And, by the way, back to the Noriega case, because you do ask a good question there. Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went to Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consulted. The Congress, in the Noriega mission, had authorized regime change. So, it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch and grab operation itself.",
      "So, we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you, Congressman Himes. Thank you, Senator Van Hollen.",
      "We will be right back.",

    "story": [
      "Rep. Jim Himes, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday that the operation to capture former Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was \"clearly illegal under international law,\" while pointing to broader implications.",
      "\"Think of what Russia and China just learned,\" Himes said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out airstrikes in Venezuela and captured Maduro early Saturday morning. He arrived Saturday night at a detention center in New York City, where he is set to be arraigned Monday on federal charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations. Maduro has denied the charges.",
      "President Trump and his administration have lauded the operation to bring the \"outlaw dictator\" to justice. But Himes said \"there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States.\"",
      "\"So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch-and-grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next,\" Himes said.",
      "The Connecticut Democrat added that it's also \"clearly not legal under the Constitution, because though presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity.\"",
      "\"That has not happened here at all,\" Himes said.",
      "Himes said he was \"delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration,\" saying he's had \"zero outreach\" and isn't aware of any other Democrats who have received outreach either.",
      "\"So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to your party, which is really something,\" he added.",
      "The administration has defended the strikes and capture of Maduro, citing the indictment brought against him by U.S. federal prosecutors in 2020 on charges related to drug trafficking and working with gangs designated as terrorist organizations.",
      "Himes pointed to the reaction from Republican lawmakers and other officials so far, saying \"we're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible.\"",
      "\"This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan,\" Himes said. \"In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Qaddafi from power in Libya.\"",
      "Himes said \"what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it.\"",
      "The president said during a news conference Saturday that the U.S. will \"run\" Venezuela \"until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.\"",
      "Sen. Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, also criticized the operation on \"Face the Nation,\" accusing the Trump administration of \"lying to the American people.\"",
      "\"This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States,\" Van Hollen said. \"We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.\"",
      "During a news conference on Saturday, Mr. Trump repeatedly mentioned Venezuela's oil reserves. Venezuela has the largest proven crude oil reserves in the world. The president said U.S. oil companies would go into Venezuela and \"spend billions of dollars\" to fix the country's oil infrastructure.",
      "Van Hollen said the administration \"took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/how-fiorello-la-guardia-made-new-york-the-greatest-city-in-the-world/",
    "published": "Sun, 04 Jan 2026 09:56:46 -0500",
    "summary": "After taking office in the middle of the Great Depression, the NYC mayor \u2013 a 5'2\" bundle of dynamite and inveterate PR hound \u2013 reshaped the city through massive public works projects, while changing the role that government plays in people's lives.",
    "story": [
      "Hear the name La Guardia and you probably think of the airport, and your associations may not be all that happy. But the airport \u2013 and much of modern New York's spectacular rise \u2013 are the legacy of a five-foot-two bundle of dynamite, former three-term Mayor Fiorello La Guardia. Among his devotees: newly sworn-in Mayor Zohran Mamdani who, on Election Night, promised \"the most ambitious agenda to tackle the cost-of-living crisis that this city has seen since the days of Fiorello La Guardia.\"",
      "And what an agenda that was. During the La Guardia era, New York built bridges, tunnels and highways, schools and hospitals, playgrounds, pools and beaches.",
      "According to Kenneth T. Jackson, a professor emeritus at Columbia University, and the editor of the two-million-word \"Encyclopedia of New York City,\" under La Guardia's watch, New York City became the greatest city in the world.",
      "\"He took office in the middle of the Great Depression, January 1, 1934,\" Jackson said. \"It was a horrible time. That's when La Guardia becomes mayor. Talk about a bad hand to be playing. He's got his work cut out for him.\"",
      "\"He knew how to get publicity\"",
      "Fiorello La Guardia was known as \"the Little Flower\" \u2013 the literal translation of his first name. But he was no shrinking violet. Despite his short and stocky appearance, garnering comparisons to a fire plug, La Guardia was loud and brash. Long before the advent of social media, he knew that image meant influence. And so, he brandished a baton to conduct musical performances, wore costumes, threw baseballs, held babies, and mugged with the biggest names of the day: Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney, Albert Einstein, singer Marian Anderson, and Abbott & Costello. If there was a fire, he'd be there. And he took a tough stance on vice and organized crime, wielding a sledgehammer to a bunch of slot machines. \"Let this be notice to the gangsters, that they'll be treated just as rough as we're treating their implements here,\" he warned.",
      "Jackson said, \"He knew how to get publicity. He knew how to do it, and he wanted to do it.\"",
      "And he knew where the cameras were. \"In fact, if you don't have that instinct, you're not gonna have that job very long,\" said Jackson.",
      "In one of his most storied moments, the mayor took to the airwaves in the midst of a newspaper strike to read the funny pages to children, throwing in some politics while he was at it: \"Say, children, what does it all mean? It means that dirty money never brings any luck!\" La Guardia said.",
      "\"A one-man melting pot\"",
      "Fiorello La Guardia was born in New York to Italian immigrants. His father was raised Catholic; his mother was Jewish. Fiorello himself became a practicing Episcopalian. \"La Guardia in some ways is the quintessential New Yorker, a one-man melting pot,\" Jackson said.",
      "But he actually grew up in the American West (his father was a band leader in the U.S. Army). By age 24, he was back in New York, working as an interpreter at Ellis Island while he attended law school.",
      "As mayor, La Guardia championed immigrants and the working class, while reshaping the city through massive public works. But he could never have pulled off his ambitious agenda without two allies: his visionary and polarizing parks commissioner, Robert Moses; and Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose New Deal bankrolled much of what was built. La Guardia was a Republican, but the two shared the same progressive ideals.",
      "Jackson said, \"Under La Guardia, we built our first public housing. That's an important thing, because for the first 300 years of American history, housing is your problem, not my problem, the government's. That's a huge governmental shift.\"",
      "I asked, \"Does La Guardia help redefine what a city should do for its citizens?\"",
      "Jackson replied, \"He's the most powerful public official, short of the president, to say, what higher obligation do we have than keeping our citizens alive? What higher obligation do we have than keeping them out of the cold in January? What higher obligation do we have than to feed their children when they're hungry?\"",
      "Patron of the arts",
      "Michael Rosenberg, the president and CEO of New York City Center, one of the city's premier and most beautiful theaters, said that without La Guardia, City Center would not exist: \"This would now be a parking lot.\"",
      "Originally built by the Shriners, the building was taken over by the city when the Shriners couldn't pay their taxes. La Guardia proposed turning it into a temple for music, dance and theater, for the average, everyday working man of New York City. Tickets on opening night were just $1, compared to $10 at the Metropolitan Opera.",
      "\"He also made the curtain times earlier,\" Rosenberg said. \"They would do curtain times at 5:00 o'clock.\" The schedule catered to the working classes, who would have to get up very early for work the next day.",
      "\"La Guardia's a great example of a mayor using the power and majesty of his office to support ideas that are important to him,\" Rosenberg said. \"And this is a great example. He believed in the arts. And he saw this as a way of bringing that belief to life.\"",
      "Jackson said, \"He was quite a person. And I think that not only did he deserve New York, but New York deserved him. They fit together. They needed each other. And by the grace of God, or whomever, it happened.\"",

      "The Trump administration\u00a0said\u00a0on Wednesday it is postponing tariff increases on imported upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities by a year, citing ongoing negotiations with trading partners.",
      "Without the delay, the U.S. was set to double its tariff rate on kitchen cabinets and vanities produced outside the U.S. to 50% starting Jan. 1. The import duty on upholstered furniture \u2014 including sofas and armchairs \u2014 was set to rise to 30% from 25% on the first day of 2026.",
      "The postponement follows a November rollback by the Trump administration of tariffs on imported foods such as beef, coffee and bananas, as affordability concerns\u00a0have weighed on consumer sentiment about the U.S. economy. Furniture prices have been outpacing inflation, with living room, kitchen and dining room furniture rising 4.6% in November from a year earlier, compared with a 2.7% annual increase in the overall Consumer Price Index.",
      "According to the Dec. 31 White House announcement, the tariff rate on upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets and vanities will remain at 25%.",
      "\"The United States continues to engage in productive negotiations with trade partners to address trade reciprocity and national security concerns with respect to imports of wood products,\" the White House said in its statement.",
      "\"The United States will therefore delay the increase in tariff rates for upholstered furniture, kitchen cabinets, and vanities that was set to take place on January 1, 2026, under the September 29, 2025, Proclamation for an additional year,\" it added.",
      "When President Trump announced the furniture tariffs in September, he wrote on social media that his goal was to help revive U.S. furniture manufacturing in North Carolina.

      "In a superseding indictment filed in the Southern District of New York against Maduro, members of his family and his cabinet, the U.S. is accusing the South American leader of conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import cocaine. He is also accused of possession of and conspiracy to possess \"Machineguns and Destructive Devices,\" according to the indictment unsealed Saturday by Attorney General Pam Bondi.",

      "Monday's arraignment starts the clock for prosecutors to turn over evidence against Maduro and those indicted, criminal defense attorney and CBS News Legal Analyst Caroline Polisi told \"CBS Evening News.\"",
      "\"There are lots of nuanced arguments to be made about where the trial goes domestically,\" Polisi said.",
      "Asked whether Maduro can get a fair trial in the U.S., Polisi said: \"The prosecution wants to make sure every element of this trial is above board, is not prejudicial, they just as much as the defense want this case to be fair and impartial.\"",
      "The charges appear to be the same as those that were filed in a 2020 indictment of Maduro and several key aides.",
      "The indictment, prepared by New York U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton, says: \"For over 25 years, leaders of Venezuela have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States,\" before alleging that Maduro \"is at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.\"",
      "The U.S. government also claimed that Flores is involved in her husband's alleged crimes. According to the indictment, Flores allegedly brokered a meeting between a large-scale drug trafficker and the director of Venezuela's National Anti-Drug Office, Nestor Reverol Torres, and allegedly accepted hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes in 2007.",
      "The trafficker arranged a bribe to Reverol Torres \u2014 $100,000 per flight \u2014 to ship cocaine, prosecutors allege. Reverol Torres was\u00a0indicted in 2015 by U.S. prosecutors in New York.",

      "His comments came a day after the U.S. military captured former Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife during an overnight raid in Caracas. This raised concern in Denmark that the same could happen in Greenland, a Danish territory.",

      "\"The U.S. has no right to annex any of the three nations in the Danish kingdom,\" she said, adding: \"I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people, who have very clearly said that they are not for sale.\"",

      "\"We are close allies and should continue to work together as such,\" Soerensen said of Denmark's relationship with the U.S. He added that both countries \"work together to ensure security in the Arctic\" and his \"significantly boosted its Arctic security efforts\" in 2025, an example of how it takes their \"joint security seriously.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's announcement Saturday that the United States will \"run\" Venezuela\u00a0after the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife is raising new questions about the extent of U.S. involvement in the South American country.",
      "Mr. Trump did not offer many details about his administration's plans for the U.S. role in Venezuela as he spoke about the overnight mission from his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. The president had announced on social media hours earlier that Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were \"captured and flown out of the country.\" Officials told CBS News that the operation was carried out by the U.S. Army's Delta Force, an elite special operations unit.",
      "Maduro and his wife were brought to the U.S. to face criminal charges stemming from what prosecutors have alleged is their participation in a conspiracy to commit narco-terrorism and to import \"thousands of tons\" of cocaine to the U.S. Maduro and his wife arrived at Stewart Airport just north of New York City on Saturday afternoon, hours after their capture.",
      "With Maduro's ouster, it's unclear who is in charge in Venezuela or could lead the nation in the future. Mr. Trump said it would be \"very tough\" for Venezuelan opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado to take over because she \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country.\"",
      "The president said Secretary of State Marco Rubio also had a conversation with Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who Mr. Trump said has been \"sworn in\" and is \"essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.\"",
      "But in remarks on state television, Rodriguez said Maduro is the \"only president of Venezuela\" and demanded his release. She was later granted full presidential power by the Venezuelan supreme court on Saturday and recognized by the military as the country's acting leader on Sunday.",
      "Venezuela held its last presidential election in July 2024, but election authorities did not provide detailed vote counts, and the U.S. and many European countries rejected Maduro's claim of victory. The U.S., under the Biden administration,\u00a0recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the president-elect. Gonz\u00e1lez fled into exile in Spain in September 2024 after a warrant was issued for his arrest.",
      "Trump says U.S. will \"run it properly,\" but provides few details",
      "Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"going to run the country\" until there is a \"safe, proper and judicious transition\" in power in Venezuela.",
      "\"We can't take a chance that somebody else takes over Venezuela that doesn't have the good of the Venezuelan people in mind. We've had decades of that. We're not going to let that happen,\" the president said. \"We're there now. And what people don't understand, but they understand as I say this, we're there now, but we're going to stay until such time as the proper transition can take place.\"",
      "He did not provide any additional details about how the U.S. would oversee Venezuela, under what authority, or whether the U.S. would play a role in picking a new leader.",
      "Mr. Trump did indicate that top administration officials \u2014 including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who appeared alongside Mr. Trump on Saturday \u2014 would work with a \"team\" working with the Venezuelan people. He did not, however, say who would be included in that group.",
      "In an interview Saturday evening, \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth what that may look like.",
      "\"It means we set the terms. President Trump sets the terms. And ultimately, he'll decide what the iterations are of that,\" Hegseth said. \"But, it means the drugs stop flowing, it means the oil that was taken from us is returned, ultimately, and that criminals are not sent to the United States.\"",
      "Role of the oil industry",
      "When asked about a timeframe for U.S. involvement, Mr. Trump said Venezuela's \"whole infrastructure\" has to be rebuilt. He focused in particular on the prospect of rebuilding the oil industry in a nation with one of the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "\"If we just left, it [Venezuela] has zero chance of ever coming back,\" he said. \"We'll run it properly. We'll run it professionally. We'll have the greatest oil companies in the world going in and invest billions and billions of dollars and take out money, use that money in Venezuela, and the biggest beneficiary is going to be the people of Venezuela.\"",
      "When asked about the\u00a0blockade of sanctioned oil\u00a0from Venezuela imposed by Mr. Trump last month, Hegseth said no oil is going in or out of the country, and the U.S. military is still poised in the Caribbean.",
      "\"[Mr. Trump] said it clearly at the podium today. We are going to get American companies in there. We are going to get investment in there. These oil depots have been operating at 20% capacity. That's going to change,\" Hegseth told CBS News.",
      "Maduro regime figures remain in place",
      "While the Trump administration has removed Maduro, top members of his government remain in place. Among them are Rodr\u00edguez, who Maduro selected as his vice president, as well as Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino and Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.",
      "Cabello is named as a defendant alongside Maduro and his wife in the superseding indictment returned by a federal grand jury in New York as allegedly part of the narco-terrorism conspiracy.",
      "Seemingly in a warning to Venezuelan officials who remain in place, Mr. Trump said the U.S. is \"ready to stage a second and much larger attack\" in Venezuela if needed, and that his administration is \"not afraid of boots on the ground.\"",
      "Rubio expanded on the comment on Sunday\u00a0on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" saying that Mr. Trump \"does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now.\"",
      "Asked to clarify that there is no plan for U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio said \"the president always retains optionality on anything and on all of these matters.\"",
      "When asked about other indicted members of Maduro's Cabinet, Rubio responded, \"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\"",
      "\"The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted,\" Rubio said, calling Maduro the \"top target.\"",
      "Asked whether the U.S. is working on a transition to install the leader, Rubio said, while he has \"admiration for Edmundo\" and opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",

      "Crans-Montana, Switzerland \u2014 A Mass was held Sunday for victims of the New Year's Eve fire at a bar in the Swiss Alpine resort of Crans-Montana that left 40 dead and many severely injured, as distressed parents waited for news of their children or began the long process of mourning.",
      "By Sunday evening, Swiss authorities had identified all of the 40 fatalities. The dead include 18 Swiss citizens aged 14 to 31 years, two Italians aged 16, one dual citizen of Italy and the United Arab Emirates, also 16 years old, an 18-year-old Romanian, a 39-year-old French and a Turkish citizen, 18.",
      "In addition to the 40 who died, 119 were injured in the blaze that broke out around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday at Le Constellation bar. Police have said many of the victims were in their teens to mid-20s.",
      "Gray-haired parents, teenagers and members of the police were seen comforting one another during the service, which took place at the Chapelle Saint-Christophe in Crans-Montana. Mass was followed by a silent march to the site of the tragedy.",
      "In the crowded pews, a grieving woman listened intently, her hands clasped tightly and sometimes clasping rosary beads, as speakers delivered readings in German, French and Italian. Despite freezing weather, several hundred followed the Mass on the screen installed outside the church.",
      "The Rev. Gilles Cavin spoke of the \"terrible uncertainty\" for families unsure if their loved ones are among the dead or still alive, among the injured. \"We pray for their friends hard hit by misery on this day that was meant to be one of festivities and friendship,\" he said.",
      "One of the victims was 16-year old Arthur Brodard, whose mother had been frantically searching for him.",
      "\"Our Arthur has now left to party in paradise,\" a visibly shaken Laetitia Brodard said in a Facebook story posted on Saturday night, speaking to the camera. \"We can start our mourning, knowing that he is in peace and in the light.\"",
      "Brodard's frenzied search for her son reflected the desperation of families of the young people disappeared during the fire, who didn't know whether their loved ones were dead or in the hospital.",
      "Swiss authorities said the process of identifying victims was particularly hard because of the advanced degree of the burns, requiring the use of DNA samples. Brodard also had given her DNA sample to help in the identification process.",
      "In her Facebook post, Brodard thanked those who \"testified their compassion, their love\" and to those who shared information as she anxiously searched and waited for news of her son.",
      "Other parents and siblings are still waiting in anguish.",
      "Swiss authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the bar's managers. In a statement on Sunday, regional police said there were no legal grounds so far that would require the managers to be held pending the legal process. They have not been deemed to be a flight risk.",
      "The two are suspected of involuntary homicide, involuntary bodily harm and involuntarily causing a fire, the Valais region's chief prosecutor, Beatrice Pilloud, told reporters Saturday. The announcement of the investigation didn't name the managers.",
      "Investigators had said they believe sparkling candles atop Champagne bottles ignited the fire when they came too close to the ceiling of the crowded bar.",
      "\"Initial witness accounts cited a fire that spread quickly, generating a lot of smoke and a huge wave of heat,\" the police statement Sunday said. \"Everything happened very fast.\"\u00a0 Authorities planned to look into whether sound-dampening material on the ceiling conformed with regulations and whether the candles were permitted for use in the bar. Officials said they also would look at other safety measures on the premises, including fire extinguishers and escape routes.",
      "Swiss President Guy Parmelin announced a national day of mourning for the victims on Jan. 9.",
      "France's Health Minister St\u00e9phanie Rist said 17 patients have received care in France, out of a total of 35 transferred from Switzerland to five European countries. Other patients were planned to be transferred to Germany, Italy and Belgium.",

    "summary": "The gunmen stormed the Kasuwan-Daji village in Niger state's Borgu local government area on Saturday evening and opened fire on residents.",
    "story": [
      "At least 30 villagers have been killed while several others were abducted by gunmen who raided a village in northern\u00a0Nigeria's\u00a0Niger state, police said Sunday, the latest in a cycle of deadly violence in the conflict-hit region.",
      "The gunmen stormed the Kasuwan-Daji village in Niger state's Borgu local government area on Saturday evening and opened fire on residents. They also razed down the local market and several houses, Niger state police spokesman Wasiu Abiodun said in a statement.",
      "At least two residents put the death toll at 37 and said it could be much higher, as some people remained missing as of Sunday. Residents also said security forces are yet to arrive in the area, contradicting the police's claim that they have deployed officers to search for those kidnapped.",
      "Rev. Fr. Stephen Kabirat, spokesman for the Catholic Church of Kontagora Diocese, where the attack happened, told local media that the gunmen killed more than 40 people and that some of those abducted were children.",
      "The gunmen had been lurking around nearby communities for about a week before the attack, according to a resident who asked not to be named for fear of his safety. Now, survivors are too afraid to go recover the bodies.",
      "\"The bodies are there (in Kasuwan-Daji village). If we don't see any security, how can we go there?\" the resident said, adding that the attack lasted for up to three hours.",
      "Such attacks are common in Nigeria,\u00a0Africa's most populous country, where dozens of rogue gangs seeking control often target remote communities with limited security and government presence.",
      "Saturday's attack in Kasuwan-Daji village happened near the Papiri community, where more than 300 schoolchildren and their teachers\u00a0were kidnapped from a Catholic school\u00a0in November.",
      "The attackers who raided Kasuwan-Daji arrived from the National Park Forest along Kabe district, according to the police, pointing to a usual trend where abandoned expansive forest reserves act as hideouts for armed gangs.",

      "Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were seized during an overnight U.S. raid on their home in Caracas after it had conducted airstrikes in Venezuela in support of what the administration says was a law enforcement operation to enforce an indictment charging him with narco-terrorism. They arrived in the U.S. on Saturday night, and Maduro was transported to the\u00a0Metropolitan Detention Center, a federal facility in Brooklyn.",
      "Mr. Trump said Saturday that Maduro's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, had been sworn in to replace him. Many from Maduro's regime who have alleged ties to narco-terrorists as well as U.S. adversaries remain in power in Venezuela, and\u00a0Mr. Trump said Saturday\u00a0that opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado \"doesn't have the support within or the respect within the country\" to lead.",

      "\"So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?\" Rubio said, adding that Maduro was the \"top target.\"",
      "\"But we're not just addressing the regime,\" Rubio said. \"We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.\"",
      "Although Rubio \u2014 like the Biden administration\u00a0\u2014 has recognized Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez as the winner of the 2024 election, Rubio did not answer whether he believes Gonz\u00e1lez should be the leader of the country. Rubio instead said, \"There's the mission we are on right now.\"",
      "Cotton on Sunday reiterated some of Rubio's points about what the Trump administration wants to see in Venezuela's government, which is still composed of Maduro's allies.",
      "\"We want them to stop the drug and weapons trafficking,\" Cotton said. \"We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals like Hezbollah and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela but in our backyard.\"",
      "Cotton said he felt that new elections \"should be a goal,\" and he said he hoped the government in place would allow the return of political exiles such as Machado, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in October.",
      "\"In some period of time \u2014 it probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months \u2014 that you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair,\" Cotton said.",

      "Rodriguez left open the door for dialogue with the U.S., while seeking to calm ruling party supporters.",
      "\"Here, we have a government with clarity, and I repeat and repeat again \u2026 we are willing to have respectful relations,\" she said, referring to the Trump administration. \"It is the only thing we will accept for a type of relationship after having attacked (Venezuela).\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Rep. Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Connecticut Congressman Jim Himes. He is the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, and he joins us this morning from Greenwich. Congressman Himes, you are part of that \"Gang of Eight,\" which means that information about these secret operations is statutorily intended to be shared with you as part of this very small group, given that and what you should know, can you clearly explain what the United States is doing?",
      "REP. JIM HIMES: Yeah, by the way, I was delighted to hear that Tom Cotton, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has been in regular contact with the administration. I've had zero outreach. And no Democrat that I'm aware of has had any outreach whatsoever. So apparently, we're now in a world where the legal obligation to keep the Congress informed only applies to, to your party, which is really something. But yeah, no, look, I know exactly where we are, Margaret. We're in the euphoria period of acknowledging across the board that Maduro was a bad guy and that our military is absolutely incredible. This is exactly the euphoria we felt in 2002 when our military took down the Taliban in Afghanistan. In 2003 when our military took out Saddam Hussein, and in 2011 when we helped remove Muammar Gaddafi from power in Libya. These were very, very bad people, by the way, much, much worse than Maduro in Venezuela, which was never a significant national security threat to the United States. But we're in that euphoria phase, and what we learned the day after the euphoria phase is that it's an awful lot easier to break a country than it is to actually do what the president promised to do, which is to run it. And so again, let's, let- let's let my Republican colleagues enjoy their day of euphoria, but they're going to wake up tomorrow morning, knowing, oh my God, there is no plan here any more than there was in Afghanistan, Iraq or in Libya.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you heard the secretary of state say, well, this is not the Middle East. There are conflicting statements from cabinet members. Hegseth told CBS, you know, the president of the United States will absolutely be in charge here, and leaned into the idea of military options. President Trump said there will be an option of boots on the ground. Secretary Rubio, though, really just leaned into an oil quarantine here. What- what exactly is the point of leverage here? When do you expect to get answers? Do your Republican colleagues promise you that they will get some of these answers to the questions you have?",
      "REP. HIMES: Of course, not Margaret. I mean, look, you're seeing it on television today, right? Two thirds of my Republicans [audio gap] wake up every single morning, and the only question they have is, what can I do to prove my loyalty to the president today? And we see this because the president has completely shifted who he was. I mean, as I watched that news conference yesterday, I thought, oh my god, this is Dick Cheney and the neocons. Not only are they taking out a- they're doing a regime change in a country, by the way, not a Tier 1 threat to the United States, but that they just don't like. They're warning the other dictators. This is Dick Cheney in 2002 saying we're taking down Saddam Hussein and, by the way, Syria and Iran better watch out. And the fascinating thing about that, and why it's really hard to answer the question of where the hell they're going to go from here, is that the president won by promising MAGA and his own people that this kind of stuff was done, that the neocons were over, and here we are. That was Dick Cheney in the conference yesterday, you know, deciding that the United States was going to, you know, militarily change regimes and threaten other ones, just because we don't like them.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, but then the secretary of state was talking about working with the regime and working with Maduro's number two, who is now running the place, and other indicted criminals, according to the Southern District of New York who are continuing to run Venezuela. So can you really say that's regime change if they're working with the regime?",
      "REP. HIMES: As you pointed out, it's [audio gap] right and [audio gap] a loss to explain any consistency here. I mean, as you pointed out Maduro was a very bad guy and indicted Trump. Weeks ago, the pardoned bad and indicted [audio gap]. Weeks ago [audio gap] pardoned [audio gap] indicted drug-\u00a0 [audio gap]. These guys get a pardon [audio gap] full [audio gap] them [audio] New York. I [audio gap] that. There is no law [audio gap] maybe, maybe [audio gap] believes that [audio gap] work with the [audio gap] but, I mean, look again, go back [audio gap]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman Himes, I'm sorry to cut you off here. I'm having a terrible time, audio-wise. I'm going to take a break because hopefully our technicians can fix it in those two minutes. So please stay with us. We'll be right back.",
      "[COMMERCIAL BREAK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Back to our conversation with Connecticut Democratic Congressman Jim Himes, who I think can be heard now. Congressman, I'm glad we got the link back up. For those viewers who lost you there, can you explain to us? The administration is arguing that what they did is legal, and that the snatch and grab operation of taking an indicted criminal, Nicolas Maduro, to the United States through military force has precedent, and they point back to what happened in the late 80s with Noriega in Panama. What's your challenge to that?",
      "REP. HIMES: Yeah, well, first, it's clearly illegal under international law, right? No full stop, UN Charter. No question there. Now you may not care about international law, but if you don't care about international law, remember, you're going to be making an appeal to international law to try to get restitution for the seizure of Chevron's oil stuff. So maybe you want to rethink how much disdain you show for international law. Clearly, not legal under the Constitution because though Presidents of both parties have argued against this, the Constitution is really pretty clear that the representatives of the people get to be consulted and ultimately approve military activity. That has not happened here at all. And, so again, there's nothing legal about this. And, more to the point, again, under the international law point, think of what Russia and China just learned. Russia and China just learned that all you need to do if you want to go into Estonia is to say that the leader of Estonia is a bad person. You don't even need to make a particularly good case. Look, there's no national security expert saying that Venezuela was a mortal threat to the United States three weeks ago. So what China and Russia just learned is that the beacon of liberty and rule of law in the world has now green lighted snatch and grab operations in Estonia, in Taiwan, wherever Xi and Putin decide they want to go next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So I take your point on the precedent there. Do you think that China or Russia would have the ability to carry out that kind of lightning operation the United States did?",
      "REP. HIMES: Well, no, but that doesn't mean, well, China, yes. China, yes. China, very soon. And you know, their leader has said, we will develop this capability. We know that their intent is to do precisely this in Taiwan. Russia is a more complicated case. It's, you know, Russia loses 10,000 people to get in, you know, three acres of land in eastern Ukraine. But that may not be true five years from now, and by the way, back to the Noriega case. Because you do ask a good question there, Panama is a terrible precedent. Why do I say that? Because when we went into Panama, the Panamanian Congress had declared war on the United States of America, right? They had killed a United States Marine and wounded two others, and the Congress had been consultant. The Congress in the Noriega mission had, had authorized regime change. So it's a terrible precedent that the administration is using to say that this is legal.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, as we understand it, because we looked this up, Noriega claimed head of state immunity, and the court said that that immunity was meant to protect official state functions and private profiting off the drug trade. Basically, the courts ruled on his actions as a leader and not on the legality of the snatch-and-grab operation itself. So we're going to continue to track all of this. Thank you Congressman Himes, thank you Senator Van Hollen. We will be right back.",

Does the US still assess that the regime in Venezuela is made up of Narco terrorists with ties to Iran, Russia, China and Cuba?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, first off, let me commend not only our military; as President Trump said this was an excellent operation, only the United States military could have pulled it off, but they couldn't have pulled it off with the support -- without the support of the professionals in the intelligence community, especially at the Central Intelligence Agency, and I'm glad that we have a director, John Ratcliffe, that has restored confidence in the CIA and the president - the president has, I think the President respects the CIA as much as he ever has. It's a great day, not just for our military, for our CIA. There's no question that the people in Venezuela who are still in charge of the apparatus of the government are sanctioned and indicted officials, and they've been in league with Nicolas Maduro until just yesterday. I think President Trump wants to give them a chance to turn a new page. Now, that's happened in the past. If you look at what's happened in Syria, as you know, Ahmed al-Sharaa, used to be an Islamic terrorist. He's now effectively a pro-American leader of Syria. Muammar Gaddafi, the same way, had much blood on his hands after the Iraq War, he turned over a new page and came out of the cold. Now, the difference in those two cases is they made concrete concessions to the United States and our policy goals and interests, or they had a longer history of turning the corner like Ahmed al-Sharaa has--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:-- Or it's an entirely new government.",
      "SEN. COTTON: We've got, we've got to make sure that the people who are now in charge of the apparatus of the Venezuelan Government are not going to continue Nicholas Maduro's ways, and I think that's what the President made clear yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it sounds like you think that's actually possible? For these individuals to cut all ties to the cartels?",
      "SEN. COTTON: The president, the president wants to give them a chance to turn the page in Venezuela and to help America achieve our policy goals there.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: How much time would you allow for that?",
      "SEN. COTTON: I wouldn't allow much personally, but I know those conversations are ongoing. As Secretary Rubio said earlier on the show in your interview, we want them to stop the drug and the weapons trafficking. We want them to take the refugees back. We want them to kick out the Iranians, the Cubans, the Islamic radicals, like Hezbollah, and just return to being a normal nation that will help build stability, order and prosperity, not just in Venezuela, but in our backyard.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Should a free and democratic Venezuela still be a goal of the United States of America? And if so, do you hear from the administration a plan to transition to that?",
      "SEN. COTTON:I think it should--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because Secretary Rubio wasn't--",
      "SEN. COTTON: I think it should be a goal. The opposition leaders, Miss Machado, Mr. Gonzalez, have said they think there need to be new elections. I hope the government that's right now in place in Venezuela will allow them to return, along with many other exiles who have left, political exiles who have left Venezuela, and that in some period of time, probably is not going to be days or weeks, maybe a number of months, you can have new elections in Venezuela that are free and fair. The Venezuelan people have made clear now under Nicholas Maduro, that they do not want a Chavista regime governing them. They want to say in their own future, Venezuela has a long history of stable, orderly government that was friendly to the United States. We are their number one customer for oil, and we work together to help build prosper- prosperity and stability in our own backyard. I hope that we can do that again with the future government of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The CIA -- or CBS is reporting that the CIA source inside the Venezuelan government helped the US track Maduro's location leading up to this capture by the Army's Delta Force. The president said yesterday, the US should not pay out that $50 million bounty that was on the head of Maduro. Does that mean that the CIA asset inside still works for us?",
      "SEN. COTTON: Well, I have no comment on CIA sources or methods in Venezuela or elsewhere--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But they won't be receiving the $50 million reward?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: I'll simply say that the CIA's amazing work here, that has instilled such confidence in the president, is a reminder not just to Nicolas Maduro's cronies in Venezuela, but other bad guys all around the world, that we have very good insights into what they're doing and what they're up to.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So when the President says we will run Venezuela, you are confident that there are actual American assets helping to do that. Is that how I should --",
      "SEN. COTTON: I'm confident that we have very good insight into Venezuela and other adversaries, foreign nations, and terrorist groups around the world. That's why--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Why was China there?",
      "SEN. COTTON: -- the President-- that's why the President has such confidence in John Ratcliffe and the CIA. Well, China was trying to provide support to Venezuela during a US pressure campaign. But where were they when Delta Force went in and got Nicola Maduro? They were nowhere to be found. And frankly, that's the same thing you saw in June with China and Russia in Iran. We struck Iran. China and Russia did nothing. They stood idly by. That's a reminder that the United States is still the world's dominant superpower. Our friends are very happy today. Our enemies are very worried.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But the person running the country, Delsey Rodriguez, spoke yesterday with Russia's top diplomat. They are in contact with Russia. The defense minister has deep, deep ties to Russia. Is there a US, Russia agreement here? Because there has been speculation based on testimony to Congress back in 2019 by one of Trump's top Russia advisers, Fiona Hill, that Russia has been floating a Venezuela for Ukraine deal here-",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: -for some time. Is there any such deal?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, this was a US operation that was designed to remove Nicholas Maduro because he was a US indicted drug trafficker, and you don't get immunity from American justice when you're indicted by our courts, just because you're the illegitimate communist dictator of another country. And--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But to be clear, that's not what I'm saying here. Is there an implication that if Russia doesn't meddle in America's backyard, South America, the United States, will do something less in Ukraine--",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --which Russia calls its backyard?",
      "SEN. COTTON: No, there's no such implication. And obviously, Russia doesn't need any kind of pretext to do so. It's invaded Ukraine twice over the last eleven years. There's no such implication here at all. And this is an operation the United States conducted on our own, without any coordination or cooperation from other countries to advance our national interest, which is to stop the drug trafficking and stop Venezuela from cooperating with countries like Russia and China and Cuba and Iran.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, I want to ask you about authorities here on the other side of the commercial break that we are going to take. So let me do that and come back. All right, stay with us. Senator Tom Cotton.",
      "***COMMERCIAL***",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 We return now to our conversation with Senate Intelligence chairman Tom Cotton, Senator Cotton, the president said Saturday that a second wave military attack had been planned. It wasn't necessary, but it could still be carried out. What would necessitate it? And what would you support?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 Well, what I took the president to mean is that what we just did with Nicholas Maduro could be done again to other Venezuelan leaders. Several of them are indicted in US courts. They're sanctioned by the United States and Canada and European Union and other nations. And if they continue down the path that Maduro took, the took the nation of Venezuela, then we could conduct the same kind of operation as him. I took that as the president, urging them to change their ways or face the same consequences.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN And would you support a stabilization force-- US boots on the ground, as the President said he wouldn't rule out?",
      "SEN. COTTON\u00a0 We already had boots on the ground, as Nicholas Maduro learned the hard way, it's always the President's option to use the American military to protect American citizens and interests. And obviously, we have many American citizens inside of Venezuela, and we have many interests and property as well. I think the president--",
      "MARGARET\u00a0 BRENNAN: But you know that combat and stabilization forces are--",
      "SEN. COTTON: But I don't think he- I don't think he plans to do that. And I think we've seen too the presiden-\u00a0 the President's way of war over the last or over five years in office. If you look at four major operations, the killing of the ISIS leader in Syria, the drone strike against the Iranian terrorist mastermind in Iraq, the strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. And now this capture of Nicolas Maduro, when our vital national interests are implicated, the President takes bold, audacious direct action. He accomplishes the mission, and then the mission is over. In some ways, this is the greatest mission of them all. I mean, as impressive as our military was in Iran in June or in its first term in Iraq and Syria against those terrorist masterminds, it's probably harder--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.",
      "SEN. COTTON: --to capture someone and get out with no American loss of life than it is to kill a target or to blow up nuclear facilities.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are drawing a distinction there in terms of authorities and use of the military. The War Powers Act requires the president to notify Congress of the reason for committing troops within 48 hours of their deployment, and requires they be removed within 60 to 90 days, unless Congress authorizes it. You okay with this open ended commitment to keep forces as they are?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON",
      "Well, I think he has removed the troops. They were only there for a couple hours to nab Nicolas--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the Delta Force operators who are on the ground.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But there is a significant military buildup all around South America right now.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yes.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're comfortable with that? Does Congress need any authority--",
      "**CROSSTALK**",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: No, I strongly support it. I mean, part of, part of that, that deployment, was to collect intelligence to conduct this operation to quarantine the oil trade that Venezuela was sending to Cuba or sending to our adversaries around the world.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's not mission accomplished?",
      "SEN. COTTON: It won't- we won't have accomplished our mission until Venezuela starts acting like a normal nation. It stops the drug trafficking and human trafficking, it kicks out Islamic radicals and Iranians and Cubans and helps the United States build a more stable, prosperous Western Hemisphere. That's the ultimate goal, and that's what President Trump laid out yesterday.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 So last month, the Chief of Staff to the president, Susie Wiles, told Vanity Fair that attacking targets on Venezuela's mainland, sovereign territory, would force Trump to get congressional approval. Quote, If he were to authorize some activity on land, then it's war, then we'd need Congress. You are a coequal branch of government. Why doesn't the President need you or your authority or your consultation?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON: Well, I consult routinely with the President and his senior advisors.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You, personally, sure. But",
      "SEN. COTTON: Yeah. Well, as the Chairman of the intelligence committee--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But as Congress--",
      "SEN. COTTON: As the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, they keep me apprised of what their plans are and what's going on. I mean, I spoke in the last 24 hours, not just with the President, but with his senior team, every man that was on that stage with him yesterday, Marco Rubio, John Ratcliffe, Pete Hegseth, Dan Caine, Stephen Miller. The core architect of the President's policy here, I've spoken with every single one of them in the last 24 hours. Congress has acted to provide the President the resources and authority that he needs to protect the vital interests of the United States, whether it's taking out this drug trafficker Nicolas Maduro who had contributed to the deaths of hundreds of Arkansans and hundreds of thousands of Americans, or striking Iran's nuclear facilities, he has the inherent authority under our constitution to protect these American national interests and as the chief law enforcement officer to make sure that indicted drug traffickers face justice, whether they're indicted in Venezuela or indicted in the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But by his own admission, the DEA administrator said that cocaine prices have gone up nearly 45% drug traffickers have only changed routes. Venezuela is not a fentanyl producer, not a cocaine producer. Do you really think that this has ended the drug problem?",
      "SEN. TOM COTTON \u00a0 Venezuela is unique in Latin America, though, because the Maduro regime is itself in league with the drug trafficking cartels. It doesn't just tolerate them, or it doesn't just fail to control its territory. It is in league and profits from drug trafficking cartels. That's the distinction between Venezuela and other nations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN\u00a0 Senator Cotton, thank you for your time today.",
      "SEN. COTTON: Thank you, Margaret.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Jan. 4, 2026.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face The Nation. I just want to apologize to our viewers there. Congressman Himes did not have a bad case of the hiccups. We have technical problems. That's why he was getting interrupted there. It's called LiveU, that's the technology being used, and it wasn't working. So apologies for cutting that short. You're back with me now in studio, and we're going to talk to Maryland Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, who is here in-person\u2013",
      "SEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN: Good to be with you Margaret.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013and will not have those problems, we hope. But let's pick up on that very same point that we were discussing with Congressman Himes there. He says that no information was being shared with the top people who have oversight, like himself. What leverage do Democrats have to force the administration to treat Congress as a co-equal branch of government?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, Margaret, it's hard when the Republicans in Congress are totally AWOL, right? When they want to give Donald Trump essentially a blank check, because they continue to have majorities, of course, in the House and the Senate. Obviously in 2026 if Democrats regain control of either house, we will have the gavel, but in the meantime, we need to go directly to the American people and just make it very clear that in this case, it's my view that the Trump administration has been lying to the American people. This has never been about stopping drugs from coming to the United States. We all support stopping drugs. This, from the beginning, has been about getting rid of Maduro, grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies and Trump's billionaire buddies. That's what this is about. That's why Donald Trump spent so much time yesterday talking about oil.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 20 times the word oil was used in those remarks. The Defense Secretary spoke to my colleague Tony Dokoupil and used the word oil about six times. There is a lot of focus on those natural resources, but arguably, isn't that what China, Russia, Iran, others, are also trying to do? Which is to extract their own benefit from this country. You know, What is the counter to that point that the administration would argue?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the counter is, you don't invade a country to grab their natural resources, right?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you consider this an invasion, even though, although it's unclear, because\u2013",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, let's put it this way\u2013",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013Senator Cotton both said there were boots on the ground and that there aren't.",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, they took- they had boots on the ground, right? They took, they took out the leader, and now they're demanding access to Venezuela's oil. That's what this has been about. I mean, Donald Trump, you know, claimed that he'd been against the war in Iraq from the beginning. That wasn't true, but what we do know is he said, well, having gone into Iraq, we should have gotten their oil. This is what drives Donald Trump and our service men and women perform magnificently, but I think it's outrageous that the President of the United States puts American lives at risk so big American oil companies and his billionaire buddies can profit.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But arguably, there are also critical minerals there. There are all sorts of natural resources in Venezuela that the drug cartels even were getting in the business of, that the Chinese were there trying to get. How do you do both things? Both corner the market on things that are of vital national security interest, those kind of minerals, and still actually maintain the principles that you're arguing should be upheld?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, the United States is working, and under the previous administration, also worked to secure critical mineral supply chains. Unfortunately, in many of these areas, the Trump administration actually has surrendered to China. I mean, if you look at, for example, clean energy and all those issues and batteries, we've essentially surrendered that market to China. What you don't do Margaret is you don't put American lives at risk to go in and grab oil resources to benefit the billionaires that support Donald Trump.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So Chevron, an American Oil Company, has been operating in Venezuela throughout and they told CBS yesterday that they continue to work there. My understanding is there are hundreds of Americans working and living in Venezuela still. Reportedly, there are at least four who have been detained by the regime, the regime that remains in power. You are on Senate Foreign Relations, what do you know about the detained Americans? What can you find out about how they're doing?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: I've not gotten an update from the administration on those detained Americans. Months ago, I did work to secure the release of an American, a Marylander, who we now have back in Baltimore, Maryland. I think the administration is looking at those detentions currently ongoing in Venezuela and determining how many of them are wrongful detentions, how many that they don't think are wrongful detentions. But certainly, my view is we should work to bring back every American who is wrongfully detained overseas. I think this is going to complicate that effort, what the Trump administration just did.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Because they could designate Venezuela as a state sponsor of hostage taking? Is that where you're going with that?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, my view is that the administration should designate as wrongfully detained any Americans that the Venezuelan Government has seized wrongfully. And then there are ways to continue to put pressure on. Now, normally, that pressure would be through sanctions. Here, the administration obviously has taken military action. As you've been pointing out, we're still left with the regime. I mean, the Vice President is part of the regime. Donald Trump says he's running Venezuela. This is not going to end well. Iraq did not end well. Other efforts to try to get rid of bad people, and we're glad to get rid of Maduro. I'd like to get rid of leaders in other countries, but you don't do it through force. That just doesn't work out well in our experience.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right and even on that point, the Secretary of State Rubio challenged me in saying, oh, we couldn't grab all those people at once, but Attorney General- former Attorney General Bill Barr was on Fox News this morning, the man who put together that first indictment of Maduro, and he said the intention was to clean the place out of this criminal organization, so there's going to have to be follow up action. To be clear, do you oppose all Snatch and Grab operations of indicted people?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I don't think we should be putting American men and women at risk in a situation like this. I mean, I'd have to look at every situation, but again, the motivation here is about grabbing Venezuela's oil for American oil companies. You already see folks on Wall Street lining up, so let's just be real as to what is really behind this operation. I mean, Donald Trump said he was going to focus on the United States. We have people's health care costs going through the roof because they refuse to extend the Affordable Care tax credits. Meanwhile, he bails out Argentina and wants to run Venezuela for the benefit of American oil companies.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to have to talk about all the things you just raised as we- in a future episode of Face the Nation. But clearly on the question of war powers, does the President have the legal authority to do what he's doing?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: No, he does not. I mean, this is\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're on the Appropriations Committee. You've got power. What can you do about it?",
      "SEN. VAN HOLLEN: Well, I worked with Senator Merkley already to offer a resolution in the United States Senate to cut off any U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund an attack against Venezuela. Republicans blocked us from doing it. So yes, we will continue to push. In fact, I'm sure we're going to have a vote on a war powers resolution, probably as early as this week, if not next. Last time we offered those Margaret, Republicans voted no, all, but one or two. Senator Paul voted with us, maybe one other. But for the most part, Republicans are happy to give Donald Trump a blank check and surrender their constitutional responsibilities to Donald Trump,",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Van Hollen. A lot more to talk to you about. Thank you very much for joining us here today.",

      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We begin today with Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, who joins us this morning from Miami. Good morning to you, Mr. Secretary.",
      "SECRETARY OF STATE MARCO RUBIO: Good morning. Good morning.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN:\u00a0 President Trump said that the United States will run the country and that Venezuela will be largely run by, he pointed to you and some of the other cabinet members when he spoke to the public yesterday. He said, The U.S. retains all military options, including boots on the ground until U.S. demands have been fully met. How do you plan to run the country?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, first of all, I think the important thing to point out is that the key to what that regime relies on and is the economy fueled by oil. And right now, it is an oil industry that is backwards and really needs a lot of help and work in terms of, not only that, but it doesn't help the people. None of the money from the oil gets to the people. It's all stolen by the people that are on the top there, and so that's why we have a quarantine. There's a quarantine right now in which sanctioned oil shipments, there's a boat, and that boat is under US sanctions, we go get a court order, we will seize it. That remains in place, and that's a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela. And so that's the sort of control the President is pointing to when he says that. We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking, so that we no longer have these gang problems, so that they kick the FARC and the ELN out, and that they no longer cozy up to Hezbollah and Iran in our own hemisphere.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: What you are talking about is more of a sanctions pressure, not boots on the ground. So just to be clear, there is no plan for U.S. occupation of this country of nearly 30 million people?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think first of all, the President always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters. He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country. That said, and all of that said as right now, I think what you see as a force posture is one of the largest naval deployments in modern history, certainly in the Western Hemisphere, and it is capable of stopping not just drug boats, but stopping any of these sanctioned boats that come in and out, and really paralyzing that portion of how the regime, you know, generates revenue, so that will continue to be in place. What the President has said, obviously, is, you know, and I think what he's pointing to is that this obsession people have about boots and this or that. He,he does not feel like he is going to publicly, you know, rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that's not what you're seeing right now. What you're seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he also said the U.S. is ready to stage a second and much larger attack, if we need to do so. But I'm curious, because you just described the regime as still in place, essentially. I mean, I'm curious why the Trump administration decided to leave it intact and only arrest Nicolas Maduro and his wife, the person who controls the police, the chief thug, Diosdado Cabellos, he's the interior minister. He's been indicted by the United States. He was in that indictment the Administration released. He's a narco-terrorist. There's a $25 million price on his head. He's still in place. The defense minister, who has deep ties to Russia, $15 million price on his head. He is still in place. I'm confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn't you arrest them if you are taking out the narco terrorist regime?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: You're confused? I don't know why that's confusing to you--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --they're still in power.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I mean it's very simple. You're not going to go in and wrap up. You're going to go in and then grab up-- but yeah, but can't go in and suck up five people. They're already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people. We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife, who was also indicted. And that was a pretty sophisticated and frankly, complicated operation.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: It was.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country, the guy lived on a military base, land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets. That's not an easy mission. And you're asking me, why didn't we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that's absurd. I- I do think this is one of the most, you know, daring, you know, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success. And today, an indicted drug trafficker who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Who we don't recognize, the Biden administration didn't recognize, 60-something countries don't recognize, the European Union doesn't recognize, and many countries in Latin America don't recognize. He was a convicted- he was a indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested. His wife was arrested also--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right but the others--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --and they are now facing justice in the American system of courts--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: --The others who were also indicted are still in place. So that's the point of my questioning there. But you talked about not being the legitimate president--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --so you wanted us to land in five other military bases?",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, I'm asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. But to your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: He was- he was the guy was claiming to be the president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. Well, the opposition--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO:--He was the top target.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, the opposition leader Mar\u00eda Corina Machado and Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez won that 2024 election, by your own account. They were some of the first people you called when you were Secretary of State, you said, Edmundo Gonz\u00e1lez is the rightful president of Venezuela. Is that still the U.S. policy? And if so, are you working on a transition to have those elected leaders run the country?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, I think a couple things I have tremendous admiration for Mar\u00eda Corina Machado. I have admiration for Edmundo. We have all those views about what the election that happened the last time, and not only us, but many other countries around the world, there's that. And there's and then- but there's the mission we are on right now. We have been very clear from the beginning, because I still think that a lot of people analyze everything that happens in foreign policy through the lens of what happened from 2001 through you know 2015 or 16. The whole, you know, foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan. This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere. Within the Western Hemisphere, we have a country, potentially a very rich country, that has cozied itself up under the control of this regime. Has cozied up to Iran. Has cozied up to Hezbollah. Has cozied- has allowed narco-trafficking gangs to operate with impunity from their own territory, allows boats with drugs to traffic from their territory. And we are addressing that. And by the way, for eight, nine million people and the largest mass migration event in modern history have left that country since 2014--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but that regime is still in place--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --also having an impact on us, that is what we are addressing now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: When you spoke yesterday--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Well, again that- but we're not just addressing the regime. We are addressing the factors that are a threat to the national interest of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Understood you spoke with Delcy Rodr\u00edguez, who is now, according to President Trump, sworn in as the President, as the leader of Venezuela. Did she promise you that she is expelling all those American adversaries from Venezuelan territory? What exactly did she agree to do when she spoke to you?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: We we are going to- our objectives when it comes to how Venezuela impacts the national interest of the United States have not changed, and we want those addressed. We want drug trafficking to stop. We want no more gang members to come our way. We don't want to see the Iranian and, by the way, Cuban presence in the past. We want the oil industry in that country not to go to the benefit of pirates and adversaries of the United States, but for the benefit of the people. We want to see all of that happen. We insist on seeing that happen--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Did you she promise that?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: --and we are going to work to continue to see that happen- well, right now, the United- we are going to see what happens moving forward, let me just say that. I'm not obviously going to have these conversations in the media. These are delicate and complicated things that require mature statesmanship, and that's what we intend to do. But our goals remain the same. The difference is that the person who was in charge, even though not legitimately in the past was someone you could not work with. We just could not work with him. He is not a person that had ever kept any of the deals he made, broke every deal he ever made, made a fool out of the Biden administration on the deal they made with him, and we offered him, on multiple occasions, an opportunity to remove himself from the scene in a positive way. He chose not to do so- and now he's in New York--",
      "[CROSSTALK]",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But, his number two is now running the country- his number two is someone you can work with? And is that what you're implying here? And did she tell you that she will transition to democracy and the woman who won the election along with her partner there, Mar\u00eda Corina Machado.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: We are going to make- we are going to make our assessments of people. You're asking me to make an assessment. We're going to make assessment- we're going to make an assessment on the basis of what they do, not what they say publicly in the interim, not what you know some what they've done in the past in many cases, but what they do moving forward. So we're going to find out. You're asking me, why- do I know what decisions people are going to make? I don't. I do know this, that if they don't make the right decisions, the United States will retain multiple levers of leverage to ensure that our interests are protected, and that includes the oil quarantine that's in place, among other things. Well, so we but we are going to judge moving forward. We're going to judge everything by what they do, and we're going to see what they do.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, because yesterday, President Trump said Mar\u00eda Corina Machado doesn't have the support or respect within the country, and by your own admission, she walloped Nicolas Maduro in the last election. So it does sound like a decision was made, but--",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: She wasn't on the ballot in the last election.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, but her, her party was.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Edmundo was.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Yes.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: Correct. So it was an illegitimate election, and that's why he's not a legitimate president.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right, but is there an agreement to transition to democracy? It sounds like there's not.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I think what the president pointed out is the obvious. Well, I think what the point, but there has to be a little realism here. Okay, a transition to the market \u2014 They've had this regime. They've had this system of Chavismo in place for 15 or 16 years, and everyone's asking, why 24 hours after Nicolas Maduro was arrested, there isn't an election scheduled for tomorrow? That's absurd.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: No, no, I'm asking what you talked about.",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: These things take time. There's a process.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right. And you are \u2014",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: I'm not going to have, I'm not going to publicly get into details about any of those things, other than to tell you that our expectations remain the same, and we are going to judge whoever we're interacting with moving forward by whether or not those conditions are met. We want, of course, we want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But, obviously, we don't have the expectation that's going to happen in the next 15 hours. What we do have an expectation is that, that it move in that direction. We think it's in our national interest, and frankly, in the interest of people of Venezuela.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: The president used the word oil 20 times this press conference. You talked about these tremendous oil assets that Venezuela have, has. But the president's last envoy to Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, is publicly arguing that you know better than the policy you're backing. He said, quote, \"Venezuelan plutocrats, or US oil executives seem to be coming to Mar-a-Lago and whispering about how easy life would be if we just made a deal with the regime once Maduro was gone.\" Is that what happened here?",
      "SECRETARY RUBIO: No, that's not what happened here. What happened here is that we arrested a narco trafficker who's now going to stand trial in the United States for the crimes he's committed against our people for 15 years, and the person who helped him, of course, his wife, who was co-located with him, so she was arrested as well. That's what happened here. As far as oil, look, oil is critical, not just to fueling economies all over the world. It's critical to Venezuela's future. Their oil industry is completely destroyed. It's destroyed, all those oil fields that used to produce a lot and wealth for their country and their people. Those things are decrepit. They're bankrupt. They need to be reinvested in. It's obvious, you, they do not have the capability to bring up that industry again. They need investment from private companies who are only going to invest under certain guarantees and conditions. That has to go to the benefit of the Venezuelan people. Right now, all of that wealth is stolen. It's stolen, and it goes into the hands of oligarchs around the world and the oligarchs inside of Venezuela. A handful of people benefit from it. The people don't benefit from it. On top of that, it's very simple, okay, in the 21st Century, under the Trump administration, we are not going to have a country like Venezuela in our own hemisphere, in the sphere of control and the crossroads for Hezbollah, for Iran and for every other malign influence in the country, in the world. That's just not going to exist.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, would love to keep talking to you, but I'm told you are out of time. I have to leave it there.",
      "MARCO RUBIO: Thank you.",

    "story": [
      "North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward its eastern waters Sunday, according to South Korean officials. The launches took place just hours before South Korea's president left for China for talks expected to cover North Korea's nuclear program.",
      "South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement it detected several ballistic missile launches from North Korea's capital region around 7:50 a.m. It stated that the missiles flew approximately 560 miles and that South Korean and U.S. authorities were analyzing the details of the launches.",
      "The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces operating in that region, stated that there was no \"immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies.\"",
      "\"We are aware of the missile launches and are consulting closely with our allies and partners,\" the command said in a\u00a0statement. \"Based on current assessments, this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies. The United States remains committed to the defense of the U.S. homeland and our allies in the region.\"",
      "Meanwhile, South Korea's Defense Ministry noted the launches violated U.N. Security Council resolutions that ban any ballistic activities by North Korea. It urged North Korea to cease provocative actions immediately and respond to South Korea's push to restart talks and restore peace on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "Japanese Defense Minister Shinjiro Koizumi said that at least two missile launches by North Korea have been confirmed. \"They are a serious problem, threatening the peace and security of our nation, the region and the world,\" Koizumi told reporters.",
      "The launches were the latest weapons demonstration by North Korea in recent weeks. Experts say North Korea is aiming to show off or review its achievements in the defense sector ahead of its upcoming ruling party congress, the first of its kind in five years. Observers are watching the Workers Party congress to see whether North Korea will set a new policy on the U.S. and resume long-stalled talks between the two countries.",
      "North Korea has been focusing on testing activities to enlarge its nuclear arsenal since its leader Kim Jong Un's summitry with U.S. President Donald Trump fell apart in 2019. Kim has also boosted his diplomatic credentials by aligning with Russia over its war in Ukraine and tightening relations with China. Observers say Kim would believe his leverage has sharply increased to wrest concessions from Trump if they sit down for talks again.",
      "North Korea hasn't announced when it will hold the congress, but South Korea's spy service said it will likely occur in January or February.",
      "Sunday's launches also came hours before South Korean President Lee Jae Myung departed for China for a summit with President Xi Jinping. During the four-day trip, Lee's office said he would request China, North Korea's major ally and biggest trading partner, to take \"a constructive role\" in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula.",
      "South Korea and the U.S. have long asked China to exercise its influence on North Korea to persuade it to return to talks or give up its nuclear program. But there are questions on how big of a leverage China has on its socialist neighbor. China, together with Russia, has also repeatedly blocked the U.S. and others' attempts to toughen economic sanctions on North Korea in recent years.",
      "Later Sunday, South Korea convened an emergency national security council meeting to discuss the North Korean missile launches. The council reported details of the launches and unspecified South Korean steps to Lee, according to the presidential office.",
      "The launches followed Saturday's dramatic U.S. military operation that ousted Venezuelan leader Nicol\u00e1s Maduro from power and brought him to the U.S. to face narco-terrorism conspiracy charges. It represented America's most assertive action to achieve regime change in a country since the nation's 2003 invasion of Iraq.",
      "North Korea's Foreign Ministry on Sunday slammed the U.S. operation, saying it again shows \"the rogue and brutal nature of the U.S.\" A ministry statement said it denounces the U.S. act as \"the most serious form of encroachment of sovereignty.\"",
      "\"Kim Jong Un may feel vindicated about his efforts to build a nuclear deterrent, as he likely did after Trump's strikes on Iran,\" said Leif-Eric Easley, professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. \"However, leaders of hostile regimes will probably live with greater paranoia after seeing how quickly Maduro was extracted from his country to stand trial in the United States.\"",
      "The official Korean Central News Agency said Sunday Kim visited a weapons factory on Saturday to review multipurpose precision guided weapons produced there. KCNA cited Kim as ordering officials to expand the current production capacity by about 2.5 times.",
      "Last Sunday, North Korea test-fired what it called long-range strategic cruise missiles. On Dec. 25, North Korea released photos showing apparent progress in the construction of its first nuclear-powered submarine.",

    "published": "Sat, 03 Jan 2026 18:53:54 -0500",
    "summary": "President Trump said \"we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be\" after the surprise U.S. attack. Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil sector.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. strike on Venezuela\u00a0has renewed focus on the country's oil sector, which includes some of the richest crude reserves in the world.",
      "\"We're going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars, it will be paid for by the oil companies directly. And we're going to get the oil flowing the way it should be,\" President Trump said in a public address on Saturday following the attack, in which the U.S. captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife.",
      "Here's what to know about Venezuela's oil industry.",
      "How much oil does Venezuela produce?",
      "Venezuela, a member of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces relatively little crude compared with other leading oil-producing nations. The country produces roughly 1 million barrels of crude oil per day, less than 1% of global output, according to OPEC data.",
      "Venezuela's oil production topped 3 million barrels per day in the early 2000s, but it has fallen sharply in recent decades due to declining investment and the impact of U.S. sanctions. Because of U.S. political pressure, Venezuela today exports most of its oil to China, according to Reuters.",
      "By comparison, the U.S. \u2014 the world's largest oil producer \u2014 churns out 13.5 billion barrels per day, according to the Energy Information Administration. Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter and leading OPEC producer, pumps an estimated 10 million to 12 million barrels, while No. 3 Russia produces 9.4 million.",
      "Francisco J. Monaldi, director of the Latin America energy program at Rice University, predicted it would take at least a decade \u2014 and investments of more than $100 billion \u2014 to rebuild Venezuela's oil infrastructure and lift production to 4 million barrels per day, which is well above its historical production levels.",
      "But doesn't Venezuela have more oil in the ground?",
      "Yes, Venezuela is estimated to have the world's largest proven oil reserves, with more than 303 billion barrels \u2014 that represents roughly 17% of the total global oil supply, OPEC data shows.",
      "\"The bottom line is that the size of the reserves is only paralleled by the ones in the Middle East, in the Persian Gulf and Canada's reserves,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Venezuela's reserves top second-ranked Saudi Arabia's 267 billion barrels, and are more than six times the U.S.'s reserves. Most of Venezuela's untapped oil is located in what is known as the Orinoco Belt, a roughly 21,000-square-mile area that stretches across the country's northeastern region.",
      "Are American oil companies already operating in Venezuela, and does the U.S. restrict the country's oil industry?",
      "Only one U.S. oil company operates in Venezuela today: Houston-based Chevron, which now accounts for 25% of Venezuelan oil production.",
      "\"No other major Western player produces any significant amount,\" Monaldi told CBS News.",
      "Other American energy giants, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips, withdrew from Venezuela after former President Hugo Chavez nationalized private foreign oil interests starting in 2006.",
      "Since 2005, successive U.S. presidents have imposed a range of sanctions on Venezuela, including its oil sector, for what American officials have said is the country's failure to crack down on drug trafficking and terrorism, along with alleged human rights abuses.",
      "Under former President Joe Biden, the U.S. in 2019 also froze the assets of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), and barred Americans from doing business with the enterprise.",
      "Most recently, the Trump administration imposed sanctions on four companies and associated oil tankers that it said have ties to Venezuela's oil sector.",
      "Earlier in December, Mr. Trump called for a \"total and complete blockade\" on all sanctioned oil tankers that enter or leave Venezuela, and the U.S.\u00a0seized two sanctioned vessels.",
      "Chevron can maintain its presence in Venezuela under a waiver granted by the Biden administration in 2022, when the U.S. faced soaring inflation and energy prices. President Trump extended that special license last year.",
      "How could regime change in Venezuela affect oil prices?",
      "Any significant disruption to global oil supplies could drive up energy prices around the world. Yet Venezuela's limited crude production is likely to mute any immediate impact on oil prices, which fell modestly in afternoon trading on Saturday, according to FactSet.",
      "Prices for U.S. oil saw a steep decrease in 2025, dropping roughly 20% and extending a decline over the previous two years. In trading on Friday, the price of West Texas Crude (the U.S. standard) fell to $57.32 a barrel, down from nearly $80 in January.",
      "Other factors could limit any short-term impact on domestic energy prices. U.S. production of crude has surged in recent years, helping lower gas prices. The U.S. has also beefed up its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, according to the Energy Information Administration, another potential cushion for consumers and businesses from volatility in global oil markets.",
      "\"Global supply remains ample, Venezuelan production represents a small share of worldwide output and there's no clear evidence yet of sustained disruption to physical flows,\" Nigel Green, CEO of investment advisory firm deVere Group, said in an email.",
      "Wall Street analysts expect relatively little impact when U.S. financial markets reopen on Monday.",
      "\"Investors have dealt with a series of ostensibly seismic geopolitical events for the last several years (Ukraine, Gaza, Iran, Libya, etc.), but none had a sustained impact on markets, and it's unlikely the events in Venezuela will be any different,\" said Adam Crisafulli, head of investment adviser VitalKnowledge.",
      "Meanwhile, major economies around the world are growing at a rate expected to keep oil prices in check, given the current surplus in crude supplies and sufficient production capacity among key producers, experts note.",
      "In the short term, an end to the U.S. blockade could even reduce oil prices, Monaldi said. \"Venezuela was exporting about 800,000 barrels before the blockade. If those go back to the market, that eases pressures.\"",
      "However, a prolonged slump in Venezuelan oil production could affect some energy costs. For example, the country produces a form of crude suitable for making diesel, which is widely used in many industries.",
      "As a result, removing Venezuela's oil input from global markets could push up diesel costs in the U.S. and boost inflation, according to a recent analysis by the Atlantic Council, a nonpartisan group focused on global political and economic affairs.",
      "\"Limited price impact reflects where the barrels go and how much spare capacity exists. It doesn't mean the risk is negligible,\" Green said.",
      "Will U.S. companies want to restart operations in Venezuela?",
      "To boost its oil production, Venezuela will need to rely on private investors because its state-run oil company, PDVSA, is in financial ruin, Monaldi told CBS News. That could open the door for U.S. companies to reenter the market. With new investment, Venezuela's existing infrastructure would allow the country to ramp up oil production relatively quickly, he added.",
      "To be sure, any such investment is likely to hinge on political developments following the U.S. strikes and Maduro's removal, said Monaldi, noting that Venezuela would need to offer commercial, fiscal and contractual incentives to lure American energy producers.",
      "\"Venezuela doesn't have limits in terms of the resources,\" he said. \"It's about the politics.\"",
      "In the near\u00a0term, Chevron stands to benefit the most, given its existing footprint in Venezuela, according to Monaldi. Other U.S. companies that might bring business back to Venezuela include ConocoPhillips and Exxon, he added.",

      "A vaccine to protect against fentanyl\u2019s deadly effects is headed for clinical trials in humans.",
      "The vaccine, which showed positive results in studies of mice and rats, is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses.",

      "This is different than treatments like naloxone, which reverse the effects after an overdose.",

      "It contains a synthetic fragment of fentanyl attached to a protein called CRM197, along with dmLT, an immune-activating compound.",
      "The vaccine is designed to block fentanyl from entering the brain, blocking its effects and preventing overdoses. (iStock)",
      "This combination stimulates the immune system to produce antibodies that capture fentanyl in the bloodstream before it can reach the brain, according to the University of Houston's Colin Haile, co-founder and scientific advisor of ARMR Sciences, which licensed the vaccine.",
      "\"In a vaccinated individual, those anti-fentanyl antibodies are in the blood,\" Haile told Fox News Digital. \"So, if they consume fentanyl, the antibodies grab onto the drug and prevent it from getting into the brain. They would feel no effects if they ingest fentanyl \u2014 absolutely none. And they would not overdose.\"",

      "After the Phase 1 trial for safety, a Phase 2 trial will test whether the vaccine effectively blocks fentanyl\u2019s effects in humans.",
      "Potential risks and limitations",
      "The primary limitation is that data so far is available only for mouse models, and it\u2019s unknown how effective the vaccine would be in humans.",
      "Haile told Fox News Digital there were no adverse side effects reported in the animal study, likely because the ingredients of the vaccine are proteins that have already been used in other combinations in humans, so their safety profile is already known.",

      "No. 1: Cost",

We will keep working to provide more options \u2014 expanding choices for delivery devices and creating new pathways for access \u2014 so more people can get the medicines they need.\"",
      "No. 2: Side effects",
      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Dr. Sue Decotiis, a medical weight loss doctor in New York City, confirmed that more than half of seniors stop taking a GLP-1 medication due to cost or side effects.",
      "Gastrointestinal side effects are the most common side effect of GLP-1s. (iStock)",

      "Muscle loss, which is another side effect of GLP-1 medications, can be \"detrimental\" in this age group, Decotiis cautioned.",

Smith had brought charges against Trump in both cases.",

      "The subpoenas to the phone companies were accompanied by gag orders blocking the lawmakers from learning about the existence of the subpoenas for at least one year. Smith said the D.C. federal court, which authorized the gag orders, would not have been aware that they applied to Congress members.\" I don\u2019t think we identified that, because I don\u2019t think that was Department policy at the time,\" Smith said.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Cybercriminals don't always need malware or exploits to break into systems anymore. Sometimes, they just need the right words in the right place. OpenAI is now openly acknowledging that reality. The company says prompt injection attacks against artificial intelligence (AI)-powered browsers are not a bug that can be fully patched, but a long-term risk that comes with letting AI agents roam the open web. This raises uncomfortable questions about how safe these tools really are, especially as they gain more autonomy and access to your data.",

      "NEW MALWARE CAN READ YOUR CHATS AND STEAL YOUR MONEY",
      "AI-powered browsers can read and act on web content, which also makes them vulnerable to hidden instructions attackers can slip into pages or documents. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why prompt injection isn't going away",
      "In a recent blog post, OpenAI admitted that prompt injection attacks are unlikely to ever be completely eliminated. Prompt injection works by hiding instructions inside web pages, documents or emails in ways that humans don't notice, but AI agents do. Once the AI reads that content, it can be tricked into following malicious instructions.",
      "OpenAI compared this problem to scams and social engineering. You can reduce them, but you can't make them disappear. The company also acknowledged that \"agent mode\" in its ChatGPT Atlas browser increases risk because it expands the attack surface. The more an AI can do on your behalf, the more damage it can cause when something goes wrong.",
      "OpenAI launched the ChatGPT Atlas browser in October, and security researchers immediately started testing its limits. Within hours, demos appeared showing that a few carefully placed words inside a Google Doc could influence how the browser behaved. That same day, Brave published its own warning, explaining that indirect prompt injection is a structural problem for AI-powered browsers, including tools like Perplexity's Comet.",
      "This isn't just OpenAI's problem. Earlier this month, the National Cyber Security Centre in the U.K. warned that prompt injection attacks against generative AI systems may never be fully mitigated.",
      "FAKE AI CHAT RESULTS ARE SPREADING DANGEROUS MAC MALWARE",
      "Prompt injection attacks exploit trust at scale, allowing malicious instructions to influence what an AI agent does without the user ever seeing it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The risk trade-off with AI browsers",
      "OpenAI says it views prompt injection as a long-term security challenge that requires constant pressure, not a one-time fix. Its approach relies on faster patch cycles, continuous testing and layered defenses. That puts it broadly in line with rivals like Anthropic and Google, which have both argued that agentic systems need architectural controls and ongoing stress testing.",
      "Where OpenAI is taking a different approach is with something it calls an \"LLM-based automated attacker.\" In simple terms, OpenAI trained an AI to act like a hacker. Using reinforcement learning, this attacker bot looks for ways to sneak malicious instructions into an AI agent's workflow.",
      "The bot runs attacks in simulation first. It predicts how the target AI would reason, what steps it would take and where it might fail. Based on that feedback, it refines the attack and tries again. Because this system has insight into the AI's internal decision-making, OpenAI believes it can surface weaknesses faster than real-world attackers.",
      "Even with these defenses, AI browsers aren't safe. They combine two things attackers love: autonomy and access. Unlike regular browsers, they don't just display information, but also read emails, scan documents, click links and take actions on your behalf. That means a single malicious prompt hidden in a webpage, document or message can influence what the AI does without you ever seeing it. Even when safeguards are in place, these agents operate by trusting content at scale, and that trust can be manipulated.",
      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "As AI browsers gain more autonomy and access to personal data, limiting permissions and keeping human confirmation in the loop becomes critical for safety. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7 steps you can take to reduce risk with AI browsers",
      "You may not be able to eliminate prompt injection attacks, but you can significantly limit their impact by changing how you use AI tools.",
      "Only give an AI browser access to what it absolutely needs. Avoid connecting your primary email account, cloud storage or payment methods unless there's a clear reason. The more data an AI can see, the more valuable it becomes to attackers. Limiting access reduces the blast radius if something goes wrong.",
      "Never allow an AI browser to send emails, make purchases or modify account settings without asking you first. Confirmation breaks long attack chains and gives you a moment to spot suspicious behavior. Many prompt injection attacks rely on the AI acting quietly in the background without user review.",
      "A password manager ensures every account has a unique, strong password. If an AI browser or malicious page leaks one credential, attackers can't reuse it elsewhere. Many password managers also refuse to autofill on unfamiliar or suspicious sites, which can alert you that something isn't right before you manually enter anything.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Even if an attack starts inside the browser, antivirus software can still detect suspicious scripts, unauthorized system changes or malicious network activity. Strong antivirus software focuses on behavior, not just files, which is critical when dealing with AI-driven or script-based attacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com",
      "Telling an AI browser to \"handle whatever is needed\" gives attackers room to manipulate it through hidden prompts. Be specific about what the AI is allowed to do and what it should never do. Narrow instructions make it harder for malicious content to influence the agent.",
      "When an AI browser scans emails, documents or web pages for you, remember that hidden instructions can live inside that content. Treat AI-generated actions as drafts or suggestions, not final decisions. Review anything the AI plans to act on before approving it.",
      "Security fixes for AI browsers evolve quickly as new attack techniques emerge. Delaying updates leaves known weaknesses open longer than necessary. Turning on automatic updates ensures you get protection as soon as they're available, even if you miss the announcement.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "There's been a meteoric rise in AI browsers. We're now seeing them from major tech companies, including OpenAI's Atlas, The Browser Company's Dia and Perplexity's Comet. Even existing browsers like Chrome and Edge are pushing hard to add AI and agentic features into their current infrastructure. While these browsers can be useful, the technology is still early. It's best not to fall for the hype and to wait for it to mature.",

      "Most robot headlines follow a familiar script: a machine masters one narrow trick in a controlled lab, then comes the bold promise that everything is about to change. I usually tune those stories out. We have heard about robots taking over since science fiction began, yet real-life robots still struggle with basic flexibility. This time felt different.",

      "ELON MUSK TEASES A FUTURE RUN BY ROBOTS",
      "Researchers highlight the milestone that shows how a robot learned 1,000 real-world tasks in just one day. (Science Robotics)",
      "How robots learned 1,000 physical tasks in one day",
      "A new report published in Science Robotics caught our attention because the results feel genuinely meaningful, impressive and a little unsettling in the best way. The research comes from a team of academic scientists working in robotics and artificial intelligence, and it tackles one of the field's biggest limitations.",
      "The researchers taught a robot to learn 1,000 different physical tasks in a single day using just one demonstration per task. These were not small variations of the same movement. The tasks included placing, folding, inserting, gripping and manipulating everyday objects in the real world. For robotics, that is a big deal.",
      "Why robots have always been slow learners",
      "Until now, teaching robots physical tasks has been painfully inefficient. Even simple actions often require hundreds or thousands of demonstrations. Engineers must collect massive datasets and fine-tune systems behind the scenes. That is why most factory robots repeat one motion endlessly and fail as soon as conditions change. Humans learn differently. If someone shows you how to do something once or twice, you can usually figure it out. That gap between human learning and robot learning has held robotics back for decades. This research aims to close that gap.",
      "THE NEW ROBOT THAT COULD MAKE CHORES A THING OF THE PAST",
      "The research team behind the study focuses on teaching robots to learn physical tasks faster and with less data. (Science Robotics)",
      "How the robot learned 1,000 tasks so fast",
      "The breakthrough comes from a smarter way of teaching robots to learn from demonstrations. Instead of memorizing entire movements, the system breaks tasks into simpler phases. One phase focuses on aligning with the object, and the other handles the interaction itself. This method relies on artificial intelligence, specifically an AI technique called imitation learning that allows robots to learn physical tasks from human demonstrations.",
      "The robot then reuses knowledge from previous tasks and applies it to new ones. This retrieval-based approach allows the system to generalize rather than start from scratch each time. Using this method, called Multi-Task Trajectory Transfer, the researchers trained a real robot arm on 1,000 distinct everyday tasks in under 24 hours of human demonstration time.",
      "Importantly, this was not done in a simulation. It happened in the real world, with real objects, real mistakes and real constraints. That detail matters.",
      "Why this research feels different",
      "Many robotics papers look impressive on paper but fall apart outside perfect lab conditions. This one stands out because it tested the system through thousands of real-world rollouts. The robot also showed it could handle new object instances it had never seen before. That ability to generalize is what robots have been missing. It is the difference between a machine that repeats and one that adapts.",
      "AI VIDEO TECH FAST-TRACKS HUMANOID ROBOT TRAINING",
      "The robot arm practices everyday movements like gripping, folding and placing objects using a single human demonstration. (Science Robotics)",
      "A long-standing robotics problem may finally be cracking",
      "This research addresses one of the biggest bottlenecks in robotics: inefficient learning from demonstrations. By decomposing tasks and reusing knowledge, the system achieved an order of magnitude improvement in data efficiency compared to traditional approaches. That kind of leap rarely happens overnight. It suggests that the robot-filled future we have talked about for years may be nearer than it looked even a few years ago.",
      "What this means for you",
      "Faster learning changes everything. If robots need less data and less programming, they become cheaper and more flexible. That opens the door to robots working outside tightly controlled environments.",
      "In the long run, this could enable home robots to learn new tasks from simple demonstrations instead of specialist code. It also has major implications for healthcare, logistics and manufacturing.",
      "More broadly, it signals a shift in artificial intelligence. We are moving away from flashy tricks and toward systems that learn in more human-like ways. Not smarter than people. Just closer to how we actually operate day to day.",

When machines start learning more like humans, the conversation changes. The question shifts from what robots can repeat to what they can adapt to next. That shift is worth paying attention to.",

      "Cybercriminals have always chased whatever people trust the most. First, it was email. Then search results. Now it's AI chat answers. Researchers are warning about a new campaign where fake AI conversations are showing up in Google search results and quietly pushing Mac users to install dangerous malware. What makes this especially risky is that everything looks helpful, legitimate and step-by-step, right up until your system is compromised.",
      "The malware being spread is Atomic macOS Stealer, often called AMOS, and the attacks abuse conversations generated by tools people increasingly rely on for everyday help. Investigators have confirmed that both ChatGPT and Grok were misused as part of this campaign.",

      "THIRD-PARTY BREACH EXPOSES CHATGPT ACCOUNT DETAILS",
      "One copied terminal command is all it takes for malware like AMOS to quietly install itself on a Mac. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How fake AI chat results lead to malware",
      "Researchers traced one infection back to a simple Google search: \"clear disk space on macOS.\" Instead of landing on a normal help article, the user was shown what looked like an AI conversation result embedded directly in search. That conversation offered clear, confident instructions and ended by telling the user to run a command in the macOS Terminal. That command installed AMOS.",
      "When researchers followed the same trail, they found multiple poisoned AI conversations appearing for similar searches. That consistency strongly suggests this was a deliberate operation aimed at Mac users searching for routine maintenance help.",
      "If this feels familiar, it should. A previous campaign used sponsored search results and SEO-poisoned links that pointed to fake macOS software hosted on GitHub. In that case, attackers impersonated legitimate apps and walked users through terminal commands that installed the same AMOS infostealer.",
      "According to researchers, once the terminal command is executed, the infection chain kicks off immediately. The base64 string in the command decodes into a URL that hosts a malicious bash script. That script is designed to harvest credentials, escalate privileges and establish persistence, all without triggering a visible security warning.",
      "The danger here is how clean the process looks. There's no installer window, obvious permission prompt or any option for you to review what's about to run. Because everything happens through the command line, normal download protections are sidestepped and the attacker gets to execute whatever they want.",
      "MICROSOFT TYPOSQUATTING SCAM SWAPS LETTERS TO STEAL LOGINS",
      "Fake AI chat results can look polished and trustworthy, even when they are designed to trick you into running harmful commands. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why is this attack so effective?",
      "This campaign combines two powerful ideas. Trust in AI answers and trust in search results. Most major chat tools, including Grok on X, let users delete parts of conversations or share only selected snippets. That means an attacker can carefully curate a short, polished exchange that looks genuinely helpful while hiding the manipulative prompts that produced it.",
      "Using prompt engineering, attackers get ChatGPT to generate a step-by-step cleanup or installation guide that actually installs malware. ChatGPT's sharing feature then creates a public link that lives inside the attacker's account. From there, criminals either pay for sponsored search placement or use SEO tactics to push that shared conversation high in the results.",
      "Some ads are designed to look almost identical to legitimate links. Unless you check who the advertiser actually is, it's easy to assume it's safe. One example documented by researchers showed a sponsored result advertising a fake \"Atlas\" browser for macOS, complete with professional branding.",
      "Once those links are live, attackers don't need to do much else. They wait for users to search, click, trust the AI output and follow the instructions exactly as written.",

      "Attackers rely on trust in search results and AI answers, knowing most people will not question step-by-step instructions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "AI tools are useful, but attackers are now shaping answers that lead you straight into trouble. These steps help you stay protected without giving up search or AI entirely.",
      "This is the most important rule. If an AI response or webpage tells you to open Terminal and paste a command, stop. Legitimate macOS fixes almost never require you to blindly run scripts copied from the internet. Once you press Enter, you lose visibility into what happens next. Malware like AMOS relies on this moment of trust to bypass normal security checks.",
      "AI chats are not authoritative sources. They can be manipulated through prompt engineering to produce dangerous step-by-step guides that look clean and confident. Before acting on any AI-generated fix, cross-check it with Apple's official documentation or a trusted developer site. If you cannot verify it easily, do not run it.",
      "A password manager creates strong, unique passwords for every account you use. If malware steals one password, it cannot unlock everything else. Many password managers also refuse to autofill credentials on fake or unfamiliar sites, which can alert you that something is wrong before you type anything manually. This single tool dramatically reduces the impact of credential-stealing malware.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com",
      "AMOS and similar malware often rely on known weaknesses after the initial infection. Updates patch these holes. Delaying updates gives attackers more room to escalate privileges or maintain persistence. Turn on automatic updates so you are protected even if you forget.",
      "Modern macOS malware often runs through scripts and memory-only techniques. A strong antivirus software doesn't just scan files. It monitors behavior, flags suspicious scripts, and can stop malicious activity even when nothing obvious is downloaded. This is especially important when malware is delivered through Terminal commands.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Paid search ads can look almost identical to legitimate results. Always check who the advertiser is before clicking. If a sponsored result leads to an AI conversation, a download or instructions to run commands, close it immediately.",
      "Search results promising quick fixes, disk cleanup or performance boosts are common malware entry points. If a guide is not hosted by Apple or a well-known developer, assume it could be risky, especially if it pushes command-line solutions.",
      "Attackers spend time making fake AI conversations look helpful and professional. Clear formatting and confident language are not signs of safety. They are often part of the deception. Slowing down and questioning the source is usually enough to break the attack chain.",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This campaign shows how attackers are shifting from breaking systems to manipulating trust. Fake AI conversations work because they sound calm, helpful and authoritative. When those conversations are boosted through search results, they inherit credibility they don't deserve. The technical tricks behind AMOS are complex, but the entry point is simple. Someone follows instructions without questioning where they came from.",

    "summary": "States require AI disclosure in healthcare as California, Colorado and Utah implement laws mandating transparency when artificial intelligence influences patient care decisions.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel takes a look at how artificial intelligence could vastly improve the healthcare system but points out human doctors are still needed in the equation on The Story.",
      "Artificial intelligence is quickly reshaping healthcare. It now supports diagnostic imaging, clinical decision tools, patient messages and back office workflows. According to the World Economic Forum, 4.5 billion people still lack access to essential care, and the global health worker shortage could reach 11 million by 2030. AI could help close that gap.",
      "However, as AI becomes more embedded in care, regulators are zeroing in on a simple question. Should patients be told when AI plays a role in their care?",
      "In the United States, no single federal law requires broad AI disclosure in healthcare. Instead, a growing patchwork of state laws is filling that gap. Some states require clear disclosure. Others mandate transparency indirectly through limits on how AI can be used.",

      "STATE-LEVEL AI RULES SURVIVE \u2014 FOR NOW \u2014 AS SENATE SINKS MORATORIUM DESPITE WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE",
      "AI now supports many healthcare decisions, from patient communications to coverage reviews, making transparency more important than ever for trust and accountability. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why AI disclosure matters for trust",
      "Transparency is not a technical detail, it is a trust issue. Research across industries shows people expect to be informed when AI affects decisions that matter to them. In healthcare, that expectation is even stronger. An analysis published by CX Today found that when AI use is hidden, trust erodes quickly, even when outcomes are accurate.",
      "Healthcare depends on trust. Patients follow treatment plans, share sensitive information and stay engaged when they believe care decisions are ethical and accountable.",
      "How AI disclosure connects to HIPAA and informed consent",
      "While HIPAA does not directly regulate artificial intelligence, its principles still apply. Covered entities must clearly explain how protected health information is used and safeguarded.",
      "When AI systems analyze or generate clinical information using patient data, nondisclosure can undermine that goal. Patients may not fully understand how their information shapes care decisions.",
      "Disclosure also supports informed consent. Patients have the right to understand material factors influencing diagnosis, treatment, or care communications. Just as clinicians disclose new procedures or medical devices, meaningful AI use should be explained, so patients can ask questions and stay involved in their care.",
      "AI TOOLS COULD WEAKEN DOCTORS' SKILLS IN DETECTING COLON CANCER, STUDY SUGGESTS",
      "States are stepping in where federal rules fall short, creating new disclosure requirements when AI influences care access, claims, or treatment decisions. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does AI disclosure mean in healthcare?",
      "AI disclosure means informing patients or members when artificial intelligence systems are used in healthcare-related decisions. This can include clinical messages, diagnostic support tools, utilization review, claims processing or coverage determinations. The goal is transparency, accountability and patient trust.",
      "Healthcare activities most likely to trigger disclosure",
      "According to analysis from Morgan Lewis, disclosure requirements most often apply when AI is used for:",
      "Patient-facing clinical communicationsUtilization review and utilization managementClaims processing and coverage decisionsMental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "Patient-facing clinical communications",
      "Utilization review and utilization management",
      "Claims processing and coverage decisions",
      "Mental health or therapeutic interactions",
      "These areas are considered high impact because they directly affect access to care and understanding of health information.",
      "Risks of failing to disclose AI use",
      "Healthcare organizations that fail to disclose AI use face real consequences. These include increased litigation risk, reputational damage and erosion of patient trust. Ethical concerns around autonomy and transparency can also trigger regulatory scrutiny.",
      "MORE AMERICANS ARE TURNING TO AI FOR HEALTH ADVICE",
      "Clear AI disclosure helps patients stay informed and involved, reinforcing that licensed healthcare professionals remain responsible for every medical decision. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How states are shaping AI disclosure rules",
      "States are taking different paths to regulate healthcare AI, but most are starting with one common goal: greater transparency when technology influences care.",
      "California has taken one of the most comprehensive approaches.",
      "AB 3030 requires clinics and physician offices that use generative AI for patient communications to include a clear disclaimer. Patients must also be told how to reach a human healthcare professional.",
      "SB 1120 applies to health plans and disability insurers. It requires safeguards when AI is used for utilization review. It also mandates disclosure and confirms that licensed professionals make medical necessity decisions.",
      "Colorado's SB24 205 targets AI systems considered high risk. These are tools that materially influence decisions like approval or denial of healthcare services.",
      "Entities must implement safeguards against algorithmic discrimination and disclose AI use. While broader than clinical care alone, the law directly affects patient access decisions.",
      "Utah has layered disclosure rules that intersect with healthcare.",
      "HB 452 requires mental health chatbots to clearly disclose AI use. SB 149 and SB 226 extend disclosure requirements to regulated occupations, including healthcare professionals.",
      "This approach ensures transparency in therapeutic interactions and clinical services.",
      "Other states that are expanding AI transparency",
      "Several other states are moving in the same direction. Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Tennessee and New York are all considering or enforcing rules that require disclosure and human review when AI influences utilization review or claims outcomes. Even when clinical diagnosis is not covered, these laws push accountability where AI affects care access.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a patient, expect more transparency. You may see disclosures in messages, coverage notices or digital interactions. If you work in healthcare, AI governance is no longer optional. Disclosure practices must align across clinical, administrative, and digital systems. Training staff and updating patient notices will matter as much as the technology itself. Trust will increasingly depend on how openly AI is introduced into care.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "AI can improve efficiency, expand access, and support clinicians. Yet its value depends on trust. Disclosure does not slow innovation. It strengthens confidence in both the technology and the professionals who use it. As states continue to act, transparency will likely become the norm rather than the exception in healthcare AI.",

      "Why data brokers make it so hard to delete your information",
      "Technically, data brokers have to delete your data if you request it. But here's the part they don't advertise: They want you to give up. Some brokers hide their opt-out pages behind dozens of clicks. Others require you to fax forms, upload IDs, or repeat the request every 30\u201390 days because they\u00a0reactivate your profile without warning.

      "We could not let 2025 end without one last reminder about digital safety. Cybercriminals never slow down. In fact, the holidays and the start of a new year often bring a surge in scams, account takeovers and data theft. The good news is that cybersecurity need not feel overwhelming. You do not need advanced skills or expensive tools. With a few smart habits, you can lower your risk and protect your digital life throughout 2026. To help you start the year strong, here are 10 simple cybersecurity resolutions that actually work.",

      "AMERICA'S MOST-USED PASSWORD IN 2025 REVEALED",
      "Strong passwords and two-factor authentication stop most account takeovers before they start. (Peter Steffen/picture alliance)",
      "1) Start the year with strong passwords",
      "Passwords remain your first line of defense. Weak or reused passwords make it easy for attackers to break into multiple accounts at once. Use a unique password for every account. Longer passphrases work better than short, complex strings. A reputable password manager can generate and securely store passwords, so you do not have to memorize them. One rule matters most. Never reuse passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our #1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at Cyberguy.com.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere",
      "Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds a second step after your password. This usually includes a code from an app or a physical security key. Even if someone steals your password, 2FA can block access. App-based authenticators provide stronger protection than text messages. Turn it on for email, banking, social media and shopping accounts first.",
      "3) Audit your digital presence",
      "Old accounts create new risks. Take time to review shopping sites, forums, apps and subscriptions you no longer use. Delete what you do not need. Update privacy settings on what you keep. Share less personal information whenever possible, especially birthdays, locations and phone numbers. A smaller digital footprint limits abuse.",
      "5 SOCIAL MEDIA SAFETY TIPS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE",
      "Simple habits like updating software and thinking before you click block common scams. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Keep software and devices up to date",
      "Security updates fix real vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit. Skipping updates leaves doors open. Enable automatic updates for operating systems, browsers, apps, routers and smart devices. This habit blocks many common attacks without extra effort. Outdated software remains one of the top causes of successful hacks.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service",
      "Your personal information appears on hundreds of data broker sites. These sites collect names, addresses, phone numbers and relatives, then sell access to anyone willing to pay. A personal data removal service helps locate and remove that information. This step reduces scam attempts, phishing messages and identity fraud risks throughout the year. Less exposed data means fewer threats.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web: Cyberguy.com",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection",
      "Identity theft often starts quietly. A breach happens. Data leaks. Fraud follows months later. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Many services can also scan for accounts tied to multiple email addresses, making cleanup easier. Early alerts help you act before damage spreads.",
      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at Cyberguy.com.",
      "PROTECT YOURSELF FROM SNEAKY WEB INJECTION SCAMS",
      "Backups, secure Wi-Fi and identity monitoring help limit damage when breaches happen. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "7) Think before you click and use strong antivirus protection",
      "Most cyberattacks still begin with a click. Fake shipping notices, refund alerts and urgent messages push people to act fast. Pause before clicking links or opening attachments. Many scams now use AI to generate realistic messages, fake voices and convincing images, making it even more important to pause before you click. Verify messages through official websites or apps instead. Strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection by blocking malware, ransomware and malicious downloads across your devices, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "8) Secure your home Wi-Fi network",
      "Your Wi-Fi network connects everything. That makes it a valuable target. Change the default router password right away. Enable WPA3 encryption if your router supports it. Keep router firmware up to date and avoid sharing your network with unknown devices. A secure network protects every connected device.",
      "9) Back up your data regularly",
      "Backups protect you from ransomware, hardware failure and accidental deletion. Many people still skip them. Use cloud backups, an external hard drive or both. Automate the process so it runs without reminders. If something goes wrong, backups let you recover quickly.",
      "10) Freeze your credit if you do not need it",
      "A credit freeze prevents new accounts from opening in your name. It remains one of the strongest defenses against identity fraud heading into 2026. Freezing credit is free and reversible. You can temporarily lift it when applying for loans or credit cards. This single step blocks many identity crimes outright. To learn more about how to do this, go to Cyberguy.com and search \"How to freeze your credit.\"",
      "Pro tip: Lock down your email and use aliases",
      "Your email account controls password resets, alerts and account recovery. If attackers get in, they can reach nearly everything else. Secure your primary email with a long, unique password and two-factor authentication. Then create email aliases for shopping, subscriptions and sign-ups. Aliases limit exposure when a company suffers a data breach and make phishing easier to spot. Protecting email this way strengthens every other cybersecurity resolution.",
      "By creating email aliases, you can protect your information and reduce spam. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",
      "For recommendations on private and secure email providers that offer alias addresses, visit Cyberguy.com.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "A safer digital life starts with small, consistent decisions. Strong passwords, updates, backups and awareness go a long way. By committing to these cybersecurity resolutions, you set yourself up for a more secure 2026. You also make it harder for criminals to profit from stolen data. There is no better time to start than now.",

Attackers are using the domain rnicrosoft.com to impersonate Microsoft and steal login credentials. The trick is simple. Instead of the letter m, scammers place r and n side by side.

      "Why your brain falls for the rn trick",
      "This attack relies on how people read. Your brain predicts words instead of scanning each letter. When something looks familiar, you fill in the gaps automatically. On a large desktop monitor, a careful reader might spot the flaw. On a phone, the risk jumps. The address bar often shortens URLs, and the screen leaves little room for close inspection. That is exactly where attackers want you. Once trust is established, you are more likely to enter passwords, approve fake invoices or download harmful attachments.",

The faster you act, the less likely you are to notice the mistake.",
      "Why these fake domains keep working",
      "Most people do not slow down to read URLs character by character. Familiar logos and language reinforce trust, especially during a busy workday. Mobile use makes this worse. Smaller screens, shortened links and constant notifications create perfect conditions for mistakes. This is not a Microsoft-only problem. Banks, retailers, healthcare portals and government services all face the same risk.",

      "Before clicking anything, open the full sender address in the email header. Display names and logos are easy to fake, but domains tell the real story.

Legitimate companies do not require you to act through surprise links, and this habit cuts off most typosquatting attempts instantly.",

      "Megan Garcia, a mother who lost her son to suicide after he allegedly became emotionally attached to an AI chatbot, discusses the dangers of the technology on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019",
      "OpenAI says it is taking stronger steps to protect teens using its chatbot. Recently, the company updated its behavior guidelines for users under 18 and released new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. The move comes as pressure mounts across the tech industry. Lawmakers, educators and child safety advocates want proof that AI companies can protect young users. Several recent tragedies have raised serious questions about the role AI chatbots may play in teen mental health. While the updates sound promising, many experts say the real test will be how these rules work in practice.",

      "What OpenAI's new teen rules actually say",
      "OpenAI's updated Model Spec builds on existing safety limits and applies to teen users ages 13 to 17. It continues to block sexual content involving minors and discourages self-harm, delusions and manic behavior. For teens, the rules go further. The models must avoid immersive romantic roleplay, first-person intimacy, and violent or sexual roleplay, even when non-graphic. They must use extra caution when discussing body image and eating behaviors. When safety risks appear, the chatbot should prioritize protection over user autonomy. It should also avoid giving advice that helps teens hide risky behavior from caregivers. These limits apply even if a prompt is framed as fictional, historical, or educational.",
      "The four principles OpenAI says it uses to protect teens",
      "OpenAI says its approach to teen users follows four core principles:",
      "Put teen safety first, even when it limits freedomEncourage real-world support from family, friends, or professionalsSpeak with warmth and respect without treating teens like adultsBe transparent and remind users that the AI is not human",
      "Put teen safety first, even when it limits freedom",
      "Encourage real-world support from family, friends, or professionals",
      "Speak with warmth and respect without treating teens like adults",
      "Be transparent and remind users that the AI is not human",
      "The company also shared examples of the chatbot refusing requests like romantic roleplay or extreme appearance changes.",
      "WHY PARENTS MAY WANT TO DELAY SMARTPHONES FOR KIDS",
      "The company updated its chatbot guidelines for users ages 13 to 17 and launched new AI literacy tools for parents and teens. (Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Teens are driving the AI safety debate",
      "Gen Z users are among the most active chatbot users today. Many rely on AI for homework help, creative projects and emotional support. OpenAI's recent deal with Disney could draw even more young users to the platform. That growing popularity has also brought scrutiny. Recently, attorneys general from 42 states urged major tech companies to add stronger safeguards for children and vulnerable users. At the federal level, proposed legislation could go even further. Some lawmakers want to block minors from using AI chatbots entirely.",
      "Why experts question whether AI safety rules work",
      "Despite the updates, many experts remain cautious. One major concern is engagement. Advocates argue chatbots often encourage prolonged interaction, which can become addictive for teens. Refusing certain requests could help break that cycle. Still, critics warn that examples in policy documents are not proof of consistent behavior. Past versions of the Model Spec banned excessive agreeableness, yet models continued mirroring users in harmful ways. Some experts link this behavior to what they call AI psychosis, where chatbots reinforce distorted thinking instead of challenging it.",
      "In one widely reported case, a teenager who later died by suicide spent months interacting with a chatbot. Conversation logs showed repeated mirroring and validation of distress. Internal systems flagged hundreds of messages related to self-harm. Yet the interactions continued. Former safety researchers later explained that earlier moderation systems reviewed content after the fact rather than in real time. That allowed harmful conversations to continue unchecked. OpenAI says it now uses real-time classifiers across text, images, and audio. When systems detect serious risk, trained reviewers may step in, and parents may be notified.",
      "Some advocates praise OpenAI for publicly sharing its under-18 guidelines. Many tech companies do not offer that level of transparency. Still, experts stress that written rules are not enough. What matters is how the system behaves during real conversations with vulnerable users. Without independent measurement and clear enforcement data, critics say these updates remain promises rather than proof.",
      "How parents can help teens use AI safely",
      "OpenAI says parents play a key role in helping teens use AI responsibly. The company stresses that tools alone are not enough. Active guidance matters most.",
      "OpenAI encourages regular conversations between parents and teens about how AI fits into daily life. These discussions should focus on responsible use and critical thinking. Parents are urged to remind teens that AI responses are not facts and can be wrong.",
      "OpenAI provides parental controls that let adults manage how teens interact with AI tools. These tools can limit features and add oversight. The company says safeguards are designed to reduce exposure to higher-risk topics and unsafe interactions. Here are the steps OpenAI recommends parents take.",
      "Confirm your teen's account statusParents should make sure their teen's account reflects the correct age. OpenAI applies stronger safeguards to accounts identified as belonging to users under 18.Review available parental controlsOpenAI offers parental controls that allow adults to tailor a teen's experience. These controls can limit certain features and add extra oversight around higher-risk topics.Understand content safeguardsTeen accounts are subject to stricter content rules. These safeguards reduce exposure to topics like self-harm, sexualized roleplay, dangerous activities, body image concerns and requests to hide unsafe behavior.Pay attention to safety notificationsIf the system detects signs of serious risk, OpenAI says additional safeguards may apply. In some cases, this can include reviews by trained staff and parent notifications.Revisit settings as features changeOpenAI recommends parents stay informed as new tools and features roll out. Safeguards may expand over time as the platform evolves.",

      "OpenAI says healthy use matters as much as content safety. To support balance, the company has added break reminders during long sessions. Parents are encouraged to watch for signs of overuse and step in when needed.",
      "OpenAI emphasizes that AI should never replace real relationships. Teens should be encouraged to turn to family, friends or professionals when they feel stressed or overwhelmed. The company says human support remains essential.",
      "Parents should make clear that AI can help with schoolwork or creativity. It should not become a primary source of emotional support.",
      "Parents are encouraged to ask what teens use AI for, when they use it and how it makes them feel. These conversations can reveal unhealthy patterns early.",
      "Experts advise parents to look for increased isolation, emotional reliance on AI or treating chatbot responses as authority. These can signal unhealthy dependence.",
      "Many specialists recommend keeping phones and laptops out of bedrooms overnight. Reducing late-night AI use can help protect sleep and mental health.",

      "Lawmakers and child safety advocates are demanding stronger safeguards as teens increasingly rely on AI chatbots. (Photographer: Gabby Jones/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "Parents and teens should enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on teen AI accounts whenever it is available. OpenAI allows users to turn on multi-factor authentication for ChatGPT accounts.",
      "To enable it, go to\u00a0OpenAI.com and sign in. Scroll down and click the\u00a0profile icon, then select\u00a0Settings and choose\u00a0Security. From there, turn on\u00a0multi-factor authentication (MFA). You will then be given two options. One option uses an authenticator app, which generates one-time codes during login. Another option sends 6-digit verification codes by text message through SMS or WhatsApp, depending on the country code. Enabling multi-factor authentication adds an extra layer of protection beyond a password and helps reduce the risk of unauthorized access to teen accounts.",
      "Also, consider adding a strong antivirus software that can help block malicious links, fake downloads, and other threats teens may encounter while using AI tools. This adds an extra layer of protection beyond any single app or platform.\u00a0 Using strong antivirus protection and two-factor authentication together helps reduce the risk of account takeovers that could expose teens to unsafe content or impersonation risks.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "OpenAI's updated teen safety rules show the company is taking growing concerns seriously. Clearer limits, stronger safeguards, and more transparency are steps in the right direction. Still, policies on paper are not the same as behavior in real conversations. For teens who rely on AI every day, what matters most is how these systems respond in moments of stress, confusion, or vulnerability. That is where trust is built or lost. For parents, this moment calls for balance. AI tools can be helpful and creative. They also require guidance, boundaries, and supervision. No set of controls can replace real conversations or human support. As AI becomes more embedded in our everyday lives, the focus must stay on outcomes, not intentions. Protecting teens will depend on consistent enforcement, independent oversight, and active family involvement.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on FoxNews.com.",
      "Ted Maher was convicted of setting the 1999 Monaco penthouse fire that killed billionaire Edmond Safra, but his criminal story didn\u2019t end there.",
      "From staged heroics and shifting identities to a later murder-for-hire plot against his wife, a crime expert says Maher\u2019s long arc offers rare insight into how certain offenders escalate rather than reform.",
      "According to former FBI special agent Jason Pack, Maher\u2019s behavior reflects a recognizable pattern among offenders who manufacture crises, seek control and continue deceiving long after their first crime is exposed.",
      "Maher, an American who said he had been a Green Beret, was a private nurse hired to care for Safra when a fire broke out inside Safra\u2019s heavily secured Monaco penthouse in the early hours of Dec. 3, 1999. Safra and another nurse, Vivian Torrente, died of smoke inhalation after locking themselves inside a bathroom believed to double as a safe room.",

      "Maher survived and initially told authorities that two hooded intruders armed with knives had broken into the apartment \u2014 a claim Monaco officials later said could not be corroborated, according to The New York Times.",
      "After days of conflicting accounts, Maher admitted to police that he had set the fire himself by igniting a wastepaper basket, Monaco\u2019s chief prosecutor Daniel Serdet said at the time, The Times reported. Maher told investigators he did not intend to kill anyone and said he had fabricated the intruder story to \"draw attention to himself,\" Serdet said.",
      "Serdet told reporters Maher was jealous of Safra\u2019s seven other nurses and hoped to win his employer\u2019s approval by staging a rescue. \"He wanted to be a hero,\" Serdet said, according to The Times.",
      "Public Prosecutor Daniel Serdet spoke to journalists on Jan. 22, 2003, at the Palace of Justice in Monaco, following the escape of Ted Maher and his Italian cellmate, Luigi Ciardelli. Maher, the American nurse sentenced to 10 years in prison for starting the fire that killed Lebanese banker Edmond Safra and his nurse, was apprehended alone a few hours after his escape. (Vanina Lucchesi/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Investigators said Maher slashed himself twice with his own knife \u2014 once in the thigh and once in the stomach \u2014 before seeking help from the building\u2019s concierge, The Times reported. Officials said Safra and Torrente could have escaped the fire but remained inside the locked bathroom because Safra feared attackers were still inside the apartment.",
      "Safra\u2019s death stunned the world of international banking and sparked widespread speculation about whether he had been targeted because of his business dealings. Newspapers around the world theorized that Safra, a Lebanese-born banker, may have been killed because of his financial relationships, including dealings involving Russian investors, The Times reported.",
      "Investigators ultimately rejected those theories. Serdet said Maher acted alone and that there was \"no complicated intrigue\" behind the fire, according to The Times.",
      "The fire came at a pivotal moment in Safra's life. According to The Times, he suffered from Parkinson\u2019s disease and was preparing to retire as a deal to sell his banking empire, including Republic National Bank of New York, neared completion.",

      "His death marked the loss of far more than a banking titan. He was not only one of the world\u2019s wealthiest bankers, but a major global philanthropist whose foundation has funded education, medical research, humanitarian aid and religious institutions across more than 40 countries \u2014 a legacy that continues decades after his death.",
      "According to The Times, Safra believed he had powerful enemies, a concern fueled by his banking career and cooperation with U.S. authorities, which contributed to the intense security measures inside the Monaco penthouse.",
      "Safra\u2019s security concerns were rooted in real events, according to Vanity Fair. Dominick Dunne, who wrote extensively about the case, said Safra had alerted U.S. authorities to Russian organized crime activity tied to his banking business \u2014 a move that left him deeply fearful.",
      "\"He turned in the Russian mafia to the FBI,\" Dunne told \"48 Hours.\" \"He became very paranoid about his safety.\"",
      "Pack said that environment is critical to understanding how Maher\u2019s original story took hold. In his view, Maher tailored his intruder narrative to fit Safra\u2019s fears, making the account initially plausible to investigators and the public.",
      "\"When a man spends decades trying to sell a \u2018hero\u2019 story,\" Pack said, \"you eventually have to stop listening to the music and start looking at the math.\"",
      "A new Netflix documentary, \"Murder in Monaco,\" has revived interest in the case and Maher\u2019s claims of innocence. But Pack said the most revealing evidence lies not in revisiting that night in 1999, but in the decades of conduct that followed.",
      "Pack said Maher\u2019s conduct since the Monaco case further undermines his claims of being a coerced or misunderstood figure.",
      "In 2002, Maher was convicted of arson causing death and sentenced to 10 years in prison. After serving roughly eight years in prison, he returned to the United States, changed his name and later became entangled in additional crimes.",

      "In 2025, Maher was convicted in New Mexico of soliciting the murder of his estranged wife in a plot prosecutors said involved staging her death as a fentanyl overdose.",
      "\"You don\u2019t go from \u2018misunderstood hero\u2019 to \u2018murder-for-hire\u2019 by accident,\" Pack said. \"That kind of behavior reveals a consistent operational mode.\"",
      "Pack described what he called a pattern of staged crises and deception. In Monaco, he said, Maher manufactured a fire to engineer a heroic rescue. Decades later, prosecutors said he plotted another staged event, this time with lethal intent to gain financially.",
      "Pack also pointed to Maher\u2019s decision to reinvent himself under a new name after prison as further evidence of deception rather than rehabilitation.",
      "General view taken Dec. 8, 1999, of the prison of Monaco where the American nurse of late billionaire banker Edmond Safra, Ted Maher, was detained after he was charged with arson causing death.

(Pascal Guyot/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "\"When someone changes his identity to escape his past, that conduct defines his character,\" Pack said.",
      "Maher has claimed for years that his confession in Monaco was coerced. But Pack said Maher\u2019s later actions severely undercut that narrative.",
      "\"It\u2019s easy to blame a foreign police force when you\u2019re the only one talking,\" Pack said. \"But when you\u2019re caught orchestrating a murder from a jail cell in New Mexico, the victim story is finished.\"",
      "Maher is currently incarcerated in New Mexico and has reportedly been dealing with late-stage throat cancer. Pack said that while only Maher knows exactly what happened in Monaco, his subsequent behavior provides a clearer picture than any reenactment.",

      "Thieves targeting the homes of people whose loved ones recently died is not a new tactic, but a law enforcement expert warns it may be resurfacing as criminals increasingly exploit publicly available information to predict when homes will be vacant.",
      "In California\u2019s South Bay, families say their loved ones\u2019 homes were burglarized shortly after obituaries were published, raising concerns that criminals may be scanning obituaries and funeral announcements to identify vulnerable properties while families are grieving.",
      "Retired Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Jeff Wenninger told Fox News Digital that while these cases feel especially cruel, the motivation behind them is typically not personal.",
      "\"Using obituaries is just one method of casing a location,\" Wenninger said. \"Really, we have to be pragmatic about predictability and vulnerability. Predictability is the suspect being able to predict when you will not be home.\"",

      "A woman grieves at a gravesite. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Wenninger explained that criminals rarely rely on a single detail. Instead, they piece together multiple indicators, including obituaries, memorial announcements and routine disruptions, to determine when a home, or even several homes connected to one family, may be unoccupied.",
      "\"When you\u2019re talking about using obituaries, that\u2019s just another means in which the suspects are able to find out and predict your movements and activity in order to exploit and victimize you by burglarizing your residence,\" he said.",

      "He noted that many of those cases involve organized burglary groups that plan ahead, move quickly and target specific valuables.",
      "\"These groups are very specific about what they want,\" Wenninger said. \"They\u2019re not going in to ransack a place. They want jewelry, watches, cash, and they want to get in and out fast.\"",

Security camera video obtained by the outlet shows at least two suspects entering the home and later leaving hours afterward, with one person seen carrying a safe.",

      "\"Who takes advantage of someone at the saddest and weakest moments of their life?\" the family member told KNTV.",

      "Wenninger said families can reduce risk by making homes appear occupied during funerals, travel or periods of loss, including having people come and go, keeping lights on and avoiding obvious signs of absence.",

      "PALM BEACH, Fla. \u2014 President Donald Trump gave the Venezuelan leader one last chance to step down.",
      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "The U.S. isn\u2019t leaving Venezuela soon, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to run it essentially until such time as a proper transition can take place.\u201d",
      "Looking back at his fateful phone call with Maduro, Trump suggested at the news conference that Maduro had chosen poorly in not heeding his command.",
      "\u201cNow,\u201d Trump said, \u201che wished he did.\u201d"

      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to \"demolish foreign drug cartels\" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would \"keep our citizens safe\" in keeping with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",

      "In Havana, Cuba\u2019s leadership labeled the attack \u201cstate terrorism,\u201d acutely aware that both Trump and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have openly questioned how long the Cuban government itself should remain untouched.",
      "Rubio\u2019s \u201cprimary interest is in Cuba, not in Venezuela,\u201d said Michael Paarlberg, a senior nonresident fellow at the Center for International Policy, noting that Rubio sees Venezuela \u201cas the chief patron of the Cuban regime.\u201d",
      "Asked during an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether the Trump administration\u2019s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, \u201cThe Cuban government is a huge problem.\u201d",
      "He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",

      "While past U.S. regime-change efforts in Cuba have failed, dating back decades, Paarlberg told NBC News the Cuban government would still likely \u201cbe worried about something like a direct parallel.\u201d",
      "The United States\u2019 traditional adversaries were not alone in their condemnation, with several left-leaning governments in Latin America warning the move risked destabilizing the region.",
      "Brazil said the U.S. had crossed an \u201cunacceptable line,\u201d warning the attack set an \u201cextremely dangerous precedent for the international community.\u201d Other democratic leaders in the region, including Colombia\u2019s Gustavo Petro, Mexico\u2019s Claudia Sheinbaum and Chile\u2019s Gabriel Boric, joined in denouncing the U.S. intervention.",
      "Legal experts also questioned the operation\u2019s legality.",

      "\u201cIf you detain someone unlawfully, if you take someone into your custody and you do not have the legal right to do that, then what else would you call it?\u201d she told NBC News.",
      "\u201cThe U.N. Charter makes it very clear that there are very few times when a country has the right to carry out military force on the territory of another country,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it never has the right to do that in order to bring an individual out to stand trial before their courts.\u201d",
      "Many European allies struck a careful balance, nodding to international law but without dissent in an effort to avoid upsetting the U.S.",

      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called the operation \u201ccomplex,\u201d and said his country \u201cwill take our time,\u201d to evaluate it, while European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she supported a peaceful and democratic transition of power, and that \u201cany solution must respect international law and the U.N. Charter.\u201d",
      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela \u201ccontravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,\u201d while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said it violated international law.",
      "But as reactions to the Venezuela strike largely fell along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "\u201cEuropean countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d he told NBC News, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because \u201cthey know that Greenland is in the firing line.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland, treating it as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, shared what he said was a \u201cfriendly reminder\u201d on X Saturday that \u201cwe expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\u201d pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike.",
      "Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, \u201chave very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.\u201d Europe, he said, was \u201cexpressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,\u201d raising the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of invoking a system that isn\u2019t backed by the strongest power in the world?\u201d",
      "But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been here eight years, eight years already,\u201d Yajaira said, referring to how long she\u2019s been in the U.S. \u201cThey killed my older brother. It was so tough. They kidnapped my brothers. That was tough. I thank God for all of this because it\u2019s been tough,\u201d she said, her voice breaking as she looked up at the sky.",
      "Throughout the morning, the growing crowds in Doral were chanting in Spanish, \u201cThe government is over, the government has fallen,\u201d amid the blasting car horns and music.",
      "Venezuelans started coming to Florida and the U.S. in large numbers in the early 2000s after socialist Hugo Ch\u00e1vez rose to power. The situation deteriorated drastically when Maduro took over in 2013. Under Maduro, the country\u2019s oil-driven economy has faced a decadelong collapse and an estimated 80% of residents live in poverty. Around 8 million Venezuelans have fled under his rule.",
      "President Donald Trump said the U.S. is \u201cgoing to run\u201d Venezuela following Maduro\u2019s capture \u201cuntil such time as a safe, proper and judicious transition can take place.\u201d He said Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodr\u00edguez has been sworn is as president; she has called for Maduro\u2019s release.",

In Cincinnati, Rossaly Nava, 43, a property manager, said, \u201cMy heart is racing \u2014 this is the biggest miracle that has happened in my lifetime. ...

      "\"People who claim the United States shouldn\u2019t have done that because it\u2019s about sovereignty, but it turns out that Venezuela hasn\u2019t had sovereignty for over 20 years because we don\u2019t have control of our oil, we don\u2019t have control of our natural resources, and we\u2019ve been robbed for many, many years,\" she said in Spanish.",

      "Ferro noted more than 6 in 10 Venezuelans in the U.S. came through temporary protected status, which the Trump administration has rescinded. She also urged Trump to recognize that there\u2019s a need for bipartisan support for Venezuelans. \u201cWhat we need is support in this critical moment,\u201d she said.",

      "What Happens to Eleven in the 'Stranger Things' Finale?",
      "The episode's title, \"The Rightside Up,\" indicates what happens in the finale: Things are put, well, right, and that involves the closing of the Upside Down, the portal that opened in Season 1.",
      "Eleven and Will (Noah Schnapp) defeat Vecna. But there's more that needs to be done: The Upside Down itself needs to be destroyed.",
      "Eleven seems to understand her role in the next phase of the plan, but others in her life are resistant. \"I have to end the cycle,\" Eleven tells Hopper (David Harbour), her adoptive father.",
      "He's skeptical, delivering a speech about her deserving a better life. \"Life has been so unfair to you. So cruel. But you never let it break you. I need you to fight, kid,\" Hopper says.",

      "So does he create a story that helps him cope with his new reality, or has he really picked up on an alternate explanation of Eleven's fate?",
      "At the end of the episode, the gang is back playing Dungeons and Dragons. Using their Dungeons and Dragons characters as stand-ins, Mike tells stories about all his friends and what happens to them next. The show then cuts to their futures, indicating that Mike got it right with his predictions.",

      "Ross Duffer said Eleven's death, or disappearance, was integral to the story ending. Eleven represents childhood \u2014 and the finale is all about the kids of \u201cStranger Things\u201d growing up.",
      "\"For us and our writers, we didn\u2019t want to take her powers away. She represents magic in a lot of ways and the magic of childhood. For our characters to move on and for the story of Hawkins and the Upside Down to come to a close, Eleven had to go away,\" Ross Duffer said.",
      "There was no way Eleven was going to carry out Hopper\u2019s dream of her becoming a \u201cregular\u201d girl, essentially.",
      "The Duffer brothers aren't ruling out whether she's alive, but confirm she's not coming back to the kids of Hawkins. That's the power of Mike's story, which allows her to remain a presence in their lives.",
      "\"If Eleven is out there, the most that they could hope for is a belief that it\u2019s true because they can\u2019t be in contact with her. Everything falls apart if that were the case. So if that\u2019s the narrative, this is really the best way to keep her alive. And it\u2019s about Mike and everyone finding a way to move past what\u2019s happened,\" Matt Duffer said."

      "In \"Marty Supreme,\" Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet plays Marty Mauser, a fictionalized version of Marty Reisman, a real life table tennis star whose heyday was the 1940s and '50s.",
      "\"Marty Supreme\" co-writer and director Josh Safdie told the Hollywood Reporter the movie is an \"homage\" to table tennis pro Reisman rather than a biography.",
      "In the movie, Chalamet's character is a New York City shoe salesman in the 1950s whose flashy skills with a ping-pong paddle \u2014 and his sheer bravado \u2014 take the small and gritty table tennis world by storm.",
      "Chalamet's Marty has a nose for trouble and will do just about anything, legal or otherwise, to scrape up the dough needed to travel to the sport's open in Tokyo.",
      "The real-life Marty Reisman, whose slim physique earned him the nickname \"The Needle,\" was known for his swaggering style and for bringing a bit of razzle-dazzle to an often, at least at the time, overlooked sport.",
      "Like the Hollywood version of him, the sharp-dressed Reisman's one and only goal was to be known as the best table tennis player in the world, a pursuit he once called \"noble.\"",
      "Read on to learn more about Marty Reisman, the real-life man who inspired \"Marty Supreme.\"",
      "Marty Reisman Was a Superstar Table Tennis Player",
      "Reisman was born in February 1930 in New York City, according to his 1974 memoir, \"The Money Player: The Confessions of America's Greatest Table Tennis Champion and Hustler.\"",
      "\"I was a cocky gregarious kid, a bit of a showman and a showoff even then,\" he wrote in his memoir \u2014 qualities he'd have the rest of his life.",
      "His bold personality and undeniably athletic skills helped him to become a legend in the table tennis world. In his biography, he talks about his love for gambling and betting \u2014 on himself.",
      "He won his first championship in 1946, becoming the United States Junior National Champion, a feat he repeated the next year.  He went on to win multiple others, including a United States Doubles Championship in 1949 and a Singles Championship in 1958.",
      "In 1997, when he was 67, he became the oldest person to win a national championship in a racket sport, per his obituary.",
      "He Started Playing the Game As a Child to Deal with Anxiety",

      "\u201cI had a nervous breakdown when I was 9 years old and ended up in Bellevue Hospital. Ping-Pong was the ultimate escape. My racket became a sensuous connection between the ball and my brain,\" he told Forbes for an interview published in 2005.",
      "By 13, Reisman had become a city junior champion, often hustling other players for money at Lawrence\u2019s Broadway Table Tennis Club in New York City, reported Forbes. When he was 16, he did a tour of England with a three-man exhibition team, wowing audiences with their paddle skills.",
      "As \"Marty Supreme\" depicts, Reisman worked briefly as a shoe salesman, his only foray into the 9-5 world. For the rest of his life, he relied on his ping-pong skills to make money, he told Forbes.",
      "\"No one has ever been less suited for regular employment than I was,\" he quipped.",
      "He Was Famous for Performing Flashy Tricks",
      "After Reisman learned audiences would pay to see him do tricks while playing ping-pong, he began appearing in special exhibitions.",
      "He and U.S. teammate Doug Cartland accepted an offer to be the opening act for three years for the basketball trickster the Harlem Globetrotters, delighting audiences by playing \u201cMary Had a Little Lamb\u201d using frying pans, according to his biography.",
      "Reisman's signature trick, which he showed off during a visit to \"The Late Night Show with David Letterman\" in 2008, was snapping a cigarette in half with a slam.",
      "\"No other player was willing to try it before a large audience. It can be embarrassing to miss four or five times in a row. It is impossible to explain the shot. It involves a communion between the racket, the ball, and the cigarette, and takes a great deal of confidence,\" he wrote in his memoir.",
      "He Was Obsessed with Being the Best at His Sport",
      "Reisman's goal was to be the best ping-pong player in the world. He talked about his passion for the sport in in his memoir.",
      "His earnings were enough to make him a three-time millionaire, fortunes he repeatedly lost, according to The New York Times.",
      "\u201cI took on people in the gladiatorial spirit,\u201d he told the Times in March 2012, just months before his death.",
      "He Was As Impish As Chalamet's Character",
      "Like Chalamet's character in \"Marty Supreme,\" Reisman was also a the bad boy of his sport.",
      "In 1949, Reisman traveled to the English Open where he and fellow American player Dick Miles traded their modest London hotel for swankier accommodations. The pair ran up a tab on room service and other luxuries, charging it all to the English Table Tennis Association, according to his memoir.",
      "When the English officials balked, refusing to pay the bill, Reisman and Miles said they wouldn't participate in their sold-out exhibition matches.",
      "The English officials ended up covering the costs but fined the men $200 and suspended them from sanctioned table tennis worldwide. Reisman wrote the sanction was lifted in 1950.",
      "Reisman Died in 2012",
      "Reisman died in December 2012 of complications of heart and lung ailments at the age of 82, according to The New York Times.",
      "His death was announced by Table Tennis Nation, an organization Reisman founded in 2010.",

      "Keep an eye on these books and set your new year off in literary style.",
      "Isaac Fitzgerald's picks",
      "\"The Rest of Our Lives\" by Ben Markovits",
      "Isaac says: \"'The Rest of Our Lives' is a brilliantly humane and wildly absorbing story. Benjamin Markovits\u2019s magnetic prose feels both effortless and precise, as we follow Tom Layward who \u2014 after dropping his daughter off at college \u2014 just keeps driving. Here is a book that will find its home amongst the other great American road trip novels. An absolute triumph.\"",
      "\"On Morrison\" by Namwali Serpell",
      "Isaac says: \"'On Morrison' is a dazzling work of criticism. Namwali Serpell uses intellectual rigor alongside inventive flair to tackle Toni Morrison\u2019s writing in ways that feel both fresh and deeply expanding. This book is an illuminating guide to understanding how best to read, understand, and admire one of American literature\u2019s greatest voices.\"",
      "\"Lost Lambs\" by Madeline Cash",
      "Isaac says: \"'Lost Lambs' is an incredibly tender \u2014 yet also hilarious \u2014 debut. Madeline Cash explores adolescence, faith, family, and power through the lens of a tightly controlled religious community, where devotion and vulnerability exist side by side. With wildly inventive writing, Lost Lambs captures moral uncertainty and emotional awakening with remarkable precision. This novel marks the emergence of an incredible new talent in Madeline Cash.\"",
      "\"Mei Mei The Bunny\" by Laufey",
      "Isaac says: \"'Mei Mei the Bunny' is a gentle, charming children\u2019s book about a shy but curious bunny learning how to be brave, kind, and true to herself. Alongside beautiful illustrations by Lauren O\u2019Hara, Laufey\u2019s tender story offers a comforting message about growth, empathy, and finding joy in small moments. A great read aloud to return to again and again with the young ones in your life.\"",
      "Adriana Trigiani's picks",
      "\"Skylark\" by Paula McLain",
      "Adriana says: \"Paula McLain returns to Paris in this page-turning tale that goes between Alouette Voland\u2019s quest for artistic freedom in 1664 and Dr. Kristof Larson\u2019s dangerous mission during German occupation in 1939. Paula is one of our great American novelists, and 'Skylark' might be her best yet.\"",
      "\"Work in Progress\" by James Martin, SJ",
      "Adriana says: \"In Father James Martin\u2019s forthcoming memoir, 'Work in Progress,' we really get to know the beloved priest and his journey to becoming a leader in the Catholic Church. This is a coming-of-age story perfect for all readers of all faiths: relatable, readable, and full of wisdom.\"",
      "\"Keeper of Lost Children\" by Sadeqa Johnson",
      "Adriana says: \"Sadeqa Johnson is the master of historical fiction and 'Keeper of the Lost Children' does not disappoint. Set in post-WWII Germany, this novel visits an orphanage filled with the abandoned mixed-race children of German women and Black American GI\u2019s. This is an unknown history about love, resilience and identity.\"",
      "\"One Whole Hippopotamus\" by Carter Higgins",
      "Adriana says: \"'One Whole Hippopotamus' is an adorable introduction to early learning for our smallest readers. Acclaimed author Carter Higgins gives us an interactive and vibrant book perfect for teachers, librarians and parents to share with their little ones.\""

      "In a private phone call a week ago, Trump told Nicol\u00e1s Maduro that he had to go.",
      "By that point, an armada of U.S. warships was floating off Venezuela\u2019s shores. A CIA team had crept into the country, tracking Maduro\u2019s movements and habits: where he slept, what he ate, where he traveled.",
      "\u201cYou got to surrender,\u201d Trump said, recalling the conversation at a news conference Saturday at his Mar-a-Lago home.",
      "Maduro took the gamble of his life. He \u201ccame close\u201d to giving in, Trump said, but stayed put.",
      "That act of defiance set in motion the final phase of a secret and risky plan to evict Maduro by force. At 10:46 p.m. ET Friday, Trump gave the final order to launch.",
      "This account of \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve,\u201d the most audacious military action in either of Trump\u2019s terms, is based on interviews with more than a dozen White House, administration and congressional officials, as well as public statements.",
      "As early as August, the CIA quietly sent a small unit into Venezuela with the goal of providing \u201cextraordinary insight\u201d into Maduro\u2019s movements, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Even his pets were known to U.S. intelligence agents, Dan \u201cRaizin\u201d Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the news conference Saturday.",
      "Elite troops trained for months, going so far as to use a replica of the presidential compound based on intelligence that the U.S. had gathered, Trump said in an interview with Fox News \u2014 the same way the troops who killed Osama bin Laden practiced in 2011 with a model of his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. They trained with what Trump called \u201cmassive blowtorches\u201d in case they had to cut through steel walls in Maduro\u2019s safe room.",
      "At the same time, a core Trump administration team worked privately on the project for months, holding regular meetings and phone calls and briefing Trump, a person knowledgeable about the matter said.",
      "That group consisted of some of the people Trump said will now be running Venezuela, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, the person said.",
      "Throughout the fall, Trump steadily amped up the pressure on Maduro. In September, the Trump administration began sinking boats in the Caribbean that it alleged were sending drugs to the U.S. Experts said, however, that the boats were shipping cocaine to Europe. All told, the administration has struck at least 35 alleged drug vessels so far, killing 114 people.",
      "The rationale for the boat strikes shifted over time. Was it drugs Trump wanted to destroy, or the Maduro regime? In an interview she gave Vanity Fair in November, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said the purpose was to attack the boats until Maduro \u201ccries uncle.\u201d",
      "She also said in the interview that an attack on the Venezuela mainland would require congressional approval \u2014 something the White House hasn\u2019t gotten.",
      "\u201cIf he were to authorize some activity on land, then it\u2019s war, then [we\u2019d need] Congress,\u201d Wiles told the author, Chris Whipple.",
      "The same month, America\u2019s most advanced aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, swept into the Caribbean, part of a military buildup that Trump believed got the attention of Maduro.",
      "\u201cA lot of ships out there,\u201d Trump said at the news conference.",
      "Trump left the White House for the holidays on Dec. 19, with Mar-a-Lago serving as his headquarters for the final planning. He approved the operation before Christmas, though the exact day was uncertain, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the planning.",
      "Venezuela wasn\u2019t his only worry. On Christmas Day, he announced he had ordered strikes on militants in Nigeria in response to alleged persecution of Christians.",
      "At a New Year\u2019s Eve party at his home, dressed in a tuxedo with first lady Melania Trump at his side, Trump was asked by reporters about his resolution for 2026.",
      "\u201cPeace on Earth,\u201d he said.",
      "So secret was the Venezuela assault that even the precise timing wasn\u2019t widely known at the Pentagon until Friday night, two U.S. officials told NBC News. Typically, the timing of such a military operation would have wider coordination.",
      "Vice President JD Vance went to Trump\u2019s golf club in West Palm Beach and met with him during the day Friday to discuss the strikes. But he left before the attack started, in deference to concerns that a late-night motorcade movement might tip off the Venezuelans about the coming raid, a Vance spokesperson said.",
      "Wind and cloud cover in Caracas had delayed the attack for days, but Friday, the weather broke. The moon was full, and the skies had mostly cleared \u2014 acceptable conditions for the pilots and crews.",
      "The mission was on.",
      "\u201cGood luck and Godspeed,\u201d Trump told military leaders, words they transmitted down the chain, Caine said.",
      "Trump spent much of the night and early morning at his home watching the attack play out. A picture released by the White House shows him sitting at a table, fingers interlocked, wearing a jacket but not his customary tie, staring intently at what presumably was a video screen out of the frame. Standing to his left is Rubio; to his right, Ratcliffe. Miller is seated, arms crossed. Congress wouldn\u2019t be notified until the attack was underway. Trump said Saturday he didn\u2019t want lawmakers to leak details.",
      "At least 150 aircraft flew toward Caracas from 20 different bases on land and sea. The fleet included bombers, fighters and craft that specialized in intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance, Caine said. The crews ranged in age from 20 to 49.",
      "Darkness cloaked the Venezuelan capital. Trump suggested that the U.S. had cut the electricity in Caracas to gain an edge in the battle. Flying at 100 feet above the water, helicopters carried the special forces and law enforcement officials who plucked Maduro from his residence, Caine said. Other aircraft fired weapons to disable Venezuela\u2019s air defense systems and clear a path for the helicopters, he added.",
      "Flames were seen billowing from explosions at Fort Tiuna, a large military complex in Caracas.",
      "By 1 a.m. ET Saturday, U.S. soldiers had reached the compound in Caracas where Maduro was staying. \u201cA heavily fortified military fortress,\u201d Trump called it.",
      "When Delta Force breached Maduro\u2019s residence, he and his wife were taken \u201ccompletely by surprise,\u201d Caine said. Maduro tried to escape into what Trump described as a steel safe room but didn\u2019t make it in time. The forces took Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, into custody.",
      "A firefight broke out after Maduro was captured, Caine said, and a U.S. helicopter was hit. No Americans were killed, though there were several injuries to U.S. troops, all of whom are stable, according to a U.S. official and a White House official.",
      "By 3:30 a.m. ET, U.S. forces were safely out of the country, Caine said. At that time, the air in Caracas smelled of gunpowder and smoke. The U.S. Embassy in Venezuela cautioned American citizens there to shelter in place.",
      "Less than an hour later, Trump broke the news to the world on social media.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America has successfully carried out a large scale strike against Venezuela and its leader, President Nicolas Maduro, who has been, along with his wife, captured and flown out of the Country,\u201d he wrote.",
      "A picture the White House posted Saturday morning showed Maduro aboard the USS Iwo Jima assault ship in a sweatsuit, handcuffed and blindfolded.",
      "By 4:30 p.m. ET, Maduro was in New York. He arrived at Stewart Airport in New Windsor north of New York City. Dozens of law enforcement officers flanked Maduro as he shuffled to the hangar. He and his wife were to be transported to a jail in New York City later in the day. On Monday, Maduro is expected to make his first court appearance.",
      "He and his alleged co-conspirators face prosecution for a scheme in which a \u201ccycle of narcotics-based corruption lines the pockets of Venezuelan officials and their families while also benefiting violent narco-terrorists who operate with impunity on Venezuelan soil and who help produce, protect, and transport tons of cocaine to the United States,\" the indictment alleges.",
      "Following the strike, Trump made it clear that \u201cOperation Absolute Resolve\u201d wasn\u2019t a one-off. Nor was it solely about apprehending someone the U.S. considers a fugitive. The military campaign amounts to a dramatic escalation of presidential authority, with Trump attempting to mold the hemisphere to a revised version of \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy.",
      "In a twist on the 19th century Monroe Doctrine, which asserted a distinct sphere of influence for the young American nation, Trump is demonstrating that he\u2019ll use hard power to promote U.S. interests and create advantageous conditions for business.",
      "\u201cThe Donroe Doctrine,\u201d Trump called it.",

      "The Artemis II mission, the next step in NASA\u2019s return-to-the-moon program, is expected to launch sometime from February to April. The flight will be a key test of NASA\u2019s Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. The mission will send four astronauts on a roughly 10-day journey around the moon to evaluate how the Orion spacecraft\u2019s various systems and hardware function in a deep space environment.",
      "The mission will be the first crewed flight of the Artemis program, and it will take the astronauts to the closest point humans have come to the moon in more than 50 years, since the end of the Apollo program.",
      "It will be closely watched, particularly as the Trump administration has repeatedly talked about the need to return to the moon before China lands its astronauts on the lunar surface. Much of that vision hinges on the outcome of the Artemis II mission.",
      "If it succeeds, the flight will pave the way for the Artemis III mission, which is expected to land astronauts near the moon\u2019s south pole. In a recent executive order, President Donald Trump directed NASA to return astronauts to the moon by 2028 \u201cto assert American leadership in space, lay the foundations for lunar economic development, prepare for the journey to Mars, and inspire the next generation of American explorers.\u201d",

      "In January 2025, Trump issued an executive order to plan events to mark the anniversary. He later announced Freedom 250, a nonpartisan initiative launched at his direction to plan additional celebratory events. Those events kicked off on New Year\u2019s Eve with the Washington Monument being transformed into the \u201cworld\u2019s tallest birthday candle\u201d by projections being displayed nightly through Jan. 5.",

      "Republicans are defending a narrow majority in the House \u2014 Democrats need to net just three seats to take back control (a task that could be complicated by the ongoing redistricting wildfire that has swept state legislatures across the country). The GOP\u2019s defense of its Senate majority is likely to be easier, as Democrats need to net four more seats there, and most of that battlefield runs through states Trump won in 2024.",
      "There will also be major governor\u2019s races in key swing states like Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin; legislative races that could determine control of legislatures across the country; and mayoral races in cities like Los Angeles and Washington, D.C."

      "Widespread protests have rocked Iran for nearly a week and led to increasing violent clashes with security forces, prompting President Donald Trump to threaten intervention if a crackdown continues.",
      "The protests, which started with economic grievances by shopkeepers in Tehran and quickly spread to remote cities in provinces like Fars and Lorestan, where protesters chanted slogans against the ruling clerics, have raised pointed questions for the country\u2019s leaders about how much support they really enjoy.",
      "Ali Larijani, who serves as the secretary of Iran\u2019s Supreme National Security Council, alleged Friday without providing evidence that Israel and the U.S. were stoking the escalating demonstrations. And Iranian Parliament Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said in a post on X that Trump\u2019s threat of intervention makes U.S. bases in the region \u201clegitimate targets.\u201d",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Trump had said that if Iran \u201cviolently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue.\u201d He did not specify what this would mean.",
      "Iranian officials attempted to project a united front with ordinary citizens in June, when the Israeli military battered the country in a 12-day war, partly joined by the U.S. military. The war killed more than 1,000 people including top military leaders and nuclear scientists, according to state media, and wreaked havoc on its nuclear facilities.",
      "On Monday, after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump issued a fresh threat to \u201cknock the hell out of\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic attempts to rebuild its nuclear program or expand its ballistic missile program.",
      "Saturday\u2019s capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who enjoyed a warm relationship with Tehran, has also incensed Iran\u2019s political elites, who have decried the U.S. operation as \u201ca clear example of state terrorism.\u201d But as tensions with the U.S. escalate once again, Iran appears far from having the unity projected last year.",
      "\u201cIranians were facing bombardment by external powers and so they had no choice but to stick together. And I think that we should take that for what it was. Did [Iranians] coming together mean that they suddenly abandoned all of their contentious feelings towards the regime or its leadership? Absolutely not. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive feelings,\u201d Sanam Vakil, director of the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cAnd I think that Iranians still feel quite united amidst the many challenges that they face, challenges from abroad, challenges from their governance system and their leadership that isn\u2019t willing to reform or change,\u201d Vakil said,",
      "Even before the joint Israeli and U.S. attack in June, Iran\u2019s economy was in a tailspin, battered by sanctions, rising inflation and the devaluation of the Iranian currency against the U.S. dollar, which led to families struggling hard to make ends meet as the value of their savings plunged, analysts say.",
      "The country\u2019s problems were compounded by a water and energy crisis last year that led to dry taps and electricity blackouts.",
      "President Masoud Pezeshkian has attempted to at least partly shoulder the blame for the country\u2019s woes and even suggested on Monday that the interior minister should meet with leaders among the protesters to address their concerns and try to solve their problems.",
      "\u201cIf the people are dissatisfied, we and you are to blame. Don\u2019t look for America or someone else to blame,\u201d Pezeshkian said on Thursday while visiting officials in the province of Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari in central Iran, according to state media. \u201cWe need to serve properly so the people are satisfied with us.\u201d",
      "The Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, a Norwegian-registered Kurdish watchdog that monitors rights violations across Iran, reported on Thursday that two protesters were killed by security forces in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari, perhaps highlighting the limits of Pezeshkian\u2019s powers in dealing with the protests.",
      "\u201cHe is trying to limit, I think, the nature of the anger. He\u2019s trying to say it\u2019s all because of the currency collapse, because of inflation,\u201d Abbas Milani, the director of the Iranian studies program at Stanford University, told NBC News in a telephone interview.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think that people see it that way. I think the people see the currency collapse and the inflation as the consequence of the regime\u2019s inherent corruption and incapacity,\u201d Milani said. \u201cThey want the regime changed.\u201d",
      "Hengaw reported the death of 10 people during six days of protests, including one man who was killed by security forces on Friday in Kermanshah province in northwest Iran.",
      "It remains to be seen whether Trump\u2019s threats of intervention will encourage the protesters or lead security forces to hold their fire.",
      "\u201cPeople could feel slightly more confident and emboldened thinking that the United States might actually be more than rhetorically supportive,\u201d said Vakil of Chatham House. \u201cBut I worry that they might be disappointed, not understanding that the United States is very much focused on outcomes and interests that benefit the United States and not really benevolent towards the Iranian people.\u201d",
      "Still, whether the protests expand and continue or are crushed by force like similar protests in 2022 and 2023 \u2014 when approximately 500 people were killed and thousands were arrested \u2014 will largely depend on the will of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, analysts say. He has not spoken publicly about the protests in the past week.",
      "\u201cThey will have a scorched-earth policy,\u201d Milani from Stanford said."

      "Even major European allies, more cautious and measured in tone, carefully signaled concern about the operation\u2019s legality while largely aligning with the U.S. on policy.",
      "Taken together, these responses suggest the revival of old fears of American interventionism, prompting allies and adversaries alike to ponder where Washington might act next.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is fulfilling his campaign promise to \"demolish foreign drug cartels\" by going after Maduro. She said on X that the operation would \"keep our citizens safe\" in keeping with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda.",
      "For Tehran, the fall of a close ally comes as it grapples with internal unrest of its own, just a day after Trump warned Iran it could face U.S. action if protesters were harmed.",

      "Asked during an interview with NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press\u201d whether the Trump administration\u2019s next target is the Cuban government, Rubio said, \u201cThe Cuban government is a huge problem.\u201d",
      "He said: \u201cI\u2019m not going to talk to you about what our future steps are going to be and our policies are going to be right now in this regard. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any mystery that we are not big fans of the Cuban regime.\u201d",

      "French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot said the military operation in Venezuela \u201ccontravenes the principle of non-use of force, which underpins international law,\u201d while Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said it violated international law.",
      "But as reactions to the Venezuela strike largely fell along predictable lines, the precedent it sets has left others wondering how vulnerable they might be, said H.A. Hellyer, a senior associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank in London.",
      "\u201cEuropean countries were counting on the U.S. and certain types of U.S. behavior that perhaps they can\u2019t do anymore,\u201d he told NBC News, noting that Denmark had been careful in its response because \u201cthey know that Greenland is in the firing line.\u201d",
      "Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of buying or taking Greenland, treating it as a strategic asset for the U.S. in the Arctic.",
      "Denmark\u2019s ambassador to Washington, Jesper M\u00f8ller S\u00f8rensen, shared what he said was a \u201cfriendly reminder\u201d on X Saturday that \u201cwe expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,\u201d pushing back at Trump-aligned figures who had raised the issue in the wake of the Venezuela strike.",
      "Many of the reactions to the Venezuela strike, Hellyer noted, \u201chave very little to do with Maduro and have everything to do with, you know, lining up with the U.S. on a particular issue.\u201d Europe, he said, was \u201cexpressing support for international law, but without wanting to be identified as opposing the U.S.,\u201d raising the question: \u201cWhat\u2019s the point of invoking a system that isn\u2019t backed by the strongest power in the world?\u201d",
      "But recent history shows that even as the rules-based order struggles, the U.S. has frequently acted unilaterally, with the Venezuela strike reflecting enduring patterns of intervention in Latin America, according to retired Col. Gregory A. Daddis.",
      "\u201cIn many ways, U.S. actions in Venezuela follow a long history of American interventionism in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, \u201cwhere we have argued that the Western Hemisphere, in its entirety, falls within our jurisdiction to protect U.S. interests.\u201d"

      "Mehari said a thick smoke enveloped the venue and the crowd, blinding him. He fell to the ground as people rushed to escape the bar, he said, but a man pulled him away to safety.",
      "His friends were not so lucky, he says. \u201cI have four friends who died,\u201d he said, still struggling to process the loss. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s not real.\u201d",
      "Mehari, who has lived in the area for 15 years, said he saw someone he knew from school disfigured and burning, and others whose hair and clothes had burned off.",
      "\u201cSomebody was dying in front of me and I couldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d he said. \u201cHer face was so burned it was red.\u201d",

      "Mehari was among survivors taken to a hospital ward in Sion, where he was offered mental health assistance. \u201cI tried to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d he said.",
      "Mehari\u2019s was among the harrowing witness accounts emerging Friday as investigators searched for answers. At least 40 people are dead and 119 injured, officials said, many of them with serious burns that a senior doctor treating them said will require \u201cmonths of rehabilitation\u201d and even have \u201clifelong consequences.\u201d",
      "Axel Clavier, 16, from Paris, told The Associated Press that he lost his jacket, shoes and phone while fleeing, though he was grateful to have made it out. \u201cI am still alive and it\u2019s just stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m still in shock.\u201d",

      "Laetitia Place, 17, said she was caught up in the chaos.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s the small door where everyone was pushing, and so we all fell, we were piled on top of each other, some people were burning, and some were dead next to us,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cI was so scared \u2014 scared for myself, scared for my friends, scared for everyone inside.\u201d",

      "The injured were teenagers and young adults, roughly 20 years old on average, he told The Associated Press inside the hospital.",
      "Injured survivors suffered burns to varying degrees, not just to their skin but also to their airways.",
      "\u201cThere were inhalations of both smoke and also of heat that for some probably led to internal burns. That\u2019s a really catastrophic situation, as you can imagine,\u201d Bonvin said.",
      "\u201cIt was hard to live through for everyone. Also probably because everyone was asking themselves, \u2018Was my child, my cousin, someone from the region at this party?\u2019 This place was very well known as somewhere to celebrate the new year,\u201d Bonvin said. \u201cAlso, seeing young people arrive \u2014 that\u2019s always traumatic.\u201d",

      "Senior Iranian officials fired back, warning that U.S. intervention would spark regional chaos and make American forces in the Middle East \"legitimate targets.\"",
      "It comes after protests in the Islamic Republic took a sharply violent turn in recent days, with at least seven deaths reported by a human rights organization and at least three reported by a semiofficial news agency.",
      "The protests erupted Sunday in the capital, Tehran, with crowds largely chanting about economic grievances after the country's currency hit a record low against the dollar as prices soar.",
      "People have since taken to the streets in smaller cities, and the protests have taken a more political bent with slogans targeting the clerical regime and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country's highest authority.",

A water crisis also led to taps running dry at times late last year.",

      "The fire, which broke out around 1:30 a.m. (7:30 p.m. ET Wednesday) at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland and left 40 dead, appears to have started when sparklers atop bottles were brought too close to the ceiling, Beatrice Pilloud, the Valais canton Attorney General, told a news conference Friday after preliminary investigations.",
      "The sparklers appear to have led to \u201cwhat is referred to as a flashover incident where the fire spread very rapidly,\u201d she said. Investigators would assess soundproofing foam used in the ceiling, and whether anyone needs to be held criminally liable for the fire, she added.",

The nationality is unknown for 14 of those injured.",

      "Geneva University Hospitals said it was treating five people. Most patients were young, between 15 and 30 years old, said Dr. Robert Larribau, the chief physician at the hospitals' emergency department.",
      "He told NBC News that many of them had \"serious injuries\" that appeared to have been caused by the twin phenomena of \"backdraft\" and \"flashover.\"",
      "Backdraft is when new air comes into contact with a fire that has used up all the available oxygen. This can lead \"to immediate fatal injuries, including severe blast trauma, extensive thermal damage, and lethal inhalation of toxic gases,\" Larribau said, \"and is therefore more commonly observed among nonsurvivors rather than among rescued victims.\"",
      "Flashover occurs when all flammable materials in an enclosed space ignite simultaneously, causing \"severe, often deep, burns predominantly affecting exposed body areas such as the face, neck, and upper limbs, and is frequently associated with critical inhalation injury due to intense radiant heat and superheated gases,\" he said.",
      "\"For those who survive, there will be weeks or even months of rehabilitation, and many will suffer lifelong consequences,\" he added.",
      "Authorities said they had ruled out terrorism, saying that an explosion at the venue was caused by the fire, rather than the other way round.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine \u2014 Russia rang in the new year by launching more than 200 drones at Ukraine, while President Vladimir Putin used his year-end address to rally support for his troops and to assure his nation of victory.",
      "In Ukraine itself, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s Dec. 31 address was defiant but also optimistic about the frenetic shuttle diplomacy being brokered by the United States.",
      "Zelenskyy said that Russia, whose officials are also in talks with the Americans, remains the central barrier to peace, with Putin unyielding in his maximalist demands.",
      "\u201cI would give anything in the world if, in this address, I could say that peace will also come in just a few minutes,\u201d Zelenskyy said just before the clock struck midnight. \u201cUnfortunately, I cannot say that yet. But with a clear conscience, I \u2014 all of us \u2014 can say that Ukraine is truly doing everything for peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader recently returned from a meeting with President Donald Trump in Florida on Sunday. Afterward, Zelenskyy said Trump had offered 15 years of the crucial \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d that he says are essential to stop Putin from attacking again. Ukraine had asked for 50 years, he said.",
      "Hours before the new year\u2019s bells chimed, Trump\u2019s special envoy Steve Witkoff posted on X that he had held a call with Zelenskyy, Ukrainian national security secretary Rustem Umerov and the national security advisers of Britain, France and Germany.",
      "In his own post on X, Umerov said Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Trump\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner were also on the call.",
      "Though Zelenskyy said that the \u201cpeace agreement is 90% ready,\u201d he suggested that the remaining 10% contained the thorniest issues preventing peace.",
      "\u201cThose are the 10% that will determine the fate of peace, the fate of Ukraine and Europe, how people will live,\u201d he said. \u201cTen percent to save millions of lives. Ten percent of the determination needed for peace to work 100%. Ten percent of the unity and wisdom so desperately needed \u2014 Ukrainian, American, European, from the entire world. Ten percent to peace.\u201d",
      "The Ukrainian leader charted what has been a roller-coaster year trying to retain the goodwill of Trump, a pivotal and changeable figure in the peace process. Zelenskyy said \u201cit was not easy at all to achieve such a change in the tone of relations between Ukraine and the United States\u201d after he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance in an extraordinary White House meeting in February.",
      "Trump has often shifted between appearing to favor Russia and then Ukraine during these negotiations, and has at various points been criticized for freezing Ukraine and Europe out of the process.",
      "\u201cWithout Ukraine, nothing will work. Ukraine has defended its right to have a voice,\u201d Zelenskyy said, adding later: \u201cUkraine is, in fact, the only shield that now separates Europe\u2019s comfortable way of life from the Russian world.\u201d",
      "Hours after Zelenskyy spoke, Russia launched 205 drones \u2014 mostly Iran-designed Shaheds along with some Russian Gerbera drones \u2014 into Ukraine, according to the country\u2019s military. Air defense systems downed 176 of these, but 24 strikes were recorded at 15 locations, it said. There was also shelling right along the line of contact between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "At least two people were killed and more than a dozen injured across the country, according to regional officials.",
      "For its part, Ukraine launched a strike against Russia\u2019s Rosrezerv oil depot in the Yaroslavl region, the Security Service of Ukraine, the SBU, said in a statement. The SBU said this was the latest strike designed to \u201ccut off the supply chains of Russian petroleum products with surgical precision, both abroad and for the troops attacking Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Russia claimed this week that Ukraine had attempted to assassinate Putin with a drone strike on his country residence, something that Ukraine denied and the CIA concluded was not true, a source with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",
      "In his own New Year\u2019s address, Putin said his country was striving \u201cto bring joy and warmth\u201d to those in need, as well as the \u201cheroes\u201d fighting in Ukraine. \u201cI wish all our soldiers and commanders a happy new year! We believe in you and in our victory,\u201d he said.",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv and Alexander Smith from London."

She said local residents asked them for help, for a doctor to check on the hearing problems and for new fishing nets and hammocks, which had also been blown up.",
