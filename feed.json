      "It\u2019s oddly comforting that a movie can still dial M when it wants to.",
      "Smart phones have largely been a bit of a buzzkill for horror films, leading filmmakers to find all kinds of reasons \u2014 dead batteries, no service \u2014 to strand potential prey. But at least since 1949\u2019s \u201cSorry, Wrong Number,\u201d phones have also been a reliable conduit for terror capable of reaching into the home, or your pocket. \u201cDrop,\u201d a silly but suspenseful new thriller, carries on the tradition of \u201cWhen a Stranger Calls\" and \u201cPhone Booth\u201d by situating its tension around mysterious, threatening phone messages.",
      "Violet ( Meghann Fahy ), a widow with a young child, is on her first date in years. After three months of texting, she has hesitantly agreed to finally meet Henry (Brandon Sklenar) for dinner. When they sit down in a fancy restaurant high up a sleek Chicago high-rise, he\u2019s charming and relaxed. But Violet, like countless dates before her, can\u2019t stay off her phone.",
      "In Violet\u2019s case, though, the distraction is legitimate. She keeps getting messages dropped to her phone threatening her son, who\u2019s at home with Violet\u2019s sister (Violett Beane), unless she does what he says, including killing her date. In her home security cameras she can see a man with his face covered brandishing a gun.",
      "\u201cDrop,\u201d directed by Christopher Landon (\u201cHappy Death Day\u201d), doesn\u2019t differ greatly from the large swath of high-concept, low-budget thrillers that regularly flood theaters. But it\u2019s a taut little movie, almost totally set in the restaurant, with a just keen enough sense of plausible and preposterous. It knows to keep the pressure-cooker plot moving while not overstaying its welcome. At a nifty 95 minutes, \u201cDrop\u201d knows when to hang up.",
      "As if adding a digital twist to the old line \u201cThe call is coming from inside the house,\u201d Violet is getting message from an app called DigiDrop that can only be sent from a person within 50 feet. That means everyone in the restaurant \u2014 the bro who bumps into her, the cheesy waiter, the kind bartender \u2014 is a suspect. With her terrorizer watching her every move and prohibiting her from breathing a word to anyone, Violet is stuck rooted to her table when every fiber of her being wants to rescue her son.",
      "A considerable help to the film are the grounded screen presences of Fahy (\u201cThe White Lotus\u201d) and Sklenar (\u201c1923\u201d), both small-screen breakouts who here show movie-star poise. As the plot unspools, there are, naturally, quibbles one could make. Would a mother, with a masked gunman outside her toddler\u2019s door be able to feign interest in a duck salad? Does the highly orchestrated trap laid for her match the motives of the criminal mastermind? And while we're asking questions, could we not someday get a phone-themed thriller titled \u201cButt Dial\u201d?",
      "But if \u201cDrop\u201d is invariably quite a bit less than realistic, it has a whiff of metaphor. Violet isn\u2019t just stepping back into the dating pool as a single mom, she\u2019s trying to shake the past trauma of spousal abuse. Going on a date with Henry, whom she met on an app, is a kind of crap shoot. Will going out with a stranger met online end in love or violence?",
      "You could also read \u201cDrop\u201d as an extreme version of a more ubiquitous scourge. This is a movie where the bad guy, for nearly the duration of the movie, is nothing but text messages. (They are typically flashed large across the screen.) As Violet grows increasingly preoccupied and frantic, she could be just about anyone \u2014 a workaholic after hours, a teenager, a desperate Knicks fan watching the score \u2014 whose attention is held prisoner by her phone. How much of the terror of \u201cDrop\u201d would have existed at all, if she had just put it on silent?",
      "\"Drop,\u201d a Universal Pictures release is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for strong violent content, suicide, some strong language and sexual references. Running time: 95 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "Levy died Monday in Los Angeles surrounded by loved ones, representatives for Amblin Entertainment said Wednesday. No cause was given.",
      "\u201cMarvin\u2019s passing is a huge loss for me and our industry writ large. There are many talented PR executives, but Marvin was one of a kind,\u201d Spielberg said in a statement. \u201cI am grateful for all our years together. Marvin never failed to make me laugh, he never stopped smiling. We will miss you Marvin. You will always be in our hearts and your memory will always make us smile.\u201d",
      "Levy's long-standing partnership with Spielberg made him one of the most renowned and respected publicists in Hollywood. Over his 70-year career, he worked on campaigns for film classics like \u201cTaxi Driver,\u201d \u201cKramer vs. Kramer,\u201d \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\" \u201cJurassic Park\" and \"Gladiator.\"",
      "In 2018, Levy, a long-standing member of the film academy's public relations branch, became the first and only publicist to receive an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. No publicist\u2019s name had even been put forth for the award before Levy's.",
      "\u201cIt was way out of left field for me. I couldn\u2019t have imagined it,\u201d Levy told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I could say \u2018Gee, I\u2019d love to get that one day.\u2019 It was not on my to-do list.\u201d",
      "Born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1928, Levy was raised on the east side and attended New York University. Though he never set out to be a publicist specifically, he knew he had a way with words. One of his first jobs was writing questions for a TV quiz show. But he was fired when his \u201cbig ticket\u201d question was answered too early in the season.",
      "His first publicity job was at MGM in New York, where he was so far down on the ladder that he never got to travel to Los Angeles, but where he worked on campaigns for films like \u201cGigi\u201d and \u201cBen-Hur.\u201d By the time the company was remaking \u201cMutiny on the Bounty,\" he knew it was time to move on.",
      "Levy soon found his way to legendary publicists Arthur Canton and Bill Blowitz, and then Columbia Pictures which took him to California. It was during that time that he first started working with Spielberg who was fresh off \u201cJaws.\u201d He was told he was only to concentrate on \u201cClose Encounters.\" By 1982, he went full time with Spielberg and wouldn\u2019t look back.",
      "While he had many highs in the industry, Levy also recalled a big heartbreak when \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d lost the best picture trophy to \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d at the 71st Academy Awards.",
      "\u201cThat was the toughest night of my life in terms of the business,\u201d Levy said. But he put on a brave face at the Governor's Ball following the ceremony.",
      "Tom Hanks presented the honorary Oscar to Levy in 2018, noting that it takes, \u201cSomething of a storyteller to get an audience hooked on the story without giving away the story.\u201d",
      "Levy remained devoted to Spielberg, and Amblin Entertainment, up to his full retirement in 2024. For him, it never got old.",
      "\u201cHow lucky can you be? I mean it,\u201d he said in 2018. \u201cWe work for the best filmmaker around.\u201d",
      "Levy is survived by his wife of 73 years, Carol, their two sons, Don and Doug, and two grandsons, Brian and Daniel.",

      "NEW YORK -- As springtime sunshine finally hits New York City, the Met Gala beckons \u2014 one of the most anticipated and visible parties in the world.",
      "This year, the theme \u2014 \u201cTailored For You\" \u2014 is focused on classic tailoring. As always, the dress code is inspired by the spring exhibit at the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. \u201cSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style\u201d is the first Met show to focus exclusively on Black designers, and the first in more than 20 years to have a menswear theme. The show looks at the evolution of Black style over the centuries through the lens of dandyism.",
      "Here are some key things to know as fashion's biggest night approaches:",
      "The gala happens the first Monday in May \u2014 this year, May 5.",
      "Not everyone knows that the gala is actually a fundraiser for the Costume Institute, the only self-funding department at the Met. Last year the evening brought in a whopping sum of more than $26 million to the museum's coffers.",
      "Definitely not. It started in 1948 as a Manhattan society midnight supper \u2013 held at various places like the Waldorf Astoria and the Rainbow Room. It took many years before it turned into a global event and one of the starriest nights of the year.",
      "Each year brings a new group of celebrity co-chairs. This year they are Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, and A$AP Rocky \u2014 along with Anna Wintour, the influential Vogue editor who always oversees the proceedings. NBA superstar LeBron James is honorary chair.",
      "Word on attendees trickles out slowly in the weeks leading up to the event. But this year there\u2019s also a huge additional host committee with stars from various fields. (They don\u2019t have specific host duties, other than showing up and, it goes without saying, looking fabulous.)",
      "It includes athletes Simone Biles and husband Jonathan Owens, Angel Reese and Sha\u2019Carri Richardson; filmmakers Spike Lee, Tonya Lewis Lee and Regina King; and actors Ayo Edebiri, Audra McDonald and Jeremy Pope, and musicians Doechii, Usher, Tyla, Janelle Mon\u00e1e and Andr\u00e9 3000.",
      "Also in the group are author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie; artists Jordan Casteel, Rashid Johnson and Kara Walker; playwrights Jeremy O. Harris and Branden Jacobs-Jenkins; and fashion figures Grace Wales Bonner, Edward Enninful, Dapper Dan and Olivier Rousteing.",
      "The code is meant to be a guide, not a hard rule, and loose interpretation is encouraged. Sometimes, that interpretation extends not only to what guests put on, but what they take off. Lady Gaga did a 16-minute striptease on the gala carpet in 2019. Jared Leto spent the evening in 2023 carrying around his huge cat head, a tribute to Karl Lagerfeld's beloved pet.",
      "Guests enter the museum and walk past an enormous flower arrangement in the museum\u2019s grand lobby \u2013 always a talking point. Often there is an an orchestra playing nearby. At the top of the grand staircase, Wintour and her co-hosts form a receiving line. Guests then head either to cocktails or to view the exhibit. Cocktails are followed by dinner. The most hotly anticipated guests sometimes skip cocktails and even dinner, and arrive around dessert time for maximum impact (we're looking at you, Rihanna).",

      "The band recorded its first album in 1976 and by the following year was touring with such icons as Iggy Pop and David Bowie. It became known as the most commercially successful band to emerge from a fertile New York rock scene that also produced Talking Heads and the Ramones.",

There\u2019s also a five-track 1975 album demo that includes \u201cPlatinum Blonde,\u201d a sort of band mission statement. But Burke\u2019s mark was especially solidified with his rapid, powerful drumming at the start of \u201cDreaming\u201d in 1979.",
      "In 2022, after unearthing a New Wave treasure trove of reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes and records, the band created the box set \u201cBlondie: Against the Odds, 1974-1982,\u201d with 124 tracks and 36 previously unissued recordings, demos, outtakes and remixed versions of Blondie\u2019s initial six studio albums.",
      "Burke reflected on the discovery in an Associated Press article: \u201cWe never would have thought that we would still be here today. Looking back at our archives, it\u2019s pretty amazing.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame described Burke in a post Monday on the social platform X as \u201ca versatile and distinctive drummer who played exactly what each song required \u2013 and, when called for, let loose with blistering punk rock energy.\u201d",

      "Craig Mueller, Chasing Horse's lawyer, said in a motion filed Friday that he needs more time to prepare and interview witnesses. It's the latest in a series of delays since Chasing Horse was arrested and indicted in early 2023.",
      "Chasing Horse has pleaded not guilty to 21 felonies, including sexual assault of a minor under 16, kidnapping and producing and possessing videos of child sexual abuse. If convicted of the sexual assault charges, he could face decades or life in prison.",
      "After starring as Smiles A Lot in the 1990 Oscar-winning film \u201cDances with Wolves,\u201d Chasing Horse began promoting himself as a self-proclaimed Lakota medicine man while traveling around North America to perform healing ceremonies, authorities have said. He was born on the Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, home to the Sicangu Sioux, one of the seven tribes of the Lakota nation.",
      "Prosecutors say Chasing Horse used his position to gain access to vulnerable women and girls for decades until his arrest near Las Vegas. He has been jailed ever since, but criminal proceedings were at a standstill for more than a year while Chasing Horse challenged his original indictment.",
      "It was eventually dismissed after the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that prosecutors had abused the grand jury process when they provided a definition of grooming as evidence without any expert testimony. The high court's order, however, left open the possibility for charges to be refiled, and prosecutors quickly took their case before another grand jury.",
      "Chasing Horse was again indicted in October. The indictment added new allegations that he filmed himself having sex with one of his accusers when she was younger than 14. Prosecutors have said the footage, taken in 2010 or 2011, was found on cellphones in a locked safe inside the North Las Vegas home that Chasing Horse is said to have shared with five wives, including the girl in the videos.",
      "His case has been unfolding at the same time lawmakers and prosecutors around the U.S. are funneling more resources into cases involving Native women, including human trafficking and killings.",

      "NEW YORK -- Comic Amber Ruffin has a new spring gig.",
      "PEN America told The Associated Press on Monday that Ruffin will host the free expression organization's gala fundraiser on May 15. The comic had been scheduled as a featured speaker April 26 at the White House Correspondents Association' s annual dinner. But the WHCA rescinded the offer to Ruffin, a blunt critic of President Donald Trump, saying it wanted to focus on journalistic achievement.",
      "In a statement Monday, PEN co-interim CEO Clarisse Rosaz Shariyf praised Ruffin for her \u201cbrilliant social commentary, her satire and exceptional talent.\u201d",
      "\u201cShe is truly emblematic of the talented creators who we need on stages and in writers\u2019 rooms during a time of unprecedented censorship in this country. We\u2019re both delighted and honored to have her with us,\" Shariyf added.",
      "PEN also announced Monday that Wesleyan University President Michael Roth will receive the PEN/Benenson Courage Award for \u201chis unwavering commitment to defending academic freedom, protecting protest rights, and resisting attempts to silence dissent in higher education.\u201d Roth has repeatedly criticized the Trump administration's threats to end research funding for Columbia University, Harvard University and other schools, with issues cited ranging from fighting antisemitism to whether transgender athletes can participate in sports.",
      "Ruffin, whose credits include writing for NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers, last year's host for the PEN gala, has said she was cut from the WCHA event after telling organizers that she had no intentions of being evenhanded. During a Daily Beast podcast last month, Ruffin said she was told \u201cyou need to be equal and be sure that you give it to both sides and I was like, \u2018There\u2019s no way that\u2019s going to happen.'\"",
      "Taylor Budowich, a deputy chief of staff at the White House, has called Ruffin a \u201csecond-rate comedian.\"",

      "NEW YORK -- For 11 seasons, Dr. Henry Louis Gates Jr. has sat across from his guests on the popular PBS series \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d and led them through secrets in their family tree. On Tuesday, it's his turn.",
      "The Harvard scholar learns a long-buried puzzle about his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, information which scrambles his ancestry and opens up a new branch that goes back to Ireland.",
      "\u201cI was moved to tears,\u201d Gates tells The Associated Press ahead of the airing. \u201cI used to pass her grave at the Gates' plot in Rose Hill Cemetery and I would say, \u2018Grandma, I\u2019m going to out you. I\u2019m going to tell the world your secret.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is PBS\u2019s most-watched program on linear TV and the most-streamed non-drama program. Season 10 reached nearly 18 million people across linear and digital platforms and also received its first Emmy nomination.",
      "\u201cThe two subliminal messages of \u2019Finding Your Roots,' which are needed more urgently today than ever, is that what has made America great is that we\u2019re a nation of immigrants,\" says Gates. \u201cAnd secondly, at the level of the genome, despite our apparent physical differences, we\u2019re 99.99% the same.\u201d",
      "Season 11 has featured Dax Shepard and Kristen Bell, Melanie Lynskey, chef Jose Andres, Sharon Stone and Amanda Seyfried, who learned why her paternal third-great-grandfather was murdered.",
      "Gates shares the last episode with Laurence Fishburne, who learns the identity of his biological father. It turns out both men adored jazz, which delighted Dyllan McGee, who helped create and produce \u201cFinding Your Roots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt underscored how family connections can shape us, even unknowingly, and made me wonder if reconnecting with our past somehow affirms the significance of our own stories by showing us how much each individual on our tree shapes us even when we don\u2019t know it,\u201d she says.",
      "The series started in 2006 under the title \u201cAfrican American Lives,\u201d conceived by Gates in the middle of the night in his bathroom. He invited prominent Black celebrities and traced their family trees into slavery. When the paper trail ran out, they would use DNA to see which ethnic group they were from in Africa.",
      "Challenged by a viewer to open the show to non-Black celebrities, Gates agreed and the series was renamed \u201cFaces of America,\u201d which had to be changed again after the name was taken. Along the way, Gates had a crash course in DNA.",
      "\u201cFor a guy with a PhD in English literature, I think I can do pretty well on the AP genetics exam,\u201d he says, before proving it with a thorough explanation of autosomal DNA.",
      "Over the years, the show has delivered fascinating results, like when Natalie Morales discovered she\u2019s related to one of the legendary pirates of the Caribbean and when former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Andy Samberg found his biological grandmother and grandfather. It revealed that RuPaul and U.S. Sen. Cory Booker are cousins, as are Meryl Streep and Eva Longoria.",
      "Guests have included former U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, designer Diane von Furstenberg and \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d author George R. R. Martin.",
      "\u201cI always tell my guests that you\u2019re not responsible for the crazy things your ancestors did. I don\u2019t care what they did. Guilt is not inheritable,\u201d Gates says. \u201cYou have to understand how the people functioned in the past without judging them.\u201d",
      "He and his team \u2014 particularly genetic genealogist CeCe Moore \u2014 have found that traditional family stories passed down through the generations are often filled with a few lies, often to cover up bad behavior.",
      "\u201cI call it where there\u2019s smoke, there\u2019s fire. The stories are never accurate, but they\u2019re often close,\u201d says Gates. \u201cThere is a kernel of truth there.\u201d",
      "It took researchers four years to resolve the mystery of who was Gates' great-great grandfather, the man who impregnated Jane Gates. The story she told about her children's father turned out to be not correct.",
      "The researchers show him an 1888 obituary for her and a 1839 ad for her sale. Gates comments that he\u2019s seen a thousand bill of sales like it, but this hit differently. At the end, he looks again at a photo of Jane Gates. \u201cI see a lot of pain in those eyes and now I know why.\u201d",
      "\u201cSomething changed for him that day,\" says McGee. \"I remember him calling me after the reveal saying, 'That was the best day of my life!' It was such a treat for the entire team to be able to give him the gift of a missing link in his family history that he has given hundreds of our guests.\u201d",
      "Gates is a huge advocate that everyone should have their family tree traced and pushes back against the idea that digging up the past is divisive.",
      "\u201cI believe that knowing about our ancestors is fundamental to knowing about ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cThe only way to deal with the past is to know about the past.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn terms of people who would pretend that the past is irrelevant and we need to look forward, William Faulkner wrote, \u2018The past is never dead. It\u2019s not even past,\u2019\u201d Gates adds. \u201cIt\u2019s still with us, shaping both who we are and the society and our norms under which we function.\u201d",

      "The American Library Association has unveiled the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024",
      "NEW YORK -- Removing books from library shelves is no longer just a story of objections from a local community or an individual parent, the American Library Association says.",
      "In its new State of American Libraries Report released Monday, the ALA found more than 70% of attempted bans of a given title or titles come from organized groups and elected officials, and just 16% originated with a parent.",
      "The most commonly criticized books, including Maia Kobabe\u2019s \u201cGender Queer\u201d and the late Toni Morrison's \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d can be found on such websites as www.ratedbooks.org and through lists compiled by Moms for Liberty and other conservative activists.",
      "\u201cWe can trace many of the challenges to lists of books that have been distributed by Moms for Liberty and other groups,\" said Deborah Caldwell-Stone, who directs the association's Office for Intellectual Freedom.",
      "As part of its annual report, the ALA unveiled its list of the 10 most \u201cchallenged books\u201d of 2024, starting with George M. Johnson's \u201cAll Boys Aren't Blue,\u201d and also featuring \u201cGender Queer,\u201d \u201cThe Bluest Eye,\u201d Stephen Chbosky's \u201cThe Perks of Being a Wallflower\u201d and John Green's \u201cLooking for Alaska.\u201d",
      "Most of the books listed have LGBTQ+ themes, continuing a yearslong trend. Other objections include references to drug addiction, such as in Ellen Hopkins' \u201cCrank,\u201d and to slavery and sexual abuse, including those in Patricia McCormick's \u201cSold.\u201d",
      "The ALA defines a challenge as a \u201cformal, written complaint filed with a library or school requesting that materials be removed because of content or appropriateness.\u201d The association, which compiles censorship data through media accounts and reports from librarians, has long believed the actual number of challenges is far higher than the numbers cited in its annual studies.",
      "The report comes at an especially perilous time for libraries. The Trump administration is implementing drastic cuts at the Institute of Museum and Library Services, which already is canceling grants to state libraries.",
      "Bans have surged in recent years and several states, from Texas and Florida to Iowa and Utah, have passed laws restricting what school libraries can acquire. While the ALA is reporting a sharp drop in challenges in 2024, down to 821 attempts compared to 1,247 the year before, the number remains far higher than before 2021.",
      "And Caldwell-Stone doesn't believe censorship is declining. Libraries are now more likely to avoid stocking books that are controversial, or may be prohibited by law, she says.",
      "\u201cI spoke to a librarian from Texas who told me she was looking over a political book and wasn't sure if she could add it to the collection,\u201d Caldwell-Stone said. \u201cLibrarians don't want to get prosecuted or otherwise face legal trouble. A lot of librarians are operating under these kinds of threats.\u201d",

      "Regional Mexican music is crossing borders and going global",
      "MEXICO CITY -- At a Mexican military base, Captain Eduardo Barr\u00f3n picks up not a rifle but a microphone. Swaying boot-to-boot, he belts out a song as the sounds of trumpets and accordions roar from a band of a dozen camouflage-clad soldiers.",
      "The rhythmic style \u2014 known as a corrido \u2014 is recognizable to just about every soul in the Latin American nation of 130 million. But Barr\u00f3n\u2019s lyrics diverge sharply from those blaring on speakers across Mexico.",
      "\u201cI still remember the day I joined the military,\u201d he crooned. \u201cThis is a dream my soul longed for, and if I were to live another life, I\u2019d become a soldier again.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who performs under the name \u201cEddy Barr\u00f3n,\" began releasing music videos and songs on Spotify last year in coordination with the Mexican military. His lyrics extol the army\u2019s virtues, celebrate proud parents and honor the fallen.",
      "They stand in stark contrast to the controversial narco corridos, a subgenre that has sparked controversy as famed artists pay homage to cartel bosses, portraying them as rebels going against the system.",
      "Faced with the challenge of addressing a musical style that depicts cartel violence, local governments across Mexico have increasingly banned performances and pursued criminal investigations of bands and musicians. Mexico\u2019s president even vowed to reduce the popularity of narco corridos while promoting other, less violent musical styles.",
      "But Barr\u00f3n, 33, is taking a different approach. Instead of censorship, he wants to build upon the momentum with his own military corridos, an effort to both infuse the genre with more socially acceptable lyrics and recruit young people to the military.",
      "\u201cNarco life is in style and they make it sound really pretty \u2026 but the reality is different,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re playing our part to invite young people to join this movement of positive music.\u201d",
      "Barron's military ballads are part of a wider government push spearheaded by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, who has proposed that the government promote corridos about \u201clove, falling out of love and peace.\u201d",
      "She even announced a government-sponsored Mexican music competition in the northern state of Durango showcasing music that avoids \u201cglorifying violence, drugs and discrimination against women.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will completely change Mexican music,\u201d she said.",
      "But in a subculture long defined by resistance and putting words to the harsh realities facing the poor, the government's initiatives around the genre have been met with skepticism about official attempts to promote family-friendly narratives.",
      "\u201cI don't think using corridos as a way to incorporate other kinds of narratives, is a bad idea,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Manuel Valenzuela, a Tijuana sociologist who studies the genre. \u201cThere are a lot of songs that sing of peace and love. It\u2019s just that those aren\u2019t the ones that are turning out to be hits \u2026 because we\u2019re living in a moment of aggrieved youth.\u201d",
      "Corridos were born in the 19th century, their classical band instruments and the accordion rooted in German and Polish migration to Mexico. At a time of widespread illiteracy, they were used widely to pass on oral histories.",
      "The ballads took off during the Mexican revolution, when they were used to share stories of war heroes and glory from the conflict.",
      "That is why Barr\u00f3n says he didn\u2019t invent military corridos, but that he\u2019s simply bringing them back.",
      "\u201cCorridos come from the revolution, and we\u2019re doing the same thing as those soldiers and revolutionaries, albeit in a different age, but the result is the same,\u201d he said.",
      "The genre evolved over generations, from singing about smuggling tequila during the 1920\u2019s Prohibition era in corridos tequileros to grappling with the rising wave of cartel violence in Mexico with narco corridos.",
      "\u201cAll the big social issues are told through corridos,\u201d Valenzuela said. \u201cIt\u2019s a metaphor to speak about what we\u2019ve been living through.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n said he would play guitar with his father\u2019s Mexican regional music band as a teenager, and write his own music. He would bring his guitar to play on deployments after he joined the army at 20.",
      "In 2021, he said he began writing his own songs about his time in the military and singing with a military FX Band, named after the type of gun the military uses. But the music never went public.",
      "Around 2023, the genre exploded when artists like Peso Pluma, Fuerza Regida and Natanael Cano began to mix the classic style with trap music in what are known as corridos tumbados. That same year, Peso Pluma bested Taylor Swift as the most streamed artist on YouTube.",
      "A year later, the Mexican army decided to post Barr\u00f3n's music under his artistic name.",
      "The music videos, which have clocked tens of thousands of views on YouTube alone, are layered with images of heavy duty weapons, the Mexican flag, barbed wire and Barr\u00f3n belting out in camouflage and infrared goggles pulled above his military helmet.",
      "Originally intended to entertain troops and boost military recruitment among young Mexicans, Barr\u00f3n's songs took on a different meaning amidst the renewed controversy that has come with the corridos boom.",
      "The musical style has long been criticized for romanticizing cartel violence, but has hit an inflection point in recent years.",
      "Mexican states have implemented performance bans, and prominent artists have received death threats, often claiming to be from rival cartels whose leaders are glorified in their music. And musicians have been forced to cancel shows due to concerns about potential violence.",
      "The controversy intensified last week, after the face of top cartel boss Nemesio Rub\u00e9n \u201cEl Mencho\u201d Oseguera was projected onto a large screen behind the band Los Alegres del Barranco at a music festival in the northern state of Jalisco. The incident, occurring shortly after Oseguera\u2019s cartel was linked to a ranch under investigation as a training camp and body disposal site in Jalisco, sent shockwaves across Mexico.",
      "The performance was met with a cascade of criticisms. Two Mexican states announced criminal investigations, concerts were cancelled and the Trump administration revoked the U.S. visas of band members.",
      "It also marked a hardening in tone by Sheinbaum, who called for an investigation into the concert, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t justify violence or criminal groups.\u201d",
      "Barr\u00f3n, who opposes a ban on corridos, believes the solution is to continue to sing cloaked in camouflage with the hopes of reclaiming the Mexican music from his childhood from the negative stereotypes that have grown to define it.",
      "He said the army is already planning to release new songs in the coming months.",
      "\"Sadly, we've been stuck with this label of corridos as negative music,\" he said. \u201cA better approach is to reclaim the genre and take a different path to shift the conversation.\u201d",

      "North died Sunday at his home in Lake Butler, Florida, after battling colon cancer, said Laurie Jacobson, a longtime friend, and Bonnie Vent, who was his booking agent.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Tom Hardy has collected troves of knowledge and skill throughout his journey as an actor, forming a megastar career. But any education he received from director Guy Ritchie during their time on the 2008 \u201cRocknRolla\u201d film was gained from afar.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t have very much to do with him ... the first time I worked with him. Gerard (Butler) was leading that film and in many elements, we were support staff,\u201d said Hardy. \"So, I got to experience being on the Guy Ritchie set, and it was a bit from a position of not being a lead, and that\u2019s a different responsibility.\u201d",
      "But time can bring people and experiences back around, especially in Hollywood. Since that film 17 years ago, Ritchie has transitioned into esteemed directorial status. And Hardy has morphed into a box office superstar with films like \u201cThe Dark Night\u201d as the imposing villain Bane, and the titular role for Marvel\u2019s \u201cVenom\u201d franchise. Now, the two have reunited for Ritchie\u2019s gritty, yet sophisticated series \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really keen to go back and work with him because he\u2019s a fellow Brit and he\u2019s done quite incredible work,\u201d explained Hardy. \u201cI wanted to go and play with him, actually, and see what that was like now I\u2019m older, and it was good fun.\u201d",
      "The Paramount+ original series follows Harry Da Souza (Hardy), an intimidating, yet calm fixer for a London-based crime family hoping to find the missing son of a rival faction to prevent a catastrophic gang war.",
      "How did Hardy prepare to play such a menacing, yet even-keeled character?",
      "\u201cNo acting required\u201d he said with a big laugh. \u201cJust turn up and, \u2018Oh, yeah, that makes sense\u2019 and say the lines. Don\u2019t bump into the furniture.\u201d",
      "The second episode of the 10-part \u201cMobLand\u201d series airs Sunday on Paramount+.",
      "The series was created by Ronan Bennett, known for popular crime shows like \u201cThe Day of the Jackal\u201d and \u201cTop Boy,\u201d and written with playwright Jez Butterworth. Ritchie serves as executive producer and directed the first two episodes. The \u201cMobLand\u201d idea began as a spinoff from Showtime\u2019s popular \u201cRay Donovan\u201d series, before becoming a stand-alone show.",
      "Two-time Oscar-winner Helen Mirren stars as the devious Maeve, matriarch and manipulator of the crime family, while Pierce Brosnan plays her husband and mob leader, marking a reunion for the pair who worked on the 1980 film \u201cThe Long Good Friday.\u201d",
      "It may be hard to think of a role that Dame Mirren hasn\u2019t played, but she found one with \u201cMobLand.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere are always characters out there that are going to take you by surprise and \u2026 I think, \u2019Oh my god, I\u2019ve never done anything like that before,\u201d said the \u201c1923\u201d star who believes the line between shooting film and TV is now nearly nonexistent. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the sort of beauties of my job, actually, is to constantly be entering into such very, very different worlds.\u201d",
      "Mirren said the opportunity to work with Hardy was intriguing.",
      "\u201cTom\u2019s involvement in it was one of the reasons I signed up because I\u2019ve admired his work over many years,\u201d Mirren said. \u201cDifferent actors, you can see, \u2019Oh, they\u2019re a great actor' \u2026 they can perform. But certain actors like Tom, it\u2019s an interior power that just communicates with the camera. And Tom\u2019s got that. You know what? It\u2019s called star power.\u201d",
      "The \u201cMobLand\u201d cast features Paddy Considine of \u201cHouse of the Dragon\u201d fame, Joanne Froggatt, Lara Pulver, Anson Boon and Mandeep Dhillon. While this show technically reunites Mirren and Brosnan, they also shot the upcoming \u201cThe Thursday Murder Club\u201d film prior to this project.",
      "While much was unknown when Brosnan signed on, \u201cMobLand\u201d had all the right ingredients for the former James Bond to dive in, starting with Ritchie, who released his Netflix series \u201cThe Gentlemen\u201d last year.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s naughty. He\u2019s cheeky. He\u2019s bold,\u201d said Brosnan. \u201cI love his work. His movies. The way he\u2019s acquitted himself on the landscape of cinema. He\u2019s a unique talent all his own \u2026 so I said yes. I wanted to go back to London. I wanted to work.\"",
      "Next for Hardy is the crime drama film \u201cHavoc\u201d premiering later this month, and there's chatter of a potential sequel to his 2015 \u201cMad Max: Fury Road.\u201d A second season of \u201cTaboo\u201d is on the way \u2014 nearly a decade after its debut. What about a \u201cSpider-Man\u201d and \u201cVenom\u201d crossover? Hardy addressed the rumors that an alleged project fell apart, clarifying it was never in the works.",
      "\u201cPeople embellish a story. I just said I would have loved to work with \u2018Spider-Man,\u2019 but it never happened, which is a fact. It hasn\u2019t happened. And I\u2019m no longer working with \u2018Venom\u2019 \u2026 it is a shame because my kids would love to watch Venom and Spider-Man together,\u201d said Hardy. \u201cI would have liked that.\u201d",

      "A day care facility in a Texas county that's part of the measles outbreak has multiple cases, including children too young to be fully vaccinated, public health officials say.",
      "West Texas is in the middle of a still-growing measles outbreak with 481 cases Friday. The state expanded the number of counties in the outbreak area this week to 10. The highly contagious virus began to spread in late January and health officials say it has spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "Three people who were unvaccinated have died from measles-related illnesses this year, including two elementary school-aged children in Texas. The second child died Thursday at a Lubbock hospital, and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the funeral in Seminole, the epicenter of the outbreak.",
      "As of Friday, there were seven cases at a day care where one young child who was infectious gave it to two other children before it spread to other classrooms, Lubbock Public Health director Katherine Wells said.",
      "\u201cMeasles is so contagious I won\u2019t be surprised if it enters other facilities,\u201d Wells said.",
      "There are more than 200 children at the day care, Wells said, and most have had least one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, which is first recommended between 12 and 15 months old and a second shot between 4 and 6 years old.",
      "\u201cWe do have some children that have only received one dose that are now infected,\u201d she said.",
      "The public health department is recommending that any child with only one vaccine get their second dose early, and changed its recommendation for kids in Lubbock County to get the first vaccine dose at 6 months old instead of 1. A child who is unvaccinated and attends the day care must stay home for 21 days since their last exposure, Wells said.",
      "Case count and hospitalization numbers in Texas have climbed steadily since the outbreak began, and spiked by 81 cases from March 28 to April 4, with 16 more people hospitalized in that time.",
      "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met with Texas officials Monday to determine how many people it would send to West Texas to assist with the outbreak response, spokesman Jason McDonald said Monday. He expected a small team to arrive later this week, followed by a bigger group on the ground next week.",
      "The CDC said its first team was in the region from early March to April 1, withdrawing on-the-ground support days before a second child died in the outbreak.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Monday said he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoridation in communities nationwide. Kennedy also said he\u2019s assembling a task force to focus on the issue.",
      "Also on Monday, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced it is reviewing \u201cnew scientific information\" on potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water.",
      "Kennedy told The Associated Press of his plans after a news conference in Salt Lake City.",
      "Utah last month became the first state to ban fluoride in public drinking water, pushing past opposition from dentists and national health organizations who warned the move would lead to medical problems that disproportionately affect low-income communities.",
      "Republican Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation barring cities and communities from deciding whether to add the cavity-preventing mineral to their water systems. Water systems across the state must shut down their fluoridation systems by May 7.",
      "Kennedy praised Utah for emerging as \u201cthe leader in making America healthy again.\u201d He was flanked by Utah legislative leaders and the sponsor of the state\u2019s fluoride law. \u201cI\u2019m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban it, and I hope many more will,\u201d he said.",
      "EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who appeared with Kennedy at the news conference, said his agency was launching a renewed examination of scientific studies on the potential health risks of fluoride in drinking water to help inform any changes to the national standards.",
      "\u201cWhen this evaluation is completed, we will have an updated foundational scientific evaluation that will inform the agency\u2019s future steps,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cSecretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment.\u201d",
      "Fluoride strengthens teeth and reduces cavities by replacing minerals lost during normal wear and tear, according to the CDC. In 1950, federal officials endorsed water fluoridation to prevent tooth decay, and in 1962 set guidelines for how much should be added to water.",
      "Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has called fluoride a \u201cdangerous neurotoxin\u201d and said also it\u2019s been associated with arthritis, bone breaks, and thyroid disease. Some studies have suggested such links might exist, usually at higher-than-recommended fluoride levels, though some reviewers have questioned the quality of available evidence and said no definitive conclusions can be drawn.",
      "Fluoride can come from a number of sources, but drinking water is the main one for Americans, researchers say. Nearly two-thirds of the U.S. population gets fluoridated drinking water, according to CDC data. The addition of low levels of fluoride to drinking water was long considered one of the greatest public health achievements of the last century.",
      "About one-third of community water systems \u2014 17,000 out of 51,000 across the U.S. \u2014 serving more than 60% of the population fluoridated their water, according to a 2022 CDC analysis. The agency currently recommends 0.7 milligrams of fluoride per liter of water.",
      "But over time, studies have documented potential problems. Too much fluoride has been associated with streaking or spots on teeth. Studies also have traced a link between excess fluoride and brain development.",
      "A report last year by the federal government\u2019s National Toxicology Program, which summarized studies conducted in Canada, China, India, Iran, Pakistan and Mexico, concluded that drinking water with more than 1.5 milligrams of fluoride per liter \u2014 more than twice the recommended level in the U.S. \u2014 was associated with lower IQs in kids.",

      "ATHENS, Greece -- A medical charity working in Greece says it has diagnosed six young children living in a migrant facility on the eastern Aegean island of Samos as suffering from malnutrition, the first time its doctors have made such a diagnosis since the facility opened in 2021.",
      "The Greek section of Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French acronym MSF, said Monday its staff had diagnosed the children, who are aged between 6 months and 6 years old, with moderate to severe acute malnutrition and in need of immediate medical intervention.",
      "\u201cChildren make up about 25% of the (camp\u2019s) population, yet pediatric care remains insufficient, not only within the center but on the entire island of Samos,\u201d MSF Greece\u2019s Director General Christina Psarra said in a news release.",
      "The six children, who hailed from Afghanistan and Syria, all arrived in the camp with their families within the last two to three months, and it was not possible to determine whether they had already been suffering from malnutrition before they arrived, Psarra told The Associated Press.",
      "However, \u201cdefinitely the conditions in the camp have made things more difficult and have had an aggravating effect,\u201d she said.",
      "Asked about the MSF claims, the Ministry of Migration and Asylum said it would have a response later Monday.",
      "Psarra said that while meals were provided for the camp\u2019s residents, the diet \u201cis not nutritious for children of this age.\u201d The situation was exacerbated by the severance nine months ago of a stipend provided to asylum seekers in Greece, which had allowed them to purchase fresh food and other basic necessities, she added.",
      "Officially designated as a \u201cclosed controlled access center,\u201d the European Union-funded migrant camp in Samos, built on a hillside about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the island\u2019s main port of Vathy, was opened in 2021 to replace a massively overcrowded camp that had developed on the town\u2019s fringes.",
      "The camp, which is guarded by police and private security, has a capacity of 3,664 people and as of Monday, it was housing 3,176 people, according to the Ministry of Migration and Asylum.",
      "Psarra noted that the children had already endured grueling journeys to arrive in Samos, and conditions inside the camp exacerbated their medical situation.",
      "Rights groups have reported dire conditions in the camp in Samos, including poor sanitation and a shortage of running water.",
      "\u201cThey are children who have been through painful journeys. They have had many difficulties in arriving,\u201d Psarra said of the malnourished children on Samos. \u201cThe conditions in the camp makes it even worse.\u201d",
      "Greece lies on one of the most popular routes into the EU for people fleeing conflict and poverty in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Many make the short but treacherous boat journey from the Turkish coast to nearby Greek islands like Samos, often in small, unseaworthy inflatable dinghies.",
      "Last week, at least seven people, including three children, died near another Greek island, Lesbos, after the inflatable dinghy they were traveling in sank. Another 23 people survived and were taken to a migrant camp in Lesbos.",

      "The \u201cZero Suicide Model\u201d was developed in 2001 at Detroit-based Henry Ford Health, where the focus on people considering suicide included collaborating with patients to reduce their access to lethal means such as firearms and then following up with treatment.",
      "The approach made a difference, and for all of 2009, the health system saw no suicides among patients. The researchers then studied what happened when a different health system, Kaiser Permanente, adopted the program in four locations from 2012 through 2019.",
      "Suicides and suicide attempts fell in three of the locations, while the fourth maintained a low rate of suicides and attempts. Suicide attempts were tracked in electronic health records and insurance claims data. Suicides were measured using government death records.",

      "The study, published Monday in JAMA Network Open, shows the model works, said Katherine Keyes, a Columbia University public health professor who studies suicide.",
      "Prior research has shown that nearly everyone who dies by suicide is seen by a health care provider in the year before their death, Keyes said. Many doctor's offices have started asking patients whether they've thought about harming themselves.",

      "U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the epicenter of Texas' still-growing measles outbreak on Sunday, the same day a funeral was held for a second young child who was not vaccinated and died from a measles-related illness.",
      "Kennedy said in a social media post that he was working to \u201ccontrol the outbreak\" and went to Gaines County to comfort the families who have buried two young children. He was seen late Sunday afternoon outside of a Mennonite church where the funeral services were held, but he did not attend a nearby news conference held by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about the outbreak.",
      "Seminole is the epicenter of the outbreak, which started in late January and continues to swell \u2014 with nearly 500 cases in Texas alone, plus cases from the outbreak believed to have spread to New Mexico, Oklahoma, Kansas and Mexico.",
      "The second young child died Thursday from \"what the child's doctor described as measles pulmonary failure,\u201d and did not have underlying health conditions, the Texas State Department of State Health Services said Sunday in a news release. Aaron Davis, a spokesperson for UMC Health System in Lubbock, said that the child was \u201creceiving treatment for complications of measles while hospitalized.\u201d",
      "This is the third known measles-related death tied to this outbreak. One was another elementary school-aged child in Texas and the other was an adult in New Mexico; neither were vaccinated.",
      "It's Kennedy's first visit to the area as health secretary, where he said he met with families of both the 6- and 8-year-old children who died. He said he \u201cdeveloped bonds\u201d with the Mennonite community in West Texas in which the virus is mostly spreading.",
      "Kennedy, an anti-vaccine advocate before ascending to the role of nation\u2019s top health secretary earlier this year, has resisted urging widespread vaccinations as the measles outbreak has worsened under his watch. On Sunday, however, he said in a lengthy statement posted on X that it was \u201cthe most effective way to prevent the spread of measles.\"",
      "The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine has been used safely for more than 60 years and is 97% effective against measles after two doses.",
      "Dr. Manisha Patel, CDC incident manager, said in a Sunday news conference that the MMR vaccine is the best way to protect against measles. She also told parents in Gaines County that it was important not to \u201cdelay care\u201d for a child who is sick with measles.",
      "\u201cCall your doctor and make sure you\u2019re talking to a health care professional who can guide you on those next steps,\" Patel said.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s social media post said CDC employees had been \u201credeployed.\u201d CDC spokesman Jason McDonald clarified late Sunday that the first CDC team arrived in early March and left Gaines County on April 1, while a team led by Patel \u201cwas redeployed and arrived today to assess needs\" as ordered by Kennedy and requested by Texas' governor.",
      "Asked about the outbreak Sunday by reporters on Air Force One, Trump said, \u201cthey\u2019re doing reports on it,\u201d adding that if the outbreak \u201cprogresses, we\u2019ll will have to take action very strongly.\u201d",
      "Neither the CDC nor the state health department included the death in their measles reports issued Friday, but the CDC acknowledged it when asked Sunday.",
      "The number of cases in Texas shot up by 81 between March 28 and April 4, and 16 more people were hospitalized. Nationwide, the U.S. has more than double the number of measles cases it saw in all of 2024.",
      "Republican U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy from Louisiana, a liver doctor whose vote helped cinch Kennedy\u2019s confirmation, called Sunday for stronger messaging from health officials in a post on X.",
      "\u201cEveryone should be vaccinated! There is no treatment for measles. No benefit to getting measles,\u201d he wrote. \u201cTop health officials should say so unequivocally b/4 another child dies.\u201d",
      "Cassidy has requested Kennedy to appear before his health committee Thursday, although Kennedy has not publicly confirmed whether he will attend.",
      "A CDC spokesperson noted the efficacy of the measles vaccine Sunday but stopped short of calling on people to get it. Departing from long-standing public health messaging around vaccination, the spokesperson called the decision a \u201cpersonal one\u201d and encouraged people to talk with their doctor. People \u201cshould be informed about the potential risks and benefits associated with vaccines,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Misinformation about how to prevent and treat measles is hindering a robust public health response, including claims about vitamin A supplements that have been pushed by Kennedy and holistic medicine supporters despite doctors\u2019 warnings that it should be given under a physician's orders and that too much can be dangerous.",
      "Doctors at Covenant Children's Hospital in Lubbock, where the first measles death occurred, say they've treated fewer than 10 children for liver issues from vitamin A toxicity, which they found when running routine lab tests on children who are not fully vaccinated and have measles. Dr. Lara Johnson, chief medical officer, said the patients reported using vitamin A to treat and prevent the virus.",
      "Dr. Peter Marks, the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s former vaccine chief, said responsibility for the death rests with Kennedy and his staff. Marks was forced out of the FDA after disagreements with Kennedy over vaccine safety.",
      "\u201cThis is the epitome of an absolute needless death,\u201d Marks told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday. \u201cThese kids should get vaccinated \u2014 that\u2019s how you prevent people from dying of measles.\u201d",
      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn\u2019t mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease \u2014 and declining childhood vaccination rates nationwide \u2014 some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

      "The report said the country's drug market for cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine is worth about $3.5 billion, and growing.",
      "While the Community Oriented Substance Use Program in Pretoria is fully funded by the municipality and the university, it is indirectly affected by the shock to the global aid system. Some nonprofits that the program partners with have closed.",

      "Now, harm reduction programs like the Pretoria one for drug users will face stiff competition for sharply shrinking resources.",
      "As doctors did consultations, Phumulani Mahlangu expressed regret for his situation. The 30-year-old said he is addicted to a heroin mixture locally known as nyaope. He is homeless and has three children in his hometown nearly 200 kilometers (124 miles) away.",

      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- Furious that an Iranian official had entered Argentina as an ordinary citizen on a tourist visa, Argentine lawmakers this week attacked the nation's spy agency. They asked the government to investigate the Iranian deputy's vacation in Argentina, a country where several other Iranian politicians still stand accused of carrying out deadly bombings in Buenos Aires in the 1990s. Tehran denies the accusations.",
      "\u201cThe intelligence agency allowed a vice-president of Iran to enter our country, it's terrible,\u201d Florencia Carignano, a lawmaker from hardline opposition Peronist bloc, Uni\u00f3n por la Patria, told fellow legislators Tuesday on the foreign relations committee. \u201cI am seriously worried.\u201d She paused for a beat, then exclaimed, \u201cIran!\u201d",
      "The heated discussion in Argentina\u2019s Congress marks the latest fallout from the luxury vacation that Shahram Dabiri and his wife took earlier this year. Dabiri had served as vice president of parliamentary affairs in Iran before being fired last week over the trip in Argentina, which Iran's president criticized as \u201clavish\u201d and \u201cindefensible.\"",
      "Although Dabiri reportedly paid for the trip with his own money, several Instagram photos that showed him and his wife boarding an expensive cruise from southern Argentina to Antarctica and posing in what appears to be an opulent cathedral angered Iranians struggling to scrape by in the sanctions-hit economy.",
      "Argentines were also angered by Dabiri's trip, for a different reason. The South American country remains deeply traumatized by the bombing attacks against the Israeli Embassy and a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1992 and 1994 respectively, which killed over 100 people.",
      "Despite probes marred by corruption and delays over the past three decades, Argentine prosecutors have long maintained that Iranian operatives and senior officials played key roles in the attacks. Argentina believes that Iran is shielding in the high echelons of its political establishment various people accused of having authorized the attack, including former Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi.",
      "Any incident involving Iranians in Argentina can quickly snowball into a crisis. Last year, for instance, Argentina grounded a Venezuelan-owned cargo jet and detained its Iranian crew members for an investigation into possible terrorism ties before releasing them for lack of evidence.",
      "Carignano, the left-leaning lawmaker on the parliamentary foreign affairs committee who previously served as an immigration minister, announced that she'd learned that Dabiri had not properly declared himself as a government official in his visa application. She said that he had applied for a tourist visa, identifying himself only as a doctor.",
      "There was no immediate response from Argentina's foreign ministry. The Iranian Embassy in Buenos Aires did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iran's Tabriz University of Medical Sciences describes Dabiri as a physician and professor of nuclear medicine on its website.",
      "Two other lawmakers on Tuesday backed Carignano\u2019s order for a government inquiry into Dabiri\u2019s roughly two-week vacation. They asked how he'd managed to travel on a tourist visa and why the country's intelligence agency reportedly had not alerted immigration authorities to his entry.",
      "\u201cWhat happened? That\u2019s what we want to know,\" Carignano wrote on social media Wednesday.",

      "BANGKOK -- A U.S scholar teaching in Thailand who was jailed on charges of insulting the country\u2019s monarchy \u2014 an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison \u2014 was released on bail on Wednesday, but also had his visa revoked, an indication he could be deported soon.",
      "An appeals court granted Paul Chambers\u2019 release on bail after it was twice denied on Tuesday by a lower court, said the advocacy group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights. No trial date has been set.",
      "However, since immigration police earlier on Wednesday revoked his visa, Chambers could be deported home to the United States at any time. He has the right to appeal the visa revocation within 48 hours, according to police Maj. Gen. Sarawut Khonyai.",
      "Chambers was first jailed on Tuesday pending trial following a complaint by the Thai army that he had insulted the nation\u2019s monarchy, an offense also known as \u201c112\u201d after its article number in the criminal code. He has been working as a lecturer at Naresuan University in Thailand\u2019s northern province of Phitsanulok,",
      "The U.S. State Department said in a statement Tuesday that it was alarmed by Chamber\u2019s arrest and urged \"Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\"",
      "A 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, Chambers has studied the Thai military, which has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The charge against him was related to a webinar he took part in last October, organized by the ISEAS\u2013Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore. His defenders say he had nothing to do with what was quoted in the charge sheet. He was also charged with violating the Computer Crime Act, covering online activities.",
      "Akarachai Chaimaneekarakate of the Thai lawyers' group said Chambers\u2019 visa was revoked on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking.",
      "Thai law calls for 3-15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere. The legislation has also been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people \u2014 many of them student activists \u2014 have been charged with violating the law.",

      "GENEVA -- The Zurich Zoo\u2019s beloved gorilla of more than 40 years has been put down after a long struggle with declining health, a zoo official in the Swiss city said Wednesday.",
      "N\u2019Gola was 47 and one of the oldest male gorillas in European zoos, said Zurich Zoo director Severin Dressen.",
      "He was a Western lowland gorilla \u2014 a subspecies of the great apes found in Africa and listed as critically endangered \u2014 and because of his mature age he was a silverback, after the gray hair on his back.",
      "N'Gola had suffered a host of health ailments, including arthritis, a heart condition and a tapeworm infection. He had been on painkillers for several years, eating less, and losing weight and muscle mass.",

      "\"We\u2019ve seen a crash in the wild over the span of three generations of 80% of the population,\" Dressen said about the decline of gorillas in the wild. Zoos can be helpful for research and public education about species protection, he added.",
      "N'Gola was born in captivity and fathered 34 children. He was known for his sensitive side, taking \u201ccare of his harem, his group of females,\u201d Dressen said.",
      "In 2012, the female Nache in his harem suffered a burst appendix during advanced pregnancy, and both she and the unborn baby gorilla died, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuricher Zeitung.",
      "N\u2019Gola spent weeks whimpering through the zoo enclosure looking for her, the report said.",
      "Dressen also recalled a time when N'Gola looked after a baby gorilla in the group. \"The mother wasn\u2019t there, and he kind of \u2014 which is not a typical silverback behavior \u2014 took care of that baby.\u201d",
      "As for humans, N'Gola mostly ignored \"other bipedal species on the other side of the glass\u201d of his enclosure, Dressen said.",

      "Some Sudan People Liberation Movement-In-Opposition leaders loyal to Rick Machar, who remains under house arrest, skipped the meeting in which the country's minister of peacebuilding, Stephen Kuol Par, was named interim chair. Some Machar loyalists have fled the country.",
      "When asked if his appointment was a coup against Machar, Par said it wasn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cWhat we have done is to resolve this leadership crisis that has been created by the crisis that comes as a result of the detention of our chairman and the desertion of our other leaders like the deputy chair and the secretary general,\u201d he said.",
      "Par appealed for the release of Machar and other senior SPLM-IO members who were detained following deadly violence in the country\u2019s north.",
      "\u201cThis act of detention undermines the principles of peace and dialogue essential for our nation\u2019s recovery,\u201d he said.",

      "In a Wednesday post on Facebook, SPLM-IO spokesperson Lam Paul Gabriel called Par and those who did attend the meeting \u201cbetrayers.\u201d",
      "There were high hopes when oil-rich South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 after a long conflict. But the country slid into a civil war in December 2013 largely based on ethnic divisions when forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battled those loyal to Machar, an ethnic Nuer.",
      "More than 400,000 people were killed in the war, which ended with a 2018 peace agreement that brought Kiir and Machar together in a unity government. Under the agreement, elections were supposed to be held in February 2023, but they were postponed until December 2024 \u2014 and again until 2026.",

      "Par dismissed the suspension, calling it \u201cthe joke of the year\" and saying the party \u201ccannot be led or take orders from self-exiled leaders.\u201d",
      "Despite fears that the recent violence, arrests and accusations could signal that South Sudan is teetering on the edge of a renewed civil war, some analysts say the change in SPLM-IO leadership may not necessarily scuttle the 2018 peace deal.",

      "\u201cThe peace agreement will not collapse, but it will be shaking in the way that there will be suspension for those who are loyal to Machar and the supporters of Machar will then fight the system,\u201d Kuol told The Associated Press.",

      "South Sudan\u2019s political climate remains fragile after White Army overran and army base in the north and government troops responded with airstrikes. Government forces also staged two attacks on opposition forces' training barracks outside the capital, Juba.",

      "It was the first known meeting since the pope\u2019s return to the Vatican after five weeks in the hospital for life-threatening double pneumonia. Francis had planned to have an audience with Charles, but the official state visit to the Vatican was postponed due to the pope\u2019s health.",
      "The pope issued a new invitation for a private audience, but it was subject to his health and only confirmed Wednesday morning. The mid-afternoon visit lasted about 20 minutes and included a private exchange of gifts. Discussions continue about a future visit by the monarch to the Vatican.",
      "The Vatican statement said the pope wished Charles and Camilla a happy anniversary, and the king and queen in return wished the pope a speedy recovery. Buckingham Palace said \"their majesties were delighted the pope was well enough to host them, and to have had the opportunity to share their best wishes in person.''",
      "The royal couple previously saw Francis during an April 2017 visit to the Vatican. King Charles, then Prince of Wales, also met Pope Francis during the 2019 canonization of St. John Henry Newman.",
      "The pope has been convalescing at the Vatican since March 23 and made an appearance to the faithful in St. Peter\u2019s Square on Sunday. He was pushed in a wheelchair, wearing nasal tubes for supplemental oxygen, and wished the crowd a good Sunday from the front of the altar before being greeted by participants in the Mass, some of whom leaned to kiss his hands.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Charles stressed the need for close ties between Italy and the UK in a historic speech in the Italian parliament, calling for unity in defense of common values at a time of war in Europe.",
      "Charles, the first British monarch and fourth foreign leader to address a joint session of the Italian parliament, highlighted the long history between the U.K. and Italy and their shared culture, going back to the ancient Romans.",
      "\u201cOur younger generations can see in the news every day on their smartphones and tablets that peace is never to be taken for granted,\u201d Charles said.",

      "\u201cOur countries have both stood by Ukraine in her hour of need and welcomed many thousands of Ukrainians requiring shelter,\u201d he said in his speech, warning that images of wars were now reverberating again across the continent.",
      "Charles added that Italian and British armed forces \u201cstand side by side\u201d as part of the NATO alliance, noting the two countries\u2019 joint plans to develop with Japan a new fighter jet.",
      "\u201cIt will generate thousands of jobs in our countries and speaks volumes about the trust we place in each other,\u201d he said.",
      "During the Italian trip, King Charles and Queen Camilla also marked their 20th wedding anniversary, which was to include a state dinner later Wednesday hosted by President Sergio Mattarella at the Quirinale palace.",
      "The queen marked her anniversary by wearing her wedding dress, which had been modified by its designer Anne Valentine, with additional embroidery by King\u2019s Foundation artisan Beth Somerville. The garment was originally worn for the civil ceremony, when Camilla paired the outfit with a hat made of natural straw, overlaid with ivory French lace designed by Philip Treacy.",
      "On her wedding day, Camilla later wore a separate chiffon dress embroidered pale blue and gold coat for the wedding blessing at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Charles met Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni at Rome\u2019s Villa Doria Pamphili, enjoying a walk in the 17th Century palace\u2019s gardens.",
      "In a few weeks, he will mark the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War in Europe together with Mattarella.",
      "Charles also spoke passionately in his address about threats facing the planet, recalling another speech he gave in Italy 16 years ago and how the \u201cwarnings\u201d he made at the time about the urgency of the climate challenge were \u201cdepressingly being borne out by events.\u201d",
      "He noted extreme storms \u201cnormally seen once in a generation\u201d are now an issue every year, and \u201ccountless precious plant and animal species face extinction in our lifetimes\u201d.",
      "Sections of the speech were delivered in Italian, with the King prompting the applause of Italian lawmakers when he noted: \u201cAnd by the way, I hope I\u2019m not ruining Dante\u2019s language so much that I\u2019m no never invited to Italy again.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar made her first visit to the military-ruled nation since her appointment last year, meeting Wednesday with the foreign minister as the country recovers from an earthquake that killed more than 3,600 people.",
      "The envoy, Australia\u2019s Julie Bishop, met with Foreign Minister Than Swe and other officials at a temporary tented area outside of the ministry\u2019s damaged building in the capital Naypyitaw, which was hard hit by the 7.7 magnitude quake on March 28, Myanmar's MRTV state television said.",
      "The earthquake caused significant damage to six regions and states, leaving many areas without power, telephone or cell connections and damaging roads and bridges, exacerbating hardships caused by the Southeast Asian nation's continuing civil war.",
      "Maj. Gen. Zaw Min Tun, a spokesperson for the military government, said late Wednesday that the quake\u2019s death toll has reached 3,649, with 5,018 injured and 145 missing.",

Soe Win, the vice chairman of the ruling military council.",

      "Bishop, a former Australian foreign minister and current chancellor of the Australian National University, was appointed as Secretary-General Antonio Guterres\u2019 envoy to Myanmar in April last year.",
      "Her appointment drew flak last month when a group opposed to military rule in Myanmar alleged that she had business links with Chinese companies with interests in Myanmar, amounting to a conflict of interest. She denied any wrongdoing. China, along with Russia, is one of the ruling military\u2019s major backers, while much of the Western world shuns and sanctions the generals for toppling democracy and serious human rights abuses, including the brutal use of force in its war against the pro-democracy resistance and ethnic minority guerrillas.",
      "Guterres said ahead of Bishop\u2019s visit that it would \u201creinforce the UN\u2019s commitment to peace and dialogue.\u201d",
      "Although the military government and its armed opponents have declared unilateral ceasefires for a temporary period to facilitate relief and rehabilitation efforts in the wake of the earthquake, continued fighting is widespread, according to independent Myanmar media and witnesses.",
      "Myanmar has been in turmoil since February 2021, when Myanmar\u2019s army ousted Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s elected government and then violently cracked down on widespread protests against its actions. After security forces unleashed lethal force on peaceful demonstrators, some opponents of military rule took up arms.",
      "The office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General on Monday announced that Bishop had visited Malaysia, a key partner of the United Nations in efforts to support a Myanmar-led political solution to the crisis and to respond to humanitarian needs following the earthquake.",
      "The quake worsened an already dire humanitarian crisis, with more than 3 million people displaced from their homes by the war and nearly 20 million in need even before it hit, according to the United Nations.",
      "A situation report issued late Monday by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said more than 17.2 million people are living in affected areas, and urgently need food, drinking water, health care, cash assistance and emergency shelter.",
      "It was not immediately known if Bishop would meet the leader of the military government, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, or the country\u2019s ousted civilian leader, Suu Kyi, who is imprisoned in Naypyitaw.",
      "Suu Kyi, 79, is serving prison sentences totaling 27 years after being convicted in a series of politically tainted prosecutions.

      "Bongo was placed in house arrest after the coup but freed a week later due to health concerns. His wife and son were detained and charged with corruption and embezzlement of public funds. Bongo himself was not charged.",
      "Following the coup, soldiers proclaimed Oligui Nguema, the Republican Guard chief and a cousin of Bongo, as president of a transitional committee to lead the country. He promised to \u201creturn power to civilians\u201d through \u201ccredible elections.\u201d",

      "Oligui Nguema\u2019s main challenger is Bongo\u2019s former prime minister Alain Claude Bilie-By-Nze. He has promised to reorganize public finances, create jobs for young people and \u201cend the umbilical cord\u201d with former colonial ruler France.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, Bilie-By-Nze asserted that the upcoming election is not fair or transparent.",
      "\u201cEverything has been done to lock down the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ministry of the interior and the various electoral commissions are run by people close to the putschist candidate. The ruling candidate also benefits from all the resources of the state for his campaign, while his opponents received no public funding.\u201d",
      "Bilie-By-Nze pledged \u201ca break with the old system and a new independence. Political, diplomatic and economic independence.\u201d",

      "Oligui Nguema is expected to win Saturday's election, political analysts say.",

      "Bongo served two terms after taking power in 2009 following the death of his father, who ruled for 41 years. There was widespread discontent with the family\u2019s reign. A small political elite lived in oil-funded luxury while much of the population struggled. More than a third of the population lived under the poverty line in 2022, according the the World Bank.",

      "\u201cThe instances we recorded include physical attacks, threats, including severe death threats, online smear campaigns, raids of offices without search warrants and blockades of journalists and media.\u201d de Zeeuw said.",

      "BERLIN -- Conservative leader Friedrich Merz is on course to become post-World War II Germany's 10th chancellor after finalizing a deal Wednesday to form a new government.",
      "Merz, 69, who will succeed outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz, has vowed to prioritize European unity and the continent's security as it grapples with the new Trump administration and Russia's war on Ukraine.",
      "Merz\u2019s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany\u2019s election on Feb. 23. He then turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz\u2019s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority. He has already pushed through plans to enable higher defense spending, and faced more pressure to finish the deal after U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement of sweeping tariffs created significant market disruption.",
      "As chancellor, Merz will face the challenge of helping to fill a leadership vacuum and craft a united response to recent U.S. policy shifts that have strained the transatlantic alliance.",
      "The top job has been late in coming for Merz, a trained lawyer who saw his ascent derailed by former Chancellor Angela Merkel in the early 2000s and even turned his back on active politics for several years. Despite his political experience, he is heading to the chancellery without previously having served in government.",
      "Merkel has described Merz as a brilliant speaker and complimented his desire for leadership, though she acknowledged this was a problem in their relationship.",
      "\u201cWe are almost the same age ... We grew up completely differently, which was more of an opportunity than an obstacle,\" she wrote in her memoir \"Freedom.\"",
      "\"But there was one problem, right from the start: We both wanted to be the boss,\u201d she said.",
      "Merkel moved to consolidate her grip on Germany's center-right after the Union narrowly lost a national election in 2002. She pushed Merz aside as leader of its parliamentary group, taking the job herself in addition to the leadership of the Christian Democratic Union party she already held. She went on to lead Germany from 2005 to 2021.",
      "Merz turned his back on active politics for several years after leaving the parliament in 2009.",

      "Volker Resing, who wrote the recent biography \u201cFriedrich Merz: His Path to Power,\" says that Merz would possibly be \u201cthe most international chancellor\" Germany has had since 1945.",
      "Merz launched his political comeback after Merkel stepped down as CDU leader in 2018 and announced that she wouldn't seek a fifth term of chancellor. However, he was narrowly defeated by centrist candidates in party leadership votes in 2018 and early 2021.",
      "But he persisted and was finally elected party leader in the third attempt, after the center-right's defeat by current Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Germany's 2021 election. Merz cemented his power by also becoming the leader of the Union's parliamentary group.",
      "According to Resing, Merz does not believe in avoiding confrontation at all costs, but believes that \u201ca certain amount of provocation can set off a real debate and perhaps a real development in motion.\u201d",
      "During the election campaign, Merz vowed to make Germany's ailing economy strong again and curb irregular migration.",
      "With President Donald Trump back in the White House and tensions rising over how to resolve the war in Ukraine, Merz, who has long supported a strong transatlantic relationship, said after his victory that his top priority is to unify Europe in the face of challenges coming from the United States and Russia.",
      "Merz put toughening Germany's immigration laws at the forefront of the election campaign after a migrant killed two people in a knife attack in the Bavarian city of Aschaffenburg last month.",
      "He brought a nonbinding motion before the parliament, calling for many more migrants to be turned back at Germany's borders. The motion was narrowly approved thanks to votes from the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party.",
      "That prompted his opponents to accuse Merz of breaking a taboo in allegedly working with the AfD, and a public rebuke from Merkel. Critics pointed to the episode as an illustration of what they say is Merz\u2019s tendency to impulsiveness.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of Germans took to the streets to protest against both Merz' motion and also the rise of the far right.",
      "Merz has insisted he did nothing wrong and never worked with AfD, and also repeatedly vowed to \u201cnever\u201d work with the party if he becomes chancellor.",
      "Merz represents his rural region in Germany\u2019s parliament \u2014 an area where people are \u201crather down-to-earth, perhaps a little reserved,\u201d Resing said. \u201cThat\u2019s what shaped him: rural life.\u201d",
      "As a politician, Merz has always championed conservative values and stressed the importance of family.",
      "He met his wife Charlotte, who is now a judge, while he was studying law, and they have three grown children.",
      "Merz joined the CDU in 1972 and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989. He first joined the German parliament in 1994.",
      "A pilot openly passionate about his hobby, Merz sometimes would fly his own small plane from his home in the Sauerland region in western Germany to Berlin on Monday mornings.",
      "He has stuck to flying, despite the long hours imposed by his job as opposition leader and occasional criticism that he is indulging in a rich man's hobby.",
      "\u201cWhen you talk to him about flying, his eyes light up,\u201d Resing said. \"He says that when you\u2019re above the clouds, that\u2019s freedom.\u201d",

      "CAIRO -- U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has reversed new cutoffs in emergency food aid to several nations but maintained them in Afghanistan and Yemen, two of the world's poorest and most war-ravaged countries, according to the State Department and officials who spoke to The Associated Press.",
      "It marks the latest round of abrupt cancellations of foreign aid contracts run through the U.S. Agency for International Development and equally sudden reversals. The whipsawing moves come as the Republican administration and Trump adviser Elon Musk\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency dismantle USAID and dramatically reduce foreign assistance, asserting that the spending is wasteful and advances liberal causes.",
      "The United States over the weekend sent notices terminating funding for U.N. World Food Program emergency programs in more than a dozen countries. Aid officials warned that the cuts could threaten the lives of millions of refugees and other vulnerable people, stressing the risks of further destabilizing regions ridden by conflicts.",
      "The State Department confirmed Wednesday that it had reversed those cuts in Somalia, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Ecuador. It said it would keep the cancellations for Afghanistan and Yemen but left the fate of food aid in six other unidentified nations unclear.",
      "Even in Syria, Somalia and other crisis areas where it had reinstated support for lifesaving food programs, the U.S. would work with the U.N. to modify its funding \"to better align with Administration priorities,\u201d the State Department said by email. It gave no details.",
      "Two USAID officials said Jeremy Lewin, the DOGE associate overseeing the dismantling of the aid agency, ordered the reversal of some of his contract terminations Tuesday, after the AP reported them. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to brief the media.",
      "The USAID officials said Lewin sent a note internally expressing regret for the sudden contract terminations and reversals. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and others had pledged that the kind of lifesaving aid targeted would be spared.",
      "A United Nations official said the decision to restore funding came after intense behind-the-scenes lobbying of members of Congress by senior U.N. officials.",
      "The State Department on Wednesday defended some of the new funding cuts, including for Yemen and Afghanistan, saying they were based on \"credible and longstanding concerns that funding was benefitting terrorist groups including the Houthis and the Taliban.\u201d",
      "At a briefing this week, department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce cited a U.S. government watchdog's 2024 finding that department contractors reported paying at least $10.9 million to Afghanistan's Taliban government in taxes, utility payments and fees.",
      "\u201cOther programs with WFP that were terminated were contrary to an America First agenda and didn\u2019t make America stronger, safer, or more prosperous,\u201d the department said Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, urged the administration to restore funding for other critical programs as well.",
      "\u201cDespite continued assurances that life-saving programs would be protected during the Trump Administration\u2019s \u2018review\u2019 of foreign assistance, DOGE again spent the weekend cutting World Food Program assistance to feed people in crisis,\" the New Hampshire senator said.",
      "It will \u201cweaken America's standing around the world,\u201d she added.",
      "Nathaniel Raymond, executive director of the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health, called the cuts \u201ca potential extinction-level event\u201d for two generations of progress in limiting the suffering of those caught in crises.",
      "The U.S. had been the largest funder of the WFP, providing $4.5 billion of the $9.8 billion in donations to the world's largest food aid provider last year. Previous administrations had viewed such aid as serving U.S. national security by alleviating conflict, poverty and extremism and curbing migration.",
      "More than half of Afghanistan\u2019s population \u2014 some 23 million people \u2014 need humanitarian assistance. It's a crisis caused by decades of conflict \u2014 including the 20-year U.S. war with the Taliban \u2014 as well as entrenched poverty and climate shocks.",
      "Last year, the United States provided 43% of all international humanitarian funding to Afghanistan.",
      "The cuts affect about $560 million in humanitarian aid, including for emergency food assistance, treatment of malnourished babies, medical care, safe drinking water and mental health treatment for survivors of sexual and physical violence, according to an assessment by current and former USAID officials and partner organizations. The figure has not been confirmed by the U.S. government.",

      "LONDON -- The British government has refused to rule out nationalizing the last plant in the U.K. that makes steel from raw materials as the global trade war increases pressure to preserve the nation\u2019s ability to supply domestic industry with the steel it needs.",
      "The Scunthorpe steel works operated by British Steel may soon run out of the iron pellets used to produce steel in two massive blast furnaces unless the government steps in, according to local politicians and unions. That\u2019s because the plant\u2019s owner, China\u2019s Jingye Group, canceled orders for these essential raw materials amid negotiations for increased government support.",
      "The news comes two weeks after British Steel said it was considering closing the blast furnaces because they are no longer financially sustainable due to \u201cchallenging market conditions,\u201d tariffs and increased environmental costs.",
      "The government is continuing negotiations with the company after Jingye rejected an offer of 500 million pounds ($640 million) to help modernize the plant. When asked on Tuesday what the government was prepared to do to keep the plant open, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was \u201cabsolutely committed\u201d to steel production in Britain.",
      "\u201cAll options are on the table in relation to Scunthorpe,\u201d he told a parliamentary committee.",
      "British Steel and its forebears have been making steel at Scunthorpe for more than 130 years, building on the U.K.\u2019s development of improved steelmaking technology during the Industrial Revolution. The plant currently employs about 2,700 people.",
      "Jingye bought British Steel in 2020 and says it has invested more than 1.2 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) to keep the plant running in the face of \u201congoing production instability.\u201d",
      "Nationwide, U.K. steel output has fallen 80% since the late 1960s due to high production costs and the rapid growth of Chinese production, which pushed down prices around the world.",
      "Britain, the world\u2019s fifth-largest steelmaker in 1970, produced just 5.6 million tons of steel in 2023, or 0.3% of global output. By comparison China produced 1.02 billion tons, or 54% of worldwide production.",
      "Britain\u2019s remaining steelmakers are now under pressure to reduce carbon emissions amid the threat of global warming. Most have shifted to electric arc furnaces that make steel from recycled material.",
      "That has left Scunthorpe as the only factory with blast furnaces capable of turning iron ore into virgin steel.",
      "Union officials say British Steel needs to order more iron pellets within the next few days to ensure delivery before the plant runs out of raw materials in late May.",
      "\u201cWe are in real threat of losing these furnaces,\u201d Thomas Smith, a steelworker and representative of the trade union Community, told Sky News this week. \u201cIf we miss them deadlines we\u2019ll come to a point where we\u2019ll have to make a decision whether we turn them both off,\u201d he added.",
      "During a debate in the House of Commons on Monday, lawmakers said Britain needed its own steelmaking industry to preserve its economic independence amid a burgeoning trade war fueled by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s new import tariffs.",
      "Martin Vickers, a member of Parliament who represents the area adjacent to Scunthorpe, said he believes Jingye isn\u2019t involved in \u201cmeaningful negotiations.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have come round to the view that nationalization on a temporary basis is, in this instance, the only way,\u201d he said Monday in the House of Commons. \u201cIt will secure the jobs and secure a future for steel production in Scunthorpe.\u201d",
      "Industry Minister Sarah Jones said Jingye was continuing to talk with the government.",
      "\u201cWe have been clear in our belief that the best way forward is for Scunthorpe and British Steel to continue as a commercially-run business with private investment and with the government acting in support,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I can tell the honorable gentleman that no options are off the table.\u201d",

      "Lego has opened a $1 billion factory in Vietnam that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy",
      "BINH DUONG, Vietnam -- Lego opened a $1 billion factory in Vietnam on Wednesday that it says will make toys without adding planet-warming gas to the atmosphere by relying entirely on clean energy.",
      "The factory in the industrial area of Binh Duong, close to Ho Chi Minh City, is the first in Vietnam that aims to run entirely on clean energy. Lego says it will do that by early 2026.",
      "It's the Danish company's sixth worldwide and its second in Asia. It will use high-tech equipment to produce colorful Lego bricks for Southeast Asia\u2019s growing markets.",
      "\u201cWe just want to make sure that the planet that the children inherit when they grow up needs to be a planet that is still there. That is functional,\u201d Lego CEO Niels Christiansen told The Associated Press.",
      "The factory is an important factor in Lego's quest to stop adding greenhouse gases by 2050. It has a shorter-term target of reducing emissions by 37% by 2032. The privately held group makes its bricks out of oil-based plastic and says it has invested more than $1.2 billion in a search for more sustainable alternatives. But those efforts have not always been successful.",
      "Fast-industrializing Vietnam also aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, so it needs more of its factories to use clean energy. The country hopes the plant\u2019s 12,400 solar panels and energy storage system will help set a precedent for more sustainable manufacturing.",
      "The blocks are made from differently colored plastic grains that are melted at high temperatures and then fed into metal molds. The highly-automated factory uses robots for making the bricks to a tenth of a hair's width precision and then packaging them. It eventually will employ thousands of mostly skilled workers to operate these machines, Some of them have already begun work after being trained in in Lego's factory in eastern China.",
      "Manufacturing makes up a fifth of Vietnam's GDP and consumes half the energy it uses. There are plans to phase out its coal power plants by 2040.",
      "The Lego factory, which spans 62 soccer fields, sets the \u201cblueprint\u201d for making large, power-guzzling factories sustainable while remaining profitable, said Mimi Vu, a founder of the consultancy Raise Partners in Ho Chi Minh City. \u201cSometimes it takes a big company, like Lego, to take those risks. To show that we can do it \u2026 And we can be profitable,\u201d she said.",
      "The factory will benefit from a new 2024 rule known as a direct power purchase agreement or DPPA, which allows big foreign companies to buy clean energy directly from solar and wind power producers and to meet their clean energy requirements.",
      "The factory will be linked to an adjacent energy center where electricity can be stored in large batteries.",
      "\u201cSo even if the sun is only shining during the day, we store the energy and can use it all over. That will cover by far the majority of the consumption of the factory,\u201d added Christiansen,",
      "The remaining 10%-20% of the factory's energy needs will be met through agreements with other clean energy producers.",
      "\u201cLego and Vietnam, we are having the same aspirations. We both want to be green, to play our part in the climate. And I think this with the solar and battery and DPPA, it is showcasing that it can be done,\u201d Jesper Hassellund Mikkelsen, Senior Vice President Asia Operations at the LEGO Group told The AP.",
      "The company will also open a distribution center in Vietnam's southern Dong Nai province to help serve markets in Australia and other Asian countries where it sees an opportunity for growth. Locating the Lego factories in regions they supply helps to insulate them from the tariffs ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump, Christiansen said.",
      "\u201cRight now, I am probably more observant of what does this mean to growth in the world? Do we see consumer sentiment changing in parts of the world or not, and what would that potentially mean?\" he said.",
      "The five buildings in the factory meet high energy efficiency standards. Lego also has planted 50,000 trees \u2013 twice the number of the trees it cut to clear land for the factory. It's the first Lego factory to replace single-use plastic bags with paper bags for packaging.",
      "Lego's founder, Ole Kirk Kristiansen, started the company as a wooden toy maker before patenting the iconic plastic bricks in 1958. It is still is seeking a way to make its plastic bricks more environmentally friendly.",
      "Christiansen said Lego bricks last decades and could be reused, though the ultimately ambition is to make them out of more renewable materials. He said that a third of the materials used in Lego bricks made last year were from renewable and recycled sources. But that's more expensive than plastic made out of fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not inexpensive at this point in time, but we believe if we ... lean into that, we help create a supply chain for the type of plastic materials that are not based on fossil fuel,\u201d he said.",

Two survivors were believed to have returned to North Korea, while Kim was the only one captured alive by South Korean forces.",
      "In a news conference arranged by South Korean authorities, Kim stunned the nation by saying that his team came \u201cto slit the throat of Park Chung-hee.\u201d",
      "The infiltration, which also killed about 30 South Koreans, happened at the height of Cold War rivalry between the rival Koreas which was split into the U.S.-backed South and the Soviet-supported North at the end of the World War II in 1945. After the incident, Park\u2019s government launched reservist forces, established a military unit tasked with attacking North Korea, had students take military training at schools and introduced residential registration card systems.",
      "In media interviews, Kim said he was pardoned because he didn\u2019t fire a single bullet during the shootouts and was persuaded by South Korean officials to disavow communism. He said South Korean intelligence authorities later had him travel across the country to make speeches critical of North Korean systems at schools, companies and other places.",
      "Kim said he later learned that his parents in North Korea were executed. Kim was ordained as a pastor in 1997.",
      "Kim said the 1968 attack was made at the order of North Korea founder and then leader Kim Il Sung, the late grandfather of current ruler Kim Jong Un. Kim Il Sung died of heart attack in 1994, handing over power to his son Kim Jong Il, the father of Kim Jong Un.",
      "\u201cI earlier didn\u2019t know why Kim Il Sung wanted to kill President Park,\u201d Kim Shin-jo said in a 2009 interview with South Korea's mass-circulation JoongAng Ilbo newspaper. \u201cBut I came to know the reason as I spent time here. Kim must have been afraid of a poor country such as South Korea becoming rich. As the economy improved, South Korea would secure more money to buy weapons. From Kim Il Sung\u2019s perspective, he couldn\u2019t help killing President Park to achieve communization of South Korea.\u201d",
      "But in a 2007 autobiography by Park Geun-hye, daughter of Park Chung-hee who became South Korea's first woman president in 2013, she said when she met Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2022, the younger Kim said the 1968 incident was orchestrated by \u201cextremists\u201d as he apologized for the incident. Park Geun-hye said Kim Jong Il told her that they all received unspecified due punishments.",
      "Kim Jong Il's reported comments couldn't be independently verified. Kim Jong Il died of heart attack in late 2011.",

      "SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic -- The number of victims who died after a roof collapsed at an iconic nightclub surged to 184 late Wednesday as dozens of people lingered outside the Dominican Republic\u2019s forensic institute for news of their loved ones still missing more than a day after disaster struck.",
      "Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez, director of the Center of Emergency Operations, said crews at the scene were still looking for victims and potential survivors, although no one has been found alive since Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cWe're not going to abandon anyone. Our work will continue,\u201d he said.",
      "Several blocks away from the rubble, people searching for friends and family donned face masks and began complaining about a bad odor as they pleaded with officials to give them information about their loved ones.",
      "Earlier in the day, National Institute of Forensic Pathology officials read the names of 54 victims they had identified so far.",
      "\u201cWe cannot wait until nighttime!\u201d said one woman who was waiting for news of a relative whose name she did not hear. \u201cWe're going to go crazy!\u201d",
      "Officials called for calm, saying they had already delivered at least 28 bodies to their families but did not yet have a tally of all the bodies recovered. Late Wednesday, officials raised the number of dead to at least 184, with over 200 injured.",
      "\u201cThe authorities are selling us false dreams!\u201d cried out Jos\u00e9 S\u00e1nchez, whose brother and brother-in-law were still missing.",
      "The legendary Jet Set club in Santo Domingo was packed with musicians, professional athletes and government officials when dust began falling from the ceiling and into people's drinks early Tuesday.",
      "Minutes later, the entire roof collapsed. Concrete slabs killed some instantly and trapped dozens of others on a dance floor where hundreds had been dancing to a lively merengue concert. In the minutes that followed, the country's 911 system received more than 100 calls, many from people buried under rubble.",
      "The victims include merengue icon Rubby P\u00e9rez, who had been singing to the crowd before disaster struck. His body was found early Wednesday, said emergency operations director Juan Manuel M\u00e9ndez.",
      "The government announced Wednesday evening that it was moving to a recovery phase focused on finding bodies after 145 people were rescued from the wreckage of the nightclub. Rescue crews from Puerto Rico and Israel had arrived early Wednesday to help with the search.",
      "Santo Domingo Mayor Carolina Mej\u00eda praised what she said were acts of love, including one Dominican who was handing out coffee to those at the scene and a man on vacation from Costa Rica who joined the search because he's part of a rescue crew back home.",
      "So far, only a few dozen people have been identified in one of the worst disasters to hit the Dominican Republic. Those who died include a cardiologist, a government architect, a retired police officer, a retired United Nations official, the son and daughter-in-law of the minister of public works and the brother of the vice minister of the Ministry of Youth.",
      "Also killed was former MLB pitcher Octavio Dotel and Dominican player Tony Enrique Blanco Cabrera, Satosky Terrero, spokesperson for the country\u2019s Professional Baseball League, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nelsy Cruz, the governor of the northwestern province of Montecristi and sister of seven-time Major League Baseball All-Star Nelson Cruz, alerted President Luis Abinader about the disaster. She called him from underneath the rubble but later died at a hospital.",
      "Other victims include saxophonist Luis Sol\u00eds, who was playing onstage when the roof fell; New York-based fashion designer Mart\u00edn Polanco; several Venezuelan bartenders; and an Army captain who left behind four young girls. Grupo Popular, a financial services company, said three of its employees also died, including the president of AFP Popular Bank and his wife. One man tearfully told reporters that he lost five relatives, including his wife and son.",
      "Dozens of victims remained unidentified.",
      "\u201cI have been to many hospitals, and I have not found her,\u201d Deysi Suriel said of her friend, 61-year-old Milca Curiel, a North Carolina resident who was on vacation in the Dominican Republic.",
      "Health Minister Dr. V\u00edctor El\u00edas Atallah Lajam announced the creation of a commission to provide psychological help for the victims\u2019 families.",
      "More than 20 of the injured remained hospitalized Wednesday, including at least eight in critical condition.",
      "\u201cA point in their favor is that they're young,\u201d said Dr. Julio Landr\u00f3n, director general of the Dr. Ney Arias Lora Trauma Hospital, which has 21 of the Jet Set injured, including five in critical condition.",
      "Landr\u00f3n warned, however, that none of them are in the clear, noting some suffered fractures in the skull, femur and pelvis.",
      "\u201cThey spent hours, more than six, seven, eight hours under rubble with multiple fractures, multiple injuries, with bleeding related to being crushed,\u201d he said.",
      "Dozens of frantic relatives listened to officials read aloud a list of the identified victims at the forensics institute, while others went from hospital to hospital looking for their loved ones, some clutching photographs.",
      "\u201cFrancisco Alberto M\u00e9ndez ... Rosa Herminia P\u00e9rez ... Ram\u00f3n Teodoro Jim\u00e9nez ... Juan Manuel Santana,\u201d one official read as the crowd strained to listen.",
      "\u201cHere! Here!\u201d yelled one person upon hearing the name of their loved one.",
      "In the crowd was Virginia Rosario, who was looking for relatives including her cousin, who is still missing, and her sister, Rosa Herminia P\u00e9rez, who died and whom she described as \u201cbeautiful, precious, very nice.\u201d",
      "\u201cI'm in a lot of pain,\u201d she said. \u201cI have had many moments of despair.\u201d",
      "Officials said late Wednesday morning that they had not been able to identify at least 33 bodies.",
      "\u201cThis is a very traumatic situation,\u201d said national lawmaker Pedro Mart\u00ednez, who also has relatives missing.",
      "Among those searching for friends and family was Kimberly Jones, whose godson, 45-year-old artist Osiris Blanc, and his friends were missing.",
      "\u201cIt was their favorite place, they went there almost every Monday,\u201d Jones said. She said her niece also was missing.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear what caused the roof to collapse, or when the Jet Set building was last inspected.",
      "The club issued a statement saying it was cooperating with authorities. A spokesperson for the family that owns the club told The Associated Press that she passed along questions about potential inspections.",
      "Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Works referred questions to the mayor\u2019s office. A spokesperson for the mayor\u2019s office did not respond to a request for comment.",

      "Founded in 2020, the group has coordinated sanctions on China over rights abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong and rallied support for Taiwan, a self-ruled democratic island Beijing claims as its territory.",
      "African politicians and experts say it\u2019s an escalation of Chinese diplomatic pressure in Africa, where Beijing's influence is growing. Beijing has built deep ties with African leaders by developing mines and building infrastructure through state-owned construction companies, often funded by loans from state-owned banks.",

Beijing has sanctioned some members and last year, lawmakers from at least six countries were pressured by Chinese diplomats not to attend the group\u2019s summit in Taiwan.

      "President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump delivered another jarring reversal in American trade policy Wednesday, suspending for 90 days import taxes he\u2019d imposed barely 13 hours earlier on dozens of countries while escalating his trade war with China. The moves triggered a powerful stock market rally on Wall Street but left businesses, investors and America\u2019s trading partners bewildered about what the president is attempting to achieve.",
      "The U-turn came after the sweeping global tariffs Trump announced last week set off a four-day route in global financial markets, paralyzed businesses and raised fears the U.S. and world economies would tumble into recession.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt tried to characterize the sudden change in policy as part of a grand negotiating strategy. But to those outside the Trump administration, it looked like a cave-in to market pressure and to growing fears that the president\u2019s impetuous use of import taxes -- tariffs -- would cause massive collateral economic damage.",
      "\u201cOther countries will welcome the 90-day stay of execution \u2014 if it lasts \u2014 but the whiplash from constant zig-zags creates more of the uncertainty that businesses and governments hate,\u201d said Daniel Russel, vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute. \u201cThe Administration\u2019s blunt-force tactics have rattled allies, who see the sudden reversal as damage control following the market meltdown, rather than a pivot to respectful, balanced negotiations.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump\u2019s turnaround Wednesday capped a wild week in U.S. trade policy. On Wednesday April 2 \u2014 which Trump labeled \u201cLiberation Day\u2019\u2019 \u2014 the president announced plans to impose tariffs on almost every country on earth, upending the world trading system. The first of his new tariffs -\u2013 a 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tax on imports from most countries \u2013 went into effect Saturday.",
      "At midnight Wednesday, he upped the ante by slapping what he called \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 taxes on countries he accused of unfair trading practices and adding to U.S. trade deficits. Those are the tariffs he suspended for 90 days, saying the pause would give countries time to negotiate with him and his trade team.",
      "There was one exception to the reprieve: He raised the tariff on Chinese imports to a staggering 125%, punishing Beijing for announcing retaliatory tariffs on the United States. Meanwhile, the 10% baseline tariffs \u2013 a substantial act of protectionism in their own right \u2013 remain in place.",
      "Trump\u2019s ever-changing trade war tactics \u2014 which include earlier levies on cars, steel and aluminum, and Mexico and Canada \u2014 have already done damage, forcing dazed companies to delay or cancel plans as they tried to figure out what Trump was doing and how they should respond.",
      "Some companies temporarily laid off workers after Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs were announced, while there were signs that many firms held off on hiring amid the widespread uncertainty the tariffs created.",
      "Carmaker Stellantis temporarily cut 900 jobs at factories in Michigan and Indiana after production was halted at two plants in Canada and Mexico in the wake of Trump's 25% duties on imported cars.",
      "And Cleveland-Cliffs laid off 1,200 workers at a factory in Michigan and an iron ore mine in Minnesota in response to a drop in demand from auto companies. Cleveland-Cliffs said it would resume production at the two facilities once auto production returned to the U.S.",
      "Minutes from the Federal Reserve\u2019s March 18-19 meeting, released Wednesday, showed that many of its policymakers said that their business contacts \u201creported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty.\"",
      "And Delta Air Lines said earlier Wednesday that demand for domestic leisure trips and corporate travel has stalled because of the uncertainty around global trade. In a conference call with investors, the company said it was cutting capacity. It also declined to provide a full-year financial forecast.",
      "\u201cRight now, it\u2019s hard to know how this is going to play out, given that this is somewhat self-imposed,\u201d Delta CEO Ed Bastian said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that sanity will prevail and we\u2019ll move through this period of time on the global trade front relatively quickly.\u201d",
      "Businesses have sought greater clarity around Trump's ultimate tariff policies for weeks. It's not clear that the 90-day pause has reduced their uncertainty.",
      "Jeff Jaisli, CEO of the New Jersey-based importer/exporter Jagro, said Trump\u2019s Truth Social post on Wednesday had made things \u201ceven worse\u2019\u2019 and more confusing. He was trying to figure out which tariffs applied to which countries.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re scrambling to find correct information and procedures for entries we\u2019re processing NOW in real time,\u2019\u2019 he said by email. He could find no guidance on the websites of the White House or the Customs and Border Protection agency, which collects tariffs. Earlier, Jaisli called Trump's tariffs \"a grenade that was thrown into the room that\u2019s going to cause chaos.''",
      "Trump's tariffs have set off a tit-for-tat trade war with China, the world's second-biggest economy. Even before Trump upped his taxes on China to 125%, the Chinese had set their own tariffs on the United States at 84%.",
      "The World Trade Organization's director-general, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, warned that the rising tension could reduce U.S.-China merchandise trade by 80% and \"severely damage the global economic outlook.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf particular concern is the potential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines,\u201d she wrote in a statement late Wednesday. \u201cA division of the global economy into two blocs could lead to a long-term reduction in global real GDP by nearly 7%.\u201d",
      "Citing WTO projections, she warned the negative effects could ripple through to other economies, especially developing ones. She urged countries to ensure an open global trading system and resolve differences through cooperation.",
      "Meanwhile, U.S. companies struggled to figure out how to respond to huge levies on Chinese products they'd come to rely on.",
      "Jessica Bettencourt is CEO of Klem\u2019s, a third-generation store in Spencer, Massachusetts that sells everything from lawn and garden items to workwear and gifts. She said that the escalation of tariffs from China have made her stop ordering any new fourth-quarter product that is holiday, gifts or toys. She is also reconsidering any fall apparel and footwear orders that aren\u2019t already placed.",
      "\u201cThe worst thing is uncertainty and we have massive uncertainty,\u201d said Jason Goldberg, chief commerce strategy officer at Publicis Groupe, a global marketing and communications company. \u201cNo one can make any moves. Everybody is trying to save as much cash and defer any unnecessary expense. People are getting laid off. Orders are getting cancelled. Expansion plans are being put on hold.\u201d",

      "Bulls, bears and dead cats are lurking in the background of President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war",
      "NEW YORK -- Bulls, bears and dead cats are lurking in the background of President Donald Trump's trade war. As the effects of the administration's latest tariffs unfold, news consumers may confront unfamiliar terms related to investments or financial markets. Here is a guide to some of the most common words:",
      "A bear market is a term used by Wall Street when an index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 20% or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time.",
      "Why use a bear to refer to a market slump? Bears hibernate, so they represent a stock market in retreat. In contrast, Wall Street\u2019s nickname for a surging market is a bull market, because bulls charge.",
      "When stocks rebound briefly in a moment of free fall or uncertainty, it's known as a \u201cdead cat bounce.\" That's from the notion that even a dead cat will bounce when it falls from a great enough height. The market recovery tends to be temporary and brief, and the downturn tends to resume.",
      "Capitulation refers to the point when investors give up on the idea of recouping their losses and sell, often out of fear and intolerance of falling prices. This tends to happen during times of low confidence and high uncertainty and volatility.",
      "Capitulation can sometimes indicate the bottom of a market, but it's easier to identify in retrospect.",
      "A recession is a time when the economy shrinks and unemployment rises.",
      "Recessions are officially declared by the obscure-sounding National Bureau of Economic Research, a group of economists who consider factors such as hiring trends, income levels, spending, retail sales and factory output. The bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee defines a recession as \u201ca significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months.\u201d",
      "The organization typically does not declare a recession until well after one has begun, sometimes as long as a year later.",
      "In the days before Trump\u2019s most recent tariffs took effect, economists at Goldman Sachs raised their assessment of the odds the U.S. will experience a recession from 35% to as high as 65%, but the analysts rescinded that forecast Wednesday after his administration announced a 90-day pause on most of the levees.",
      "\"Buying the dip\u201d refers to purchasing a stock or buying into the market right after it has lost value, at a discount. The phrase is commonly used by retail investors. Unfortunately, it's all but impossible to time the market, to know where the bottom will be or how long a recovery will take.",
      "The 10-year Treasury bond yield is the interest rate the U.S. government pays to borrow money for a decade. It's a key indicator of investor sentiment and economic conditions, and it helps set prices for all kinds of other loans and investments. The yield influences borrowing costs and signals expectations about inflation and economic growth.",
      "Historically, Treasury bonds are considered one of the world's safest assets. That means investors often buy them when there's uncertainty in the market, which tends to lower the yield. Prices for the 10-year bonds tend to fall when confidence is high (and people buy assets perceived as riskier), which causes yields to rise.",
      "In recent days, however, investors have sold Treasury bonds, which has sent the benchmark 10-year yield up. That could point to a lack of consumer confidence in Treasury bonds themselves, or any number of other factors.",
      "___",
      "Associated Press writers Stan Choe, Alex Veiga and Chris Rugaber contributed to this report.",

      "Oil prices slid to a four-year low Wednesday as fears of a global recession grew amid the latest round of tariff increases",
      "WASHINGTON -- Oil prices slumped to a four-year low Wednesday in anticipation of slowing economic growth and reduced energy demand, both casualties of a trade war that began after President Donald Trump ordered widespread tariffs against the imports of U.S. trading partners.",
      "U.S. benchmark crude fell 4.3% to $56.98 per barrel in midday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices had fallen further earlier in the day to levels not seen since February 2021, the depth of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Energy prices have fallen remarkably fast, with the cost of a barrel of oil sliding by more than $20 since the start of the year. At this time last year, a barrel of U.S. crude cost $85, or 34% more than it does now. A barrel was going for around $71 at the beginning of April, before tariffs were launched.",
      "Brent crude, the European standard, fell $2.36 to $60.46 per barrel.",
      "The most recent swoon in energy prices arrived when Trump\u2019s latest round of tariffs  kicked in after midnight, including a 104% tax on goods coming from China. The world\u2019s second-largest economy quickly retaliated, with Beijing saying it would raise tariffs on imported U.S. goods to 84% on Thursday.",
      "European Union member states followed suit, issuing retaliatory tariffs on $23 billion in goods. For now, the targeted items are a tiny fraction of the 1.6 trillion euros ($1.8 trillion) in U.S.-EU annual trade.",

      "Facing a global market meltdown, President Donald Trump on Wednesday abruptly backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days, but raised his tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%",
      "WASHINGTON -- Facing a global market meltdown, President Donald Trump on Wednesday abruptly backed off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days even as he further jacked up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "It was seemingly an attempt to narrow what had been an unprecedented trade war between the U.S. and most of the world to a showdown between the U.S. and China. The S&P 500 stock index jumped 9.5% after the announcement, but the drama over Trump's tariffs is far from over as the administration prepares to engage in country-by-country negotiations. In the meantime, countries subject to the pause will now be tariffed at 10%.",
      "The president hit pause in the face of intense pressure created by volatile financial markets that had been pushing Trump to reconsider his tariffs, even as some administration officials insisted the his reversal had always been the plan.",
      "As stocks and bonds sold off, voters were watching their retirement savings dwindle and businesses warned of worse than expected sales and rising prices, all a possible gut punch to a country that sent Trump back to the White House last year on the promise of combatting inflation.",
      "The global economy appeared to be in open rebellion against Trump\u2019s tariffs as they took effect early Wednesday, a signal that the U.S. president was not immune from market pressures. By early afternoon, Trump posted on Truth Social that because more than 75 countries had reached out to the U.S. government for trade talks and had not retaliated in meaningful ways, \u201cI have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\u201d",
      "Trump later told reporters that he pulled back on many global tariffs \u2014 but not on China \u2014 because people were \u201cyippy\u201d and \u201cafraid\" due to the stock market declines. He added that while he expected to reach deals, \u201cnothing\u2019s over yet.\u201d",
      "The president said he had been monitoring the bond market and that people were \u201cgetting a little queasy\" as bond prices had fallen and interest rates had increased in a vote of no confidence by investors in Trump's previous tariff plans.",
      "\u201cThe bond market is very tricky,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI was watching it. But if you look at it now, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d",
      "The president later said he'd been thinking about his tariff pause over the past few days, but he said it \u201ccame together early this morning, fairly early this morning.\u201d",
      "Asked why White House aides had been insisting for weeks that the tariffs were not part of a negotiation, Trump said: \u201cA lot of times, it\u2019s not a negotiation until it is.\u201d",
      "The 10% tariff was the baseline rate for most nations that went into effect on Saturday. It's meaningfully lower than the 20% tariff that Trump had set for goods from the European Union, 24% on imports from Japan and 25% on products from South Korea. Still, 10% represents an increase in the tariffs previously charged by the U.S. government. Canada and Mexico would continue to be tariffed by as much as 25% due to a separate directive by Trump to ostensibly stop fentanyl smuggling.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the negotiations with individual countries would be \u201cbespoke,\u201d meaning that the next 90 days would involve talks on a flurry of potential deals. Bessent, a former hedge fund manager, told reporters that the pause was because of other countries seeking talks rather than brutal selloffs in the financial markets, a statement later contradicted by the president.",
      "\u201cThe only certainty we can provide is that the U.S. is going to negotiate in good faith, and we assume that our allies will too,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "The treasury secretary said he and Trump \u201chad a long talk on Sunday, and this was his strategy all along\u201d and that the president had \u201cgoaded China into a bad position.\u201d",
      "Prior to the reversal, business executives were warning of a potential recession caused by his policies, some of the top U.S. trading partners were retaliating with their own import taxes and the stock market was quivering after days of decline.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the walk back was part of Trump\u2019s negotiating strategy.",
      "She said the news media \"clearly failed to see what President Trump is doing here. You tried to say that the rest of the world would be moved closer to China, when in fact, we\u2019ve seen the opposite effect. The entire world is calling the United States of America, not China, because they need our markets.\u201d",
      "The head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, said the trade war between the U.S. and China could \u201ccould severely damage the global economic outlook\" and warned of \u201cpotential fragmentation of global trade along geopolitical lines.\u201d",
      "Market turmoil had been building for weeks ahead of Trump's move, with the president at times suggesting the import taxes would stay in place while also saying that they could be subject to negotiations.",
      "Particularly worrisome was that U.S. government debt had lost some of its luster with investors, who usually treat Treasury notes as a safe haven when there's economic turbulence. Government bond prices had been falling, pushing up the interest rate on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note to 4.45%. That rate eased after Trump's reversal.",
      "Gennadiy Goldberg, head of U.S. rates strategy at TD Securities, said before the announcement that markets wanted to see a truce in the trade disputes.",
      "\u201cMarkets more broadly, not just the Treasury market, are looking for signs that a trade de-escalation is coming,\" he said. \"Absent any de-escalation, it\u2019s going to be difficult for markets to stabilize.\u201d",
      "John Canavan, lead analyst at the consultancy Oxford Economics, noted that while Trump said he changed course due to possible negotiations, he had previously indicated that the tariffs would stay in place.",
      "\u201cThere have been very mixed messages on whether there would be negotiations,\" Canavan said. \"Given what's been going on with the markets, he realized the safest thing to do is negotiate and put things on pause.\u201d",
      "The whipsaw-like nature of Wednesday could be seen in the social media posts of Bill Ackman, a hedge fund billionaire and Trump supporter.",
      "\u201cOur stock market is down,\u201d Ackman posted on X. \u201cBond yields are up and the dollar is declining. These are not the markers of successful policy.\u201d",
      "Ackman repeated his call for a 90-day pause in the post. When Trump embraced that idea several hours later, an ebullient Ackman posted that Trump had \u201cbrilliantly executed\u201d his plan and it was \u201cTextbook, Art of the Deal,\u201d a reference to Trump's bestselling 1987 book.",
      "Presidents often receive undue credit or blame for the state of the U.S. economy as their time in the White House is subject to financial and geopolitical forces beyond their direct control.",
      "But by unilaterally imposing tariffs, Trump has exerted extraordinary influence over the flow of commerce, creating political risks and pulling the market in different directions based on his remarks and social media posts. There still appear to be 25% tariffs on autos, steel and aluminum, with more imports, including pharmaceutical drugs, set to be tariffed in the weeks ahead.",
      "The tariffs frenzy of recent weeks has taken its toll on businesses and individuals alike.",
      "On CNBC, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said the administration was being less strategic than it was during Trump's first term. His company had in January projected it would have its best financial year in history, only to scrap its expectations for 2025 due to the economic uncertainty.",
      "\u201cTrying to do it all at the same time has created chaos in terms of being able to make plans,\u201d he said, noting that demand for air travel has weakened.",
      "Before Trump's reversal, economic forecasters said his second term has had a series of negative and cascading impacts that could put the country into a downturn.",
      "\u201cSimultaneous shocks to consumer sentiment, corporate confidence, trade, financial markets as well as to prices, new orders and the labor market will tip the economy into recession in the current quarter,\u201d said Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at the consultancy RSM.",
      "Bessent has previously said it could take months to strike deals with countries on tariff rates. But in a Wednesday morning appearance on \u201cMornings with Maria,\u201d Bessent said the economy would \u201cbe back to firing on all cylinders\u201d at a point in the \u201cnot too distant future.\u201d",
      "He said there has been an \"overwhelming\" response by \u201cthe countries who want to come and sit at the table rather than escalate.\u201d Bessent mentioned Japan, South Korea, and India. \"I will note that they are all around China. We have Vietnam coming today,\u201d he said.",

An 18-ounce bottle of Lee Kum Kee Panda oyster sauce, for example, retails for $3.99 at 99 Ranch. The websites for Safeway and Walmart list the same bottle for $4.79 and $10.45, respectively.",
      "The stores stocking a wide range of noodles, dried vegetables, herbs and skin care products from China, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam can be a source of comfort for immigrants and foreign students craving the tastes of home.",
      "Tony He, an international student at UCLA, said Trump's tariff policies confused him but he would continue shopping at 99 Ranch to get his groceries if prices increase. \u201cAs long as I need Asian food, I usually come here,\u201d He said.",
      "Shopping for culturally specific foods, drinks and condiments in the U.S. has come a long way from the once-meager offerings found in the \u201cethnic food\u201d aisles of American supermarkets. International supermarkets and small grocery stores across the country generated $55.8 billion in revenue last year, according to market research firm IBISWorld.",
      "The sector has recorded an annual growth rate of roughly 3% since 2019, and an IBISWorld forecast predicted revenue for grocery stores with international brands would go up to over $64 billion by 2029.",
      "Analysts attribute the increase in demand to the growth of Asian and Hispanic immigrant populations, as well as to the tastes of younger consumers who enjoy experiencing new flavors. Mass market stores and brands increasingly have stocked or created Americanized versions of Asian products to ride the trend.",
      "The specialty rice used for sushi that mainstream supermarkets sell also is usually imported from South Korea, China or Japan, noted Nancy Qian, a professor of economics at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management. She thinks tariffs may lead consumers to find alternatives for their favorite brands.",
      "\u201cWhen my parents first came to America in the '80s from China, they couldn\u2019t really get the same type of rice as they did in China, So they switched to a different type of rice,\u201d Qian said. \u201cI think families and restaurants and people, they\u2019ll do what it takes to make ends meet. And they\u2019ll substitute foods. They\u2019ll buy new foods.\u201d",
      "Independent shops that are integral to smaller Asian American communities are also bracing for a hit. The owner of Not Just Spices, a tiny South Asian grocery in Providence, Rhode Island, said he was concerned about costs rising costs for everyday products such as basmati rice sourced from India and Pakistan, or the smaller-grained Kalijira rice from his native Bangladesh.",
      "\u201cWhen things are cheaper, people usually buy extra. Now they buy exactly what they need,\u201d said Mohammed Islam, who has run Not Just Spices since 1998. \u201cPeople are scared of spending any money because they don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be happening.\u201d",
      "Trump announced a tariff of 37% on goods from Bangladesh, 26% on neighboring India's products, 29% on items from Pakistan and a whopping 44% on imports from the island country of Sri Lanka, known for its cinnamon and other spices.",
      "If he does have to raise prices as the tariff\u2019s impacts start to hit supplies, Islam trusts his customers won\u2019t blame him.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t complain because it\u2019s already in the news,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m the one who is raising the price.\u201d",
      "Customers at Hispanic supermarkets also may be shopping more carefully. Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose a 25% tariff on most imports from Mexico.",
      "In Phoenix, roommates Andrew Colvin and Mario Aviles typically patronize Los Altos Ranch Market, where they say the bulk of the produce and snacks they buy are from Mexico. The sprawling supermarket, which includes a deli and a bakery, is one of the 115 stores the Heritage Grocers Group operates in six states.",
      "\u201cWe expect pretty much everything to go up,\u201d said Colvin, who was stocking up on Parrot canned coconut water, his favorite drink, in case the price goes up. \u201cI probably eat 14 avocados a week. There\u2019ll be a lot less of that.\u201d",
      "Aviles doesn\u2019t want to shop elsewhere. If tariffs result in serious sticker shock, he is prepared to restrict himself instead.",
      "\u201cNo more avocados, no more mangoes, no more orange,\u201d Aviles said.",
      "Some experts say it wouldn\u2019t hurt to stock up on non-perishables within limits and individual household budgets. But shoppers need to avoid the \u201cpanic buying\u201d that accompanied the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could create shortages and cause additional price increases, Qian said.",
      "While it's not yet clear how much of the tariffs will get passed onto U.S. consumers, researchers say any price increases would disproportionately affect low-income households.",
      "\u201cThese are regressive taxes. And for the elementary reason that affluent people do not spend 100% of their incomes and disadvantaged people do,\u201d Steven Durlauf, director of the University of Chicago's Stone Center for Research on Wealth Inequality and Mobility.",
      "Northwestern University's Qian said the cumulative economic impacts of Trump administration tariffs may hold one possible silver lining if they bring people back to the cultural enclaves of major cities.",
      "\u201cIf you think about the old Chinatowns, or the old, like, Little Italys of America,\u201d she said. \u201cThe reason that those places became really important for their communities was because that was the only place where you can get the thing you wanted.\u201d",

      "Delta has pulled its 2025 guidance as the trade war scrambles expectations and said it will reduce capacity given economic conditions",
      "Delta Airlines pulled its guidance for 2025 Wednesday as the trade war scrambles expectations for business and household spending and depresses bookings across the travel sector.",
      "\u201cWith broad economic uncertainty around global trade, growth has largely stalled,\" CEO Ed Bastian said in a statement on Wednesday. \"In this slower-growth environment, we are protecting margins and cash flow by focusing on what we can control. This includes reducing planned capacity growth in the second half of the year to flat over last year while actively managing costs and capital expenditures.\u201d",
      "In the first quarter, Delta earned $240 million, or 37 cents per share. A year earlier it earned $37 million, or 6 cents per share.",
      "Stripping out certain items, earnings were 46 cents per share. That's better than the 40 cents per share analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research predicted.",
      "Shares of Delta Air Lines Inc. were flat before the opening bell. But the sector has been battered this year as investors, anticipating trouble from rising tariffs, put their money elsewhere. Shares are down 41% this year for the nation's most profitable airline, which is better than rivals American and United.",
      "Quarterly operating revenue climbed to $14.04 billion from $13.75 billion, beating Wall Street's estimate of $13.81 billion.",
      "The average fuel price per gallon declined to $2.47 from $2.79.",
      "Delta cut its first-quarter earnings and revenue outlook last month, saying at the time that a recent decline in consumer and corporate confidence amid growing uncertainty over the economy was weakening domestic demand.",
      "Delta said in March that it expected first-quarter revenue to rise between 3% and 4% compared with a year earlier, down from projections of 7% and 9%.",
      "In January, Delta released fourth-quarter results that topped Wall Street\u2019s profit and revenue estimates, as the company benefited from strong demand during the crucial holiday period.",
      "Yet conditions have deteriorated since then with a burgeoning trade war leaving consumers and businesses unsure about what comes next. Both have begun to pull back on spending, and that includes travel.",
      "Bastian said Delta foresees June quarter profitability of $1.5 to $2 billion but will not update its full-year outlook \u201cgiven the lack of economic clarity.\u201d",
      "The airline previously said that it expected 2025 earnings of more than $7.35 per share and free cash flow of more than $4 billion. At the time the company was expecting strong travel demand to continue.",
      "A month ago Bastian affirmed the company's full-year guidance. Speaking at the JPMorgan Industrial Conference, the executive said at the time that Delta was feeling good about where it was at.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing that we\u2019ve been through these last couple of months to indicate there\u2019s any cracks in any of this,\u201d he said. \u201cWe anticipate margins continuing to expand and we think margins will expand this year, even with the slower start to the year.\u201d",
      "But Bastian also noted that Delta would continue to monitor the situation and would make adjustments to its outlook if needed.",

      "BERLIN -- Conservative and center-left parties reached a deal to form a new German government on Wednesday after weeks of negotiations. The agreement paves the way for new leadership in Europe\u2019s biggest economy after months of political drift.",
      "Friedrich Merz, the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union, is expected to become Germany\u2019s next leader under the agreement, replacing outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz. The parties involved sent an invitation to a news conference on the coalition deal at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT).",
      "Merz\u2019s two-party Union bloc emerged as the strongest force from Germany\u2019s election on Feb. 23. Merz turned to the Social Democrats, Scholz\u2019s center-left party, to put together a coalition with a parliamentary majority.",
      "It\u2019s still going to be a little while before parliament can elect Merz as chancellor, perhaps in early May. Before that can happen, the coalition deal will need approval in a ballot of the Social Democrats\u2019 membership and by a convention of Merz\u2019s CDU.",
      "Details of the agreement weren\u2019t immediately available.",
      "But already last month, the two sides pushed plans through parliament to enable higher defense spending by loosening strict rules on incurring debt and to set up a huge infrastructure fund that\u2019s aimed at boosting the stagnant economy.",

      "So have polls showing support for the Union slipping from its election showing and that of the far-right Alternative for Germany, which finished a strong second in February, gaining as the political vacuum persisted.",
      "The prospective new coalition brings together what have been post-World War II Germany\u2019s traditional big parties, but the Union\u2019s election-winning performance in February was lackluster and the Social Democrats dropped to their worst postwar showing in a national parliamentary election.",
      "Together, they have 328 seats in the 630-member lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.",

      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with a bevy of worries about the economic impacts of the president\u2019s sweeping tariff strategy",
      "WASHINGTON -- Manufacturers struggling to make long-term plans. Farmers facing retaliation from Chinese buyers. U.S. households burdened with higher prices.",
      "Republican senators are confronting the Trump administration with those worries and many more as they fret about the economic impact of the president's sweeping tariff strategy that went into effect Wednesday.",
      "In a Senate hearing and interviews with reporters this week, Republican skepticism of President Donald Trump's policies ran unusually high. While GOP lawmakers made sure to direct their concern at Trump's aides and advisers \u2014 particularly U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who appeared before the Senate Finance Committee Tuesday \u2014 it still amounted to a rare Republican break from a president they have otherwise championed.",
      "Lawmakers had reason to worry: the stock market has been in a volatile tumble for days and economists are warning that the plans could lead to a recession.",
      "\"Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves to be wrong?\u201d Republican Sen. Thom Tillis told Greer as he pressed for an answer on which Trump aide to hold accountable if there is an economic downturn.",
      "Tillis' frustration was aimed at the across-the-board tariff strategy that could potentially hamstring U.S. manufacturers who are currently dependent on materials like aluminum and steel from China. His home state of North Carolina, where he is up for reelection next year, has attracted thousands of foreign firms looking to invest in the state's manufacturing industries.",
      "Ever wary of crossing Trump, Republicans engaged in a delicate two-step of criticizing the rollout of the tariffs then shifting to praise for the president's economic vision. In the afternoon, Tillis in a Senate floor speech said that the \u201cpresident is right in challenging other nations who have for decades abused their relationship with the United States,\" yet went on to question who in the White House was thinking through the long-term economic effects of the sweeping tariffs.",
      "Tillis even allowed that Trump's trade strategy could still turn out to be effective, but said there is a short window to show that it is worth the higher prices and layoffs that will burden workers.",
      "For his part, Greer emphasized to the committee that the U.S. was engaged in negotiations with other countries but that \u201cthe trade deficit has been decades in the making, and it's not going to be solved overnight.\u201d",
      "Republican leaders in Congress, as well as a sizeable chunk of lawmakers, have emphasized that Trump needs time to implement his strategy. They've mostly rejected the idea of putting a check on Trump's tariff power, but it is clear that anxiety is growing among rank-and-file Republicans about what's ahead.",
      "Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, said there is a company in his state that had spent \u201cmillions of dollars\" moving its parts production from China to Vietnam. But now that Vietnam is facing steep tariffs, the business is unable to move forward with negotiating prices with retailers.",
      "Lankford pressed Greer for a timeline for negotiations, but the trade representative responded, \u201cWe don\u2019t have any particular timeline. The outcome is more important than setting something artificially for us.\u201d",
      "Trade agreements between countries typically take months or even years to work out and often require the parties to navigate through a host of legal, economic and business issues. Still, Republicans said they were encouraged by the indications that Trump is entering into negotiations with other nations.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Montana Republican, said at the committee hearing that he was \u201cvery encouraged\u201d by news of trade negotiations and attributed a momentary upward tick in the stock market to \u201chope that these tariffs are a means and not solely an end.\u201d",
      "He told Greer, \"Who pays these high tariffs? It will be the consumer. I\u2019m worried about the inflationary effect. I\u2019m worried if there is a trade war that we\u2019re going to have markets shutting down for American farmers, ranchers and manufacturers.\u201d",
      "Other GOP lawmakers contended that the pain was worth bearing. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a member of the conservative Freedom Caucus, said the president is on the right track.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pain, but it\u2019s going to be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president will make the right call. He\u2019s doing the right thing.\u201d",
      "Still, traditional Republicans were looking for ways to push back on Trump's tariff plan.",
      "Sen. Chuck Grassley, a senior Republican, has introduced a bipartisan bill to give Congress the power to review and approve of new tariffs, and Republican members in the House were also working to gain support for a similar bill. Such legislation would allow Congress to claw back some of its constitutional power over tariff policy, which has been almost completely handed over to the president in recent decades through legislation.",
      "But the White House has already indicated that Trump would veto the bill, and both Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., have said they are not interested in bringing it up for a vote.",
      "Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican closely aligned with Trump, said on social media that the bill was a bad idea because \u201cCongress moves at the pace of a tortoise running a race.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe reason why Congress gave this authority to the president to begin with is because the ability to pivot,\u201d he added.",
      "But the president's unclear messaging has also left lawmakers only guessing as they try to decipher which advisers and aides hold sway in the White House.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said that as he\u2019s received calls from the business community in his state, he\u2019s had no answers for them besides telling them the prospects for the economy are uncertain.

      "By declaring a trade war on the rest of the world, President Donald Trump has panicked global financial markets and raised the risk of a recession",
      "WASHINGTON -- By declaring a trade war on the rest of the world, President Donald Trump has panicked global financial markets, raised the risk of a recession and broken the political and economic alliances that made much of the world stable for business after World War II.",
      "Trump's latest round of tariffs went into full effect at midnight Wednesday, with higher import tax rates on dozens of countries and territories taking hold.",
      "Economists are puzzled to see Trump trying to overhaul the existing economic order and doing it so soon after inheriting the strongest economy in the world. Many of the trading partners he accuses of ripping off U.S. businesses and workers were already floundering.",
      "\u201cThere is a deep irony in Trump claiming unfair treatment of the American economy at a time when it was growing robustly while every other major economy had stalled or was losing growth momentum,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \u201cIn an even greater irony, the Trump tariffs are likely to end America\u2019s remarkable run of success and crash the economy, job growth and financial markets.\u2019\u2019",
      "Trump and his trade advisers insist that the rules governing global commerce put the United States at a distinct disadvantage. But mainstream economists \u2014 whose views Trump and his advisers disdain \u2014 say the president has a warped idea of world trade, especially a preoccupation with trade deficits, which they say do nothing to impede growth.",
      "The administration accuses other countries of erecting unfair trade barriers to keep out American exports and using underhanded tactics to promote their own. In Trump\u2019s telling, his tariffs are a long-overdue reckoning: The U.S. is the victim of an economic mugging by Europe, China, Mexico, Japan and even Canada.",
      "It's true that some countries charge higher taxes on imports than the United States does. Some manipulate their currencies lower to ensure that their goods are price-competitive in international markets. Some governments lavish their industries with subsidies to give them an edge.",
      "However, the United States is still the second-largest exporter in the world, after China. The U.S. exported $3.1 trillion of goods and services in 2023, far ahead of third-place Germany at $2 trillion.",
      "The fear that Trump\u2019s remedies are deadlier than the maladies he\u2019s trying to cure has sent investors fleeing American stocks. Since Trump announced sweeping import taxes on April 2, the S&P 500 has cratered 12%.",
      "Trump and his advisers point to America\u2019s lopsided trade numbers \u2014 year after year of huge deficits \u2014 as proof of foreigners\u2019 perfidy. He\u2019s seeking to restore justice and millions of long-gone U.S. factory jobs by taxing imports at rates not seen in America since the days of the horse and buggy.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve taken so much of our wealth away from us,\u201d the president declared last week at a White House Rose Garden ceremony to celebrate the tariffs announcement. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let that happen. We truly can be very wealthy. We can be so much wealthier than any country.\u2019\u2019",
      "But the U.S. is already the wealthiest major economy in the world. And the International Monetary Fund in January forecast that the United States would outgrow every other major advanced economy this year.",
      "China and India did grow faster than the United States over the past decade, but their living standards still don\u2019t come close to those in the U.S.",
      "Manufacturing in the U.S. has been fading for decades. There is widespread agreement that many American manufacturers couldn\u2019t compete with an influx of cheap imports after China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. Factories closed, workers were laid off and heartland communities withered.",
      "Four years later, nearly 3 million manufacturing jobs had been lost, though robots and other forms of automation probably did at least as much to reduce factory jobs as the \u201cChina shock.\u2019\u2019",
      "To turn around this long decline, Trump has repeatedly unsheathed the tariffs that are his weapon of choice. Since returning to the White House in January, he\u2019s plastered 25% taxes on foreign cars, steel and aluminum. He\u2019s hit Chinese imports with 20% levies, on top of hefty tariffs he imposed on China during his first term.",
      "On April 2, he blasted his big bazooka: 10% \u201cbaseline\u2019\u2019 tariffs on just about everybody and \u201creciprocal\u2019\u2019 tariffs on everyone else that the Trump team identified as bad actors, including tiny Lesotho (a 50% import tax) and China (34% before adding earlier levies).",
      "Trump views tariffs as an all-purpose economic fix that will protect American industries, encourage companies to open factories in America, raise money for the U.S. Treasury and give him leverage to bend other countries to his will, even on issues that have nothing to do with trade, such as drug trafficking and immigration.",
      "The president also sees a smoking gun: The United States has bought more from other countries than it has sold them every year for the past half-century. In 2024, the U.S. trade deficit in goods and services came to a whopping $918 billion, the second-highest amount on record.",
      "Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro calls America\u2019s trade deficits \u201cthe sum of all cheating\u2019\u2019 by other countries.",
      "However, economists say trade deficits aren\u2019t a sign of national weakness. The U.S. economy has nearly quadrupled in size, adjusted for inflation, during that half-century of trade deficits.",
      "\u201cThere is no reason to think that a bigger trade deficit means lower growth,\" said former IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics and an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIn fact, the opposite is closer to the truth in many countries.\"",
      "A trade deficit, Obstfeld said, does not mean a country is losing through trade or being \"ripped off.\"",
      "The faster the U.S. economy grows, in fact, the more imports Americans tend to buy and the wider the trade deficit tends to get. The U.S. trade deficit \u2014 the gap between what it sells and what it buys from foreign countries \u2014 hit a record $945 billion in 2022 as the American economy roared back from COVID-19 lockdowns. Trade deficits typically fall sharply in recessions.",
      "Nor are trade deficits primarily inflicted on America by other countries\u2019 unfair trading practices. To economists, they\u2019re a homegrown product, the result of Americans' propensity to save little and consume more than they produce.",
      "American shoppers' famous appetite for spending more than the country makes means that a chunk of the spending is used for imports. If the United States boosted its saving \u2014 for example, by reducing its budget deficits \u2014 then that would reduce its trade deficit as well, economists say.",
      "\u201cIt's not like the rest of the world has been ripping us off for decades,\u201d said Jay Bryson, chief economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cIt's because we don't save enough.\u201d",
      "The flip side of America\u2019s low savings and big trade deficits is a steady inflow of foreign investment as other countries sink their export earnings into the United States. Direct foreign investment into the U.S. came to $349 billion in 2023, the World Bank reported, nearly double No. 2 Singapore\u2019s inflows.",
      "The only scenario in which tariffs reduce the U.S. deficit is if they cause investment in the U.S. to crash, said Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. That \"would be a disaster.\u2019\u2019",
      "Harvard University economist Dani Rodrik said a \u201cwell-designed industrial policy\u201d supported by select tariffs \"might have fostered increased investment and capacity in manufacturing.\"",
      "Instead, Rodrik said, Trump\u2019s actions just \u201cthrow up a lot of uncertainty\u201d and alienate America\u2019s best allies, making for \"a terrible policy all in all.\u2019\u2019",

      "Uncertainty is running high about what Trump will do next in his trade war. In a speech Tuesday night he said plans tariffs on pharmaceuticals so that more medications would be made in the U.S.",
      "Trump's latest tariffs include a massive 104% levy on U.S. imports of Chinese products. However, Chinese markets reversed early losses and gained ground on Wednesday.",
      "Driving the gains were massive share buybacks by big state-run investment funds and other state companies that often are instructed to support the market in times of crisis. Investors also are expecting the government to step up spending and other measures to help counter the impact of the tariffs, which will hit small manufacturers and traders that create the most jobs the hardest.",
      "Beijing issued a policy paper reiterating China's right to protect its businesses with unspecified countermeasures, while it emphasized it preferred to resolve trade issues through dialogue.",
      "The paper also argued that taking into account trade in services and U.S. companies\u2019 operations in China, economic exchange between the two countries is \u201croughly in balance.\u201d",
      "Hong Kong's Hang Seng rose 0.7%, while the Shanghai Composite index closed 1.3% higher.",
      "Thailand's benchmark also rose, apparently due to speculation that Beijing might be preparing to hold talks with the Trump administration. The unconfirmed rumors helped push the future for the S&P 500 up 0.3%, while that for the Dow was unchanged.",
      "Elsewhere, markets remained gloomy. Japan's Nikkei 225 closed 3.9% lower, at 31,714.03 and Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba convened a meeting of top financial ministers to reiterate his call for them to do what they can to mitigate the damage from tariffs to Japanese automakers and other manufacturers.",
      "Taiwan led the losses in Asia, as its Taiex plunged 5.8%. Big tech industries were among the biggest decliners. Computer chip giant TSMC Corp. dropped 3.8% while iPhone maker Hon Hai Precision Industry plunged 10%.",
      "In India, the Sensex declined 0.5% as the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate, while Bangkok\u2019s SET shed 0.8%.",
      "South Korea\u2019s Kospi lost 1.7% to 2,293.70, and the government said it would provide help for its beleaguered automakers. The S&P/ASX 200 in Australia declined 1.8% to 7,375.00. Shares in New Zealand also fell.",
      "In early European trading, Germany's DAX lost 2.4% to 19,796.83. In Paris, the CAC 40 declined 2.4% to 6,930.62. Britain's FTSE 100 gave up 2.2% to 7,735.72.",
      "On Tuesday, the S&P 500 dropped 1.6% after wiping out an early gain of 4.1%. That took it nearly 19% below its record set in February. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 0.8%, while the Nasdaq composite lost 2.1%.",
      "Stocks had rallied globally on Tuesday, with indexes up 6% in Tokyo, 2.5% in Paris and 1.6% in Shanghai. Any optimism or buying enthusiasm appeared to have dissipated by the time the sharply higher tariffs became reality.",
      "Analysts say the markets will have more swings up and down given uncertainty over how long Trump will keep the stiff tariffs on imports, which will raise prices for U.S. shoppers and slow the economy. If they persist, economists and investors expect them to cause a recession. If Trump lowers them through negotiations relatively quickly, the worst-case scenario might be avoided.",
      "Hope still remains on Wall Street that negotiations may be possible, which helped drive the morning\u2019s rally. Trump said Tuesday that a conversation with South Korea\u2019s acting president helped them reach the \u201cconfines and probability of a great DEAL for both countries.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war is an attack on the globalization that\u2019s shaped the world\u2019s economy and helped bring down prices for products on store shelves but also caused manufacturing jobs to leave for other countries. Trump has said he wants to narrow trade deficits, which measure how much more the United States imports from other countries than it sends to them as exports.",
      "In other dealings early Wednesday, U.S. benchmark crude oil fell $1.95 to $57.63 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, shed $2.02 to $60.80 per barrel.",
      "The U.S. dollar fell to 145.30 Japanese yen from 146.29 yen. The euro rose to $1.1035 from $1.0995.",
      "The price of gold rose $74 to $3,063 an ounce.",

      "The International Monetary Fund has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout package, providing a reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country\u2019s old economic order",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country's old economic order.",
      "As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF\u2019s executive board. The board will convene in the coming days, the IMF statement said.",
      "The fund's long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina's troubled economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts. The country has received more IMF bailouts than any other.",
      "It came at a critical moment for South America's second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina\u2019s rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and burned through its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.",
      "Fears grew that if the government failed to secure an IMF loan, hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.",
      "The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina's strict foreign exchange controls, which could help convince markets of his program's sustainability. For the past six years, the capital restrictions have dissuaded investment, preventing companies from sending profits abroad and ensuring the central bank's careful management the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.",
      "Racking up 22 IMF loans since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds have been used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a fraught reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country's historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.",
      "The IMF was wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor. But over the past 16 months, fund officials have praised Milei's austerity \u2014 a diet harsher than even the fund's typical prescription.",
      "A former TV personality and self-proclaimed \u201c anarcho-capitalist,\u201d Milei came to power on a vow to shrink Argentina's bloated bureaucracy, kill spiraling inflation, open the economy to international markets and woo foreign investors after years of isolation.",
      "Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has taken his chainsaw to the state, firing tens of thousands of state employees, dissolving or downgrading a dozen ministries, gutting the education sector, cutting inflation adjustments for pensions, freezing public works projects, lifting price controls and slashing subsidies.",
      "Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina's rosy macroeconomic indicators. Retirees have been protesting weekly against low pensions, with the decrease in payments accounting for the largest share of Milei\u2019s budget cuts. Major labor unions announced a 36-hour general strike starting Wednesday in solidarity.",
      "Still, Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, a surprise that analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation, which dropped to 118% from 211% annually during his first year in office. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent the local stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.",
      "\u201cThe agreement builds on the authorities\u2019 impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation,\u201d the IMF said in announcing the agreement under a 48-month arrangement. \u201cThe program supports the next phase of Argentina\u2019s homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.\"",
      "It remained unclear how much money Argentina would receive up-front \u2014 a key sticking point in the most recent negotiations over the deal's details. Argentina is seeking a hefty payment upfront to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.",
      "Milei shared the IMF statement on social media platform X, attaching a photo that showed him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. \u201cVavos!\u201d he wrote \u2014 apparently misspelling \u201cVamos!\u201d or \u201cLet's go!\u201d in his excitement.",

      "The latest leak in the Keystone oil pipeline in North Dakota on Tuesday continues the troubled history of the 15-year-old pipeline.",
      "The 2,700-mile-long (4,350-kilometer-long) pipeline originates in Alberta, Canada, and carries heavy tar sands crude oil south across the Dakotas and Nebraska before splitting to carry oil both to refineries in Illinois and south to Oklahoma and Texas.",
      "The Keystone Pipeline was constructed in 2010 at a cost of $5.2 billion. It was built by TC Energy, but it is now operated by South Bow as of 2024.",
      "There have been 23 spills along the Keystone oil pipeline, including four in North Dakota.",
      "One leak in 2022 in Kansas was the largest onshore oil spill in nine years. That rupture in the pipeline dumped about 14,000 barrels of crude oil into a creek running through rural pastureland in Washington County, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.",
      "The leaks have varied in size, but in total the Keystone pipeline has spilled more than 1 million gallons of crude oil over the years.",
      "South Bow estimated that 3,500 barrels spilled in this latest leak in North Dakota.",
      "The Pipeline Safety Trust advocacy group said that a 2021 report by the Government Accountability Office concluded that preventable construction issues contributed to more spills on the Keystone pipeline than on similar pipelines. The report also said that the pipeline's largest spills were \u201ccaused by issues related to the original design, manufacturing of the pipe, or construction of the pipeline.\u201d",
      "One example of that is the Kansas leak. The Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration determined that leak was caused due to the rupture of a weld that came from a fabrication facility.",
      "\u201cKeystone\u2019s incident history illustrates the problematic pipeline\u2019s systemic issues,\u201d Pipeline Safety Trust Executive Director Bill Caram said.",
      "When the original Keystone pipeline was proposed and built there was little controversy about the project, but it was a different story a few years later when TC Energy proposed building a second pipeline called the Keystone XL pipeline.",
      "That pipeline drew years of protests from environmental activists and landowners who worried that a spill could foul their land and water. Keystone XL was ultimately abandoned by the company in 2021 after President Joe Biden refused to approve a permit for it. President Donald Trump had tried to revive it during his first term, but Biden's decision ultimately killed the project.",
      "Climate change activists viewed the expansion of oil sands development as an environmental disaster that could speed up global warming as the fuel is burned. That turned Keystone into a flashpoint in the climate debate, and it became the focus of rallies and protests in Washington, D.C., and other cities.",

      "Congo says three Americans convicted of participating in a botched coup attempt last year have been repatriated to the United States",
      "LAGOS, Nigeria -- The three Americans convicted of participating in a botched coup attempt in Congo last year have been repatriated to the United States, days after their death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment, Congo's presidency said Tuesday.",
      "The three will serve out their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama said. The presidency said the Americans left Congo Tuesday morning.",
      "The State Department said it was aware of their transfer into U.S. custody and referred questions to the Department of Justice. A DOJ spokesperson said they did not immediately have information to share.",
      "The conditions of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear. But international law experts said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will shorten their sentences.",
      "Among the three Americans was 21-year-old Marcel Malanga, son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the foiled coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who live-streamed from the palace during the attempt, was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Marcel Malanga has said his father forced him to take part.",
      "Also repatriated were Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, a friend of the younger Malanga who flew to Africa from Utah for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company.",
      "The repatriation came amid efforts by Congolese authorities to sign a minerals deal with the U.S. in exchange for security support that will help the capital city of Kinshasa fight rebels in the country\u2019s conflict-hit east.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s senior adviser for Africa last week confirmed the countries were in talks on the issue and said it could involve \u201cmultibillion-dollar investments.\u201d The U.S. has estimated Congo has trillions of dollars in mineral wealth, much of it untapped.",
      "\u201cThis decision is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights between the two countries,\u201d Congo\u2019s presidency said Tuesday of the repatriation.",

Thompson\u2019s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told the AP that they didn\u2019t have all the details \u201cbut we\u2019re so excited to have him on American soil again.\u201d The Thompsons said they were grateful for all the support they received from the U.S. government, family and friends.",
      "Thompson\u2019s lawyer Skye Lazaro said Tuesday that she had limited information on what his status will be once he lands stateside. She said she plans to pursue all available legal avenues relating to his detention in the U.S.",
      "When the U.S. assumes custody of prisoners convicted abroad, it typically agrees to carry out a sentence of imprisonment designated by that country.",
      "Lawyers for the repatriated Americans could try to get their sentences reduced by arguing they signed their consents to the prisoner transfer treaty under duress, said Jared Genser, a U.S.-based international human rights attorney.",
      "\u201cBut it would be very hard to prevail in such a case as there would be enormous implications for other potential transfers in the future if the U.S. failed to abide by such agreements,\u201d Genser said.",
      "Dozens of others were convicted after the coup attempt, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian. Charges included terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons.",
      "The fate of the others was not immediately clear.",
      "Congo had reinstated the death penalty last year, lifting a more than 2-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks.",

I don\u2019t know what will happen in the future, but for the moment we are still shocked, and it doesn\u2019t look like this is going to be resolved.\u201d",
      "According to the government data released Tuesday, international arrivals from China were down nearly 1%. Leisure trips by Chinese citizens to places like Disneyland, Hawaii and New York are decreasing dramatically and likely won\u2019t pick up again until Trump has left office, said Wolfgang Georg Arlt, the CEO of the China Outbound Tourism Research Institute. He dubs it the \u201cTrump Slump.\u201d",
      "That slump has financial consequences. Tourism Economics expects U.S. spending by international visitors to drop by $9 billion this year.",
      "Marco Jahn is the president and CEO of New World Travel, a California company that works with overseas tour operators on vacation packages and activity planning. It arranges the hotels and rental cars for a family that wants to take a driving tour of U.S. national parks, for example.",
      "Jahn said bookings have dropped between 20% and 50%, depending on the source market, over the last eight to 10 weeks. He notes particular declines from Scandinavia, where Trump\u2019s repeated threat to take control of Greenland, a self-governing territory of NATO ally Denmark, has antagonized citizens.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is not perceived as a welcoming destination,\u201d Jahn said.",
      "Beyond, a revenue management platform for vacation rental owners, said Canadian searches for short-term rentals in the U.S. plunged 44% after Feb. 1, when Trump first announced a since-paused 25% tariff on goods from Canada and Mexico. Florida, Texas and New York were among the hardest-hit markets, Beyond said.",
      "American Ring Travel, a tour operator based in California, offers carbon-neutral bus tours of the U.S. that often attract eco-conscious travelers from Europe, said Richard Groesz, the company\u2019s director of contracting. But bookings from Germany flattened starting in January after Elon Musk threw his support behind a far-right political party in that country\u2019s federal election, Groesz said.",
      "There are other issues impacting foreign visits. The U.S. has been the top destination by country for Japanese tourists for years, but data compiled by JTB Tourism Research & Consulting showed South Korea topped the U.S. in January.",
      "The weak yen \u2013 not Trump \u2013 is likely the biggest factor dampening the attraction of the U.S., said Takaaki Mitamura, a spokesperson for Tokyo-based travel agent Veltra Corp. Travelers are picking destinations where the currency effect isn\u2019t as big, like South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Australia, he said.",
      "Haruka Atomiya, a Tokyo resident, visits Los Angeles at least once a year. Last year, she brought her young children for the first time and did a lot of research to find affordable places to stay. The exchange rate made some hotels double or triple the price she paid in the past.",
      "Atomiya, who went to college in Vermont, has always loved the diversity and the freedom in the U.S. She said she doesn\u2019t understand why Americans elected Trump, but doesn\u2019t plan to stop visiting unless she senses any physical danger.",
      "\u201cIf America changes in a way that\u2019s clearly visible, that\u2019s a reality, too, and I will likely keep visiting,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat will happen to America after Trump intrigues me.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- U.S. President Donald Trump and China sparred over tariff hikes and other retaliatory moves on Tuesday, as governments elsewhere were brainstorming strategies to cope with the trade war between the global economic giants.",
      "China said it will \u201cfight to the end\u201d and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Donald Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports in retaliation for Beijing's backlash against the 34% tariffs he ordered on his April 2 \u201cLiberation Day.\u201d",

      "India, which faces a 26% tariff on its exports to the U.S., is hoping for concessions as part of the trade deal. A first tranche of the agreement is expected by this fall. Washington wants India to allow more open market access for U.S. dairy and other farm products, but New Delhi has balked at that since farming employs the bulk of India's workforce.",

      "Still, he chided the U.S., saying Malaysia\u2019s trade with the U.S. had long been a model of mutual gain, with its exports supporting Malaysia\u2019s growth as well as high-quality jobs for Americans. The 24% tariff recently imposed on Malaysian imports was \u201charming all\u201d and might have negative impact on both economies, he said.",

      "Jordan Spieth's 3-year-old son, Sammy, was among the kids who stole the show at the Masters Par 3 Contest on Wednesday",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Sammy Spieth, age 3, hit a better tee shot by his standards than playing partners Justin Thomas and Max Homa did by theirs on the second hole of the Par 3 Contest at the Masters. He teed up a driver, gripped it cross-handed and sent his ball about 30 yards down the middle, while Thomas and Homa hit their wedges short and right into a bunker.",
      "Sammy's dad, 2015 Masters champion Jordan Spieth, didn't bother to tee off. He had enough to manage with a team of caddies \u2014 all wearing white Augusta National coveralls \u2014 that included Sammy, 1-year-old daughter Sophie and wife Annie, who is expecting a third child in July.",
      "The record book will show that Masters rookie Nico Echavarria won the Par 3 on Wednesday, beating J.J. Spaun with a birdie on the second playoff hole after each shot 5-under 22. While the Masters is arguably the easiest major to win because of its small field that includes aging past champions, the Par 3 is much easier, because most players don't even try.",
      "Gary Player certainly does. The oldest living Masters champion at age 89, he made three straight birdies \u2014 flirting with aces on Nos. 6 and 7 \u2014 to get his name onto the leaderboard, although he ultimately didn't post an official score.",
      "The same was true of 70 players in the field of 90. That trend likely will continue as long as the winner on Augusta National's tranquil, 1,090-yard par-3 course fails to win the green jacket. The contest began in 1960 and no one has won it and the Masters in the same year.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never really been, like, buy into the jinx too much, but I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever turned in a card,\u201d Thomas said.",
      "Rory McIlroy was joined by wife Erica and 4-year-old daughter Poppy, who holed a birdie putt on the ninth hole when she nudged the ball with her dad's putter and it nearly stopped before it caught a slope and ran into the hole.",
      "McIlroy, who would complete the career Grand Slam with a victory on Sunday, appreciated the chance to focus on his daughter, who interrupted his on-course interview with ESPN.",
      "\u201cThe buildup to this event is a lot, and the sort of anticipation and we\u2019re waiting eight or nine months for the next major to roll around from the Open Championship,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cTo end your preparation with an afternoon like this ... it's such a fun afternoon.\u201d",
      "Keegan Bradley made the first ace of the day when his approach on the 140-yard sixth hole caught a ridge and trickled into the cup. He hoisted each of his sons in the air, and when the family got to the green, Bradley's younger boy, 4-year-old Cooper, ran to the hole, looked down and clapped his hands together at the sight of the ball. He lifted it out and raised his arm in triumph.",
      "Earlier, when the Bradley family made its way down the first hole, 7-year-old Logan showed an impressive grasp of Masters patron etiquette when he yelled at his younger brother, \u201cYou can't run!\u201d",
      "Byeong Hun An's 5-year-old son, Sun-woo, got a cheer worthy of an ace when he bombed a drive about halfway to the green on the 130-yard first hole. Sun-woo then took out an iron and after a couple of whiffs \u2014 er, practice swings \u2014 he hit a worm-burner that scooted into a greenside bunker.",
      "Scottie Scheffler holed a 3-footer for birdie on the first hole, a feat more impressive because he did it one-handed while holding his 11-month-old son, Bennett.",
      "Tom Hoge gave been-there, done-that high-fives to the players and caddies in his group when he aced the 90-yard fourth with a shot that spun back and slammed into the flagstick. Brooks Koepka used the slope behind the hole on the sixth for the last hole-in-one of the day and 115th in the contest's history.",
      "Participation in the Par 3 is optional, and a handful of players \u2014 including Xander Schauffele, Patrick Cantlay and Phil Mickelson \u2014 opted out, choosing to grind on the range or play practice rounds well into the afternoon ahead of Thursday's opening round.",

This week takes a lot of energy,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough walk, it\u2019s hilly, and the mental energy you\u2019re expending as well. Get this done, and then just go home, have dinner, relax and get ready for tomorrow.\u201d",

Gujarat has a two-point lead over second-placed Delhi Capitals, which has played two fewer games. Delhi has won all three of its games and is the only unbeaten team in the tournament.",
      "Rajasthan, which came into the game on the back of successive wins against Chennai Super Kings and Punjab, is seventh after five matches.",
      "Arshad Khan and Mohammed Siraj took the sting out of Rajasthan\u2019s run-chase inside the first three overs when they dismissed Yashasvi Jaiswal and Nitish Rana cheaply.",
      "Jaiswal timed the ball confidently, only to see Rashid not moving an inch at third man for the catch, and Rana\u2019s ramp shot flew to Kulwant Khejroliya, also at third man, as Rajasthan slipped to 12-2.",
      "Samson and Riyan Parag (26) revived the chase briefly with Parag smashing three sixes. Parag was convinced he didn\u2019t edge impact player, left-arm fast bowler Khejroliya, after Gujarat went for a successful television review.",
      "Rashid, who picked up just one wicket in the last four matches, struck when Dhruv Jorel misread the googly and Sudharsan gobbled a low catch at deep mid-wicket.",
      "Samson was undone by Krishna\u2019s extra pace and got caught at short third man before Hetmyer made a brisk half century. He was eventually caught at deep backward square in the 16th over off another Krishna short ball to end Rajasthan\u2019s slim hopes.",
      "Sudharsan continued his sublime form. He and Jos Buttler laid the foundation for a big Gujarat score with an 80-run, second-wicket stand.",
      "That came after captain Shubman Gill (2) had his off stump clattered by Jofra Archer\u2019s 147 kph (91 mph) delivery before Sudharsan and Buttler took the total to 94.",
      "Buttler, who moved to Gujarat after playing seven IPL seasons for Rajasthan, made 36 off 25 balls against his long-time franchise before falling lbw to Maheesh Theekshana (2-54) off a delivery that spun back sharply.",
      "Shahrukh Khan hit a quick-fire 36 off 20 before Theekshana had him stumped off a full delivery.",
      "Sudharsan kept Gujarat going at more than 10 an over by smashing three sixes and eight fours but missed out on a century. He was caught behind off a thin inside edge against Tushar Deshpande (2-53) in the penultimate over as Rahul Tewatia (24 not out in 12 balls) carried Gujarat over the 200-run mark.",

    "story": [
      "Paige Bueckers is clearly the best-known player in Monday\u2019s WNBA draft, but Dominique Malonga of France is among the most interesting",
      "NEW YORK -- Paige Bueckers is clearly the best-known player in Monday's WNBA draft, but Dominique Malonga of France is among the most interesting.",
      "Curiosity around the 6-foot-6 forward seems to be growing.",
      "\u201cShe is a unbelievably intriguing player because she has size, athleticism and range,\u201d former Washington Mystics general manager Mike Thibault said. \u201cShe\u2019s got a wide range of skills, which makes her pretty intriguing.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s not much doubt Bueckers is going to have an immediate impact in Dallas on and off the court as the team's first pick, giving the Wings one of the most efficient players coming out of college in quite some time.",
      "Whether other players in the draft can offer quick help to teams will be seen over the next few months. A lot of that depends on which teams draft which players and how that fit evolves.",
      "It certainly applies to Malonga, who played for France's national team at last year's Paris Olympics.",
      "Still only 19, she averaged 15.0 points and 10.3 rebounds this season while playing professional basketball for Lyon.",
      "\u201cIf she were in the U.S.,\u201d Thibault said, \u201cshe would be a college sophomore basically with all that potential in front of her.\u201d",
      "ESPN analyst Debbie Antonelli believes players in this draft have a chance to be successful, though they don't bring the name recognition or resumes the players in last year's draft had.",
      "\u201cI think the timing for this class with expansion and the increased value in franchises and in the growth of the game will bring another level of incredible play from these players that have already been on a stage similar,\u201d Antonelli said.",
      "Five teams in the league don't even have first round picks: New York, Indiana, Phoenix and Atlanta all traded away their picks. Las Vegas forfeited its pick following an investigation by the league in 2023 that found the franchise violated league rules regarding impermissible player benefits and workplace policies.",
      "Washington has three picks in the first round and Connecticut has two. Both teams are rebuilding and players could find a lot of available minutes there. There's also the expansion Golden State franchise that should have a lot of open spots, too.",
      "Here are some players to keep an eye on that could dictate how the draft unfolds once Dallas makes Bueckers the expected No. 1 player selected:",
      "Malonga isn't the only player in the draft who has honed her skills in France. Juste Jocyte, Malonga's Lyon teammate in the French basketball league, is also expected to be taken in the first round.",
      "If Seattle takes her second, she'll be paired with an already strong frontcourt alongside Ezi Magbegor and Nneka Ogwumike, which could give the Storm a formidable front line.",
      "Jocyte is a versatile player who can play any of the guard positions and is really effective in the pick and roll. The Lithuanian, who is also 19 years old, scored 22 points against Belgium in EuroBasket qualifying a few months ago. She has a toughness about her and is fundamentally sound.",
      "\u201cShe's left-handed and knows how to play with or without the ball in her hands,\u201d Thibault said. \u201cNot a true point guard, but can handle the ball. She's a smart player who knows how to use screens.\u201d",
      "Aneesah Morrow has a nose for the ball with a desire to go get it.",
      "She is just 6-1, but led the nation in double-doubles, averaging 18.7 points and 13.5 rebounds a game with LSU to finish second all-time behind Courtney Paris in that category. She is able to grab boards over much taller opponents and just has a knack for rebounding. She shot 49% from the field, but most of her shots came from close to the basket. She'll need to increase her range.",
      "Georgia Amoore and Hailey Van Lith are combo guards who can score and also distribute to teammates.",
      "Amoore averaged 19.6 points and 6.9 assists at Kentucky this season after transferring from Virginia Tech. At 5-6, she might have a more difficult time getting her shot off then she did in college.",
      "Van Lith benefitted from playing in the Olympics and winning a bronze medal with the USA Basketball 3-on-3 team last year. She averaged 17.7 points and 5.4 assists this past season to help TCU reach the Elite Eight for the first time in school history.",

      "Min Woo Lee had won just about everywhere but the PGA Tour before he triumphed at the Texas Open",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Min Woo Lee broke into the top 25 in the world following his victory a couple weeks ago at the Houston Open, the long-awaited first on the PGA Tour for the big-hitting Australian who had won just about everywhere else around the world.",
      "Jason Day thinks his fellow Aussie can climb even higher.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all up to him if he wants to get to No. 1,\u201d said Day, who spent 51 weeks there starting in September 2015. \"It\u2019s a lifestyle change he has to understand. I know that he has the tools and the mental side to do it because he loves the moment, and that\u2019s something you cannot teach golfers in general, to love being in that moment and under the most stress.",
      "\u201cIf he can really enjoy that and just improve over time, he\u2019ll be probably be our next No. 1,\u201d Day added. \"I\u2019m going to take myself out of the conversation because that\u2019s my goal as well. But he\u2019s got the best chance to become No. 1 from Australia.\"",
      "Greg Norman spent 331 weeks at No. 1 in the 1980s and '90s. Adam Scott spent 11 weeks there in 2014.",
      "\u201cI always felt like I had the assets to win, it was just can you do it mentally?\u201d said Lee, who acknowledged that Day had helped in that regard \u2014 credit that Day in turn passed along to Karrie Webb, one of Australia's greatest players.",
      "She had also passed along some advice to the 26-year-old Lee, who heads into this week's Masters having made the cut in two of his previous three appearances at Augusta National, including a tie for 22nd last year.",
      "\u201cI wanted him to hear, \u2018Hey, this is what she did. This is what I did. A lot of these other guys did,\u2019\u201d Day explained. \u201cWhen you want to be No. 1, everything has to be in order. Certain sacrifices need to happen. ... There is only a certain amount of people that can sit on that perch. It\u2019s nice to look back and say, 'I accomplished that.'\u201d",
      "Viktor Hovland is a naturally inquisitive fella, which comes in handy when it comes to golf. The 27-year-old from Norway likes to tinker with things, which is how he came to have a new driver in the bag for the Masters this week.",
      "It's also how he wound up last week on the \u201cUAP Files Podcast\u201d \u2014 as in, unidentified anomalous phenomena.",
      "UFOs, in common parlance. Extraterrestrials. Space aliens.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s just interesting when you have an open mind,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cEven in the golf swing, you can get very dogmatic and you look at things as, \u2018Oh, this has to be a truth. This has to be correct.\u2019 And sometimes the beliefs that you hold the most deeply can obfuscate yourself. When you question things and look at things from different angles, you might get to a deeper truth.\"",
      "Sure, Hovland says, there are moments when he thinks, \"OK, I know this is getting into territory that's very speculative.\"",
      "\u201cBut I think as long as you have an objective kind of mindset while looking into this information, I think it\u2019s just fun,\u201d Hovland said. \u201cYou don't have to live and die by every word you read or thing you hear.\u201d",
      "Augusta National doesn't see a need to update its criteria to create a special category for LIV Golf players. Chairman Fred Ridley said that can be handled through special invitations, which is what Joaquin Niemann received each of the last two years.",
      "U.S. Open and British Open organizers this year are exempting the leading player from the LIV Golf League points list.",
      "\u201cWe feel we can deal with that issue \u2014 whether it\u2019s a LIV player or a player on some other tour that might not otherwise be eligible for an invitation \u2014 that we can handle that with a special invitation,\" Ridley said.",
      "PGA Tour winners (that offer full FedEx Cup points) get automatic invitations. The LIV Golf players who won 54-hole tournaments since last year's Masters who are not at Augusta National this week are Brendan Steele, Carlos Ortiz, Adrian Meronk and Marc Leishman, who won last week at Doral.",
      "All eight of the PGA Tour winners in the fall, where most fields were weak because they were primarily players trying to keep their tour cards, received invitations. That list includes Kevin Yu, Rafael Campos and Matt McCarty.",
      "Key to the Masters is keeping the field under 100 players. The field is at 95 this year.",
      "\u201cWe will have a thorough examination of our qualifications after the tournament this year, and we may make some changes,\u201d Ridley said. \u201cNot necessarily that, but some years we do make changes, some years we don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He also said the Masters would study whether winners of strong European tour events, such as the BMW PGA Championship and Hero Dubai Desert Classic, should get an exemption.",
      "Justin Thomas will have Joe Greiner on his bag this week, making the change Tuesday night after his usual caddie, Matt \u201cRev\u201d Minister, hurt his back. Greiner had recently split with Max Homa, his longtime partner.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very lucky Joe Greiner is a great friend and able to help me out last minute,\u201d Thomas said on social media.",
      "Greiner helped Homa tie for third at Augusta National last year. But the six-time PGA Tour winner has slumped badly since, and Greiner decided it would be best to split with his childhood friend ahead of last week\u2019s Texas Open.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard. I\u2019m just so used to him caddying,\u201d said Homa, who now has Bill Harke on his bag. \u201cIt\u2019s been hard to process, but also good in a way, because friendship does matter more than any of this stuff.\u201d",

      "DETROIT -- The Detroit Tigers are wrapping up their first homestand with a subtle change on the field at Comerica Park, putting grass over a strip of dirt that used to be between the pitcher's mound and batter's box.",
      "AL Cy Young and Triple Crown winner Tarik Skubal said he\u2019s glad the team got rid of the keyhole, making the lefty\u2019s sightline the same as it is in every other ballpark in Major League Baseball.",
      "\u201cI might get some heat for this, but they asked what we thought of it, and I said I didn\u2019t really like it,\u201d Skubal said Wednesday morning before a series-ending game against the New York Yankees. \"I wasn\u2019t a fan of it.",
      "\u201cObviously, I understand from a fan perspective. It\u2019s unique and stuff, but just from a visual perspective, it\u2019s so much different.\u201d",
      "Detroit was the last team in the majors to have the throwback feature \u2014 which was common in the 1800s and early 1900s \u2014 in their ballpark that opened in 2000 after leaving Tiger Stadium. The Arizona Diamondbacks also had a keyhole at Chase Field before removing it in 2019 when they changed their playing surface from grass to synthetic turf.",
      "The Tigers also made major renovations in the seating area behind home plate, removing a tunnel that was mostly used by umpires and installing state-of-the-art chairs that allow fans to heat or cool their seats.",
      "\u201cI'm a fan of having no tunnel,\u201d Skubal said. \u201cI'm glad it's gone. It makes it feel pretty clean back there.\u201d",
      "While Skubal said the front office asked for his input following the 2024 season and he gave his strong opinion, two other pitchers on the staff simply shrugged their shoulders when asked about the new-look view and an All-Star outfielder insisted he didn't even realize the keyhole was gone.",
      "\u201cThey asked a couple guys, but it didn't bother me,\u201d right-handed reliever Will Vest said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t really move the needle too much for me.\u201d",
      "When lefty Tyler Holton is on the mound, he said he's locked in on the catcher's target with or without a path of dirt in front of him.",
      "\u201cI think if you\u2019re noticing things like that, you\u2019re probably not focused on what you need to be focused on,\u201d Holton said.",
      "Riley Greene, meanwhile, insisted he didn't know the keyhole was gone until a reporter asked him about it on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cI'm going to be honest, I didn't even notice it,\u201d Greene said. \u201cSomebody told me that it was being taken out and I was like, `Oh, cool. I\u2019m probably not even going to notice it.' And, I haven\u2019t even noticed it.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe would tell each other \u2018this is the putt to win the Masters,\u2019\u201d Rasmus said, \u201cand then try to compete with each other.\u201d",
      "This week they\u2019ll both have a chance to fulfill that childhood dream \u2014 all while making Masters history.",
      "The Danish duo will become the first set of twins ever to play in the Masters together. There have been 18 sets of brothers who\u2019ve played here together, most recently Italy\u2019s Eduardo and Francesco Molinari from 2010-2012, but none have been twins.",
      "\u201cI think we really started watching the Masters when we were about 10, 11 years old,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cSo 2012 when Bubba (Watson) won was probably the first real memory we have of the place. Yeah, it\u2019s nice to be here now.\u201d",
      "This is Nicolai's second Masters.",
      "He actually led last year's tournament for 10 holes in the third round, only to fall out of contention after shooting 74 and 76 on the weekend. He finished tied for 16th. It was Nicolai's best finish in nine majors, but not enough to earn an automatic bid to this year's tournament since only the top 12 are guaranteed a spot. He received a special invitation to play the Masters this year.",
      "Rasmus is making his first Masters appearance, earning his way in after finishing in the top 50 in the world rankings last year. This will be his seventh major.",
      "On Sunday, the 24-year-old twins toured the historic course together and Nicolai pointed out some tips to his slightly younger brother on how to navigate one of golf's toughest challenges this week since Rasmus has never played here. That preceded a joint news conference on Tuesday, where they inadvertently wound up \u201ctwinning\u201d after showing up in similar outfits.",
      "\u201cCompletely random,\u201d Nicolai joked.",
      "The twins would be nearly indecipherable if not for Rasmus' slightly longer hair.",
      "There have been other twins in golf, but none quite as accomplished as the Hojgaards. Rasmus ranks 55th in the world and has won five times on the European Tour, two more than his brother. Nicolai ranks 82nd and was a member of the winning European Ryder Cup team in 2023.",
      "They won\u2019t be playing in the same group at the Masters on Thursday, however.",
      "Nicolai will be in the second threesome on the course, while Rasmus tees off in the afternoon.",
      "There was a time that might have been a good thing. Growing up, the twins were extremely competitive on the course and didn't always get along. When one brother beat the other they would often go days without speaking to one another.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think we supported each other very much back then,\u201d Rasmus said. \u201cWe would fight a lot more than saying congratulations.\u201d",
      "There are no regrets, though.",
      "Nicolai said that fierce sibling rivalry helped shape and drive them to get to where they are today.",
      "\"That helped a certain amount, really wanting to beat each other and that competitive edge we both have,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "Times have since changed somewhat, though.",
      "The twins have matured and are now big supporters of each other's game and the successes that have come along with it. They can often be seen practicing together and helping each other as much as possible when their games veer off course.",
      "\u201cWe got older and we can shake each other\u2019s hand now and say congrats when someone is playing well \u2014 and be brothers as well and friends at the same time,\u201d Nicolai said.",
      "But the competitiveness will always be there.",
      "So what happens if the other brother knocks off defending champion Scottie Scheffler and gets to wear the green jacket on Sunday?",
      "\u201cProbably be very frustrating,\u201d Rasmus said with a long laugh. \u201cNo, I think it would be very cool. It would be very cool. If something like that happens, I think we\u2019ll deal with it at the time, but I think it\u2019s hard to sit here and try and explain what that would feel like.\"",

      "Augusta National looks as pristine as ever on the eve of the Masters",
      "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- The patrons walking up the first fairway at Augusta National during a sun-splashed practice round for the Masters managed to find a nice viewpoint between a couple of pines, where they watched as Justin Rose hit an approach shot to the green.",
      "There are quite a few more places for them to perch after Hurricane Helen tore through Georgia last summer.",
      "By the time the deadly Category 4 storm churned north and finally dissipated, it left in its wake an estimated 1 million downed trees, thousands without power, and some 7 million cubic yards of debris to pick up. The city of Augusta was devastated, and the pristine property that annually hosts golf's most revered tournament was left with its own massive clean-up effort.",
      "Nearly six months later, it's hard to tell anything was ever amiss. The fairways and greens are perfectly manicured, the azaleas once again in bloom. All that are missing are the hundreds of trees that failed to survive the storm.",
      "\u201cIt almost felt like I was playing the back nine for the first time,\u201d two-time major winner Xander Schauffele said. \u201cThere's trees you aim at off the tee, and over the 11th green you can \u2014 when you're walking down 10, you can see half the course.\u201d",
      "That sweeping vista left Schauffele with mixed feelings. In some respects, it was neat to see what was happening elsewhere on the property, thanks to panoramic views that are probably a lot like what Alister MacKenzie and Bobby Jones would have had as they plotted the layout on a former nursery and antebellum plantation in the early 1930s.",
      "In other respects, Schauffele said, \u201cit's sad to see, too, how many trees have fallen.\u201d",
      "The missing trees should not demonstrably affect the way the course plays when the Masters begins Thursday. Some of those towering pines served as convenient aiming points \u2014 over the 11th green, for example \u2014 but markers that are just as helpful. And the most wayward shots will still be penalized by trunks and limbs among the pine straw.",
      "\u201cWhen you're hitting into the trees,\u201d Scottie Scheffler said, \u201cyou're still going to be in a good amount of trouble.\u201d",
      "The more interesting discussion seems to center on whether the loss of so many trees was an unintended positive.",
      "John Fought played in the Masters three times in the 1970s and \u201880s before his second career as a lauded golf course architect behind such well-known layouts as Pumpkin Ridge in Oregon. He's among many who have embraced the removal of unnecessary trees at such classic courses as Oakmont, and restoring them to the what their original designers intended.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion the course has undergone a lot of change. Not just in length \u2014 which is obvious \u2014 but also in its tree planting,\u201d Fought said, pointing specifically to trees down the right of No. 11 and behind Nos. 15 and 17. \u201cSome of this tree planting has been good, but overall it has changed the course markedly from the course Bobby Jones and Alister Mackenzie envisioned.\u201d",
      "Indeed, Jones and MacKenzie often said that St. Andrews served as an inspiration for Augusta National. It is evident in the large, undulating greens, the absence of penal rough, and the risk-reward opportunities that exist across the course.",
      "There are no towering pines on the windswept Scottish coast, though.",
      "\u201cSt. Andrews is wide open with many angles to play from. I would like to see more of that,\" Fought said. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I love the Masters and how it is run, but I have observed that trees have become a dominating force in the design.\u201d",
      "Much of that has been by necessity.",
      "One way to combat advancements in technology, and force players to hit similar shots to those of decades ago, has been to lengthen the course. But another has been to tighten it. When the club transplanted 36 pines in 2003, then-Masters chairman Hootie Johnson said the impetus was to continue \u201cour long-standing emphasis on accuracy off the tee.\u201d",
      "In the late 1990s, longtime New Yorker and Golf Digest writer David Owen was asked to write a history of the club, and granted unfettered access to its vast archives. His book, \u201cThe Making of the Masters,\u201d is considered its definitive account.",
      "Owen points out that Jones \u201cdescribed the course as \u2018of national design,\u2019\u201d and he embraced changes suggested by many people. And while Mackenzie did call St. Andrews the model, \u201cyou kind of have to suspend disbelief to see real similarities.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say the changes have been necessary,\u201d Owen concluded. \u201cPros today would annihilate the course as it was in 1934.\u201d",
      "How they will fare in 2025 remains to be seen.",
      "Thanks to Hurricane Helene, those walking the property this week at least will have different places to watch it.",
      "\u201cI just think it looks better. I don\u2019t know why I say that,\u201d admitted Fred Couples, the 1992 Masters champion. \"The other day we played No. 1 and we were standing on the green and you just look right down and you see a lot more room on the ninth tee. I think that\u2019s kind of cool. You can watch people hit. There\u2019s a few areas where it blew right through there, but for me personally, I know a lot of trees went down. I know this town was devastated. But the golf course is unbelievable.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of trees,\u201d Couples said. \u201cMy God.\u201d",

      "Kris Jenkins, who made the winning shot for Villanova in the 2016 college basketball championship game, is suing the NCAA and six conferences to recoup income he contends he would have earned if athletes at the time were not barred from making money from their name, image and likeness.",
      "Jenkins is among some 350 current and former athletes who have opted out of a $2.8 billion antitrust settlement with the NCAA that's on the cusp of final approval. Some of the opt-outs have filed lawsuits to pursue lost income on their own.",
      "NCAA athletes weren't allowed to make NIL money until July 2021. The so-called House settlement would provide back pay for athletes dating back to 2016, with the amount for each generally determined by sport and how much the athlete played. Jenkins played at Villanova from 2013-17 and in his last two seasons started 72 of 76 games and averaged 13 points per game.",

      "As a result of that shot, the lawsuit says, the NCAA reportedly paid the Big East $19.1 million to distribute among its member schools; the athletic department received a $22.6 million gift, largest in program history; and the athletic program generated $11.4 million in revenue and fully funded its non-revenue sports.",

      "Emanuel Sharp was unable to get off a 3-pointer with Walter Clayton Jr. running toward him and leaping with his left arm extended.

Riley Securities.",
      "The two companies announced on Jan. 21 that they were altering the agreement that had made Microsoft the exclusive provider of OpenAI's computing power, enabling the smaller company to build its own capacity, \u201cprimarily for research and training of models.\u201d It was the same day that newly inaugurated President Donald Trump touted OpenAI's partnership with Oracle and SoftBank to pledge $500 billion in new AI infrastructure in the U.S., starting with a data center in Texas.",
      "Microsoft has long built data centers around the world to run its cloud computing services. The generative AI boom accelerated the demand for such facilities, both to train new AI systems and to keep them running as millions of people start using chatbots and other AI tools at work and home.",
      "The computing it takes to run AI tools is expensive and requires a large amount of electricity \u2014 so much so that Trump this week cited AI needs as part of the justification for using his emergency authorities to boost the U.S. coal industry, a reliable but polluting energy source.

      "Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date",
      "WASHINGTON -- Thanks to a mouse watching clips from \u201cThe Matrix,\u201d scientists have created the largest functional map of a brain to date \u2013 a diagram of the wiring connecting 84,000 neurons as they fire off messages.",
      "Using a piece of that mouse\u2019s brain about the size of a poppy seed, the researchers identified those neurons and traced how they communicated via branch-like fibers through a surprising 500 million junctions called synapses.",
      "The massive dataset, published Wednesday by the journal Nature, marks a step toward unraveling the mystery of how our brains work. The data, assembled in a 3D reconstruction colored to delineate different brain circuitry, is open to scientists worldwide for additional research \u2013 and for the simply curious to take a peek.",
      "\u201cIt definitely inspires a sense of awe, just like looking at pictures of the galaxies,\u201d said Forrest Collman of the Allen Institute for Brain Science in Seattle, one of the project\u2019s leading researchers. \u201cYou get a sense of how complicated you are. We\u2019re looking at one tiny part ... of a mouse\u2019s brain and the beauty and complexity that you can see in these actual neurons and the hundreds of millions of connections between them.\u201d",
      "How we think, feel, see, talk and move are due to neurons, or nerve cells, in the brain \u2013 how they\u2019re activated and send messages to each other. Scientists have long known those signals move from one neuron along fibers called axons and dendrites, using synapses to jump to the next neuron. But there\u2019s less known about the networks of neurons that perform certain tasks and how disruptions of that wiring could play a role in Alzheimer's, autism or other disorders.",
      "\u201cYou can make a thousand hypotheses about how brain cells might do their job but you can\u2019t test those hypotheses unless you know perhaps the most fundamental thing \u2013 how are those cells wired together,\u201d said Allen Institute scientist Clay Reid, who helped pioneer electron microscopy to study neural connections.",
      "With the new project, a global team of more than 150 researchers mapped neural connections that Collman compares to tangled pieces of spaghetti winding through part of the mouse brain responsible for vision.",
      "The first step: Show a mouse video snippets of sci-fi movies, sports, animation and nature.",
      "A team at Baylor College of Medicine did just that, using a mouse engineered with a gene that makes its neurons glow when they\u2019re active. The researchers used a laser-powered microscope to record how individual cells in the animal\u2019s visual cortex lit up as they processed the images flashing by.",
      "Next, scientists at the Allen Institute analyzed that small piece of brain tissue, using a special tool to shave it into more than 25,000 layers, each far thinner than a human hair. With electron microscopes, they took nearly 100 million high-resolution images of those sections, illuminating those spaghetti-like fibers and painstakingly reassembling the data in 3D.",
      "Finally, Princeton University scientists used artificial intelligence to trace all that wiring and \u201cpaint each of the individual wires a different color so that we can identify them individually,\u201d Collman explained.",
      "They estimated that microscopic wiring, if laid out, would measure more than 3 miles (5 kilometers). Importantly, matching up all that anatomy with the activity in the mouse's brain as it watched movies allowed researchers to trace how the circuitry worked.",
      "The Princeton researchers also created digital 3D copies of the data that other scientists can use in developing new studies.",
      "Could this kind of mapping help scientists eventually find treatments for brain diseases? The researchers call it a foundational step, like how the Human Genome Project that provided the first gene mapping eventually led to gene-based treatments. Mapping a full mouse brain is one next goal.",
      "\u201cThe technologies developed by this project will give us our first chance to really identify some kind of abnormal pattern of connectivity that gives rise to a disorder,\u201d another of the project's leading researchers, Princeton neuroscientist and computer scientist Sebastian Seung, said in a statement.",
      "The work \u201cmarks a major leap forwards and offers an invaluable community resource for future discoveries,\u201d wrote Harvard neuroscientists Mariela Petkova and Gregor Schuhknecht, who weren\u2019t involved in the project.",
      "The huge and publicly shared data \u201cwill help to unravel the complex neural networks underlying cognition and behavior,\u201d they added.",

      "But they cautioned more samples are needed for a clearer picture.",
      "A better understanding of the abundance of water in the lunar mantle can help explain how the moon evolved, the researchers noted. But it could also be all the more reason for astronauts to stick close to the near side of the moon as currently planned.",
      "China became the first country to land on the moon\u2019s far side last year. The Chang\u2019e 6 spacecraft scooped up the volcanic rock and dirt from the ancient, sprawling South Pole-Aitken basin, one of the largest impact craters in the solar system.",
      "The Chinese Academy of Sciences\u2019 Sen Hu said he and his team received 5 grams of soil samples, then selected 578 particles for detailed analysis using electron microscopes.",
      "They estimated the water abundance at less than 1.5 micrograms per gram, on the dry end of what\u2019s been found in samples gathered over past decades from the moon\u2019s near side. Measurements on samples from the near side have ranged between 1 microgram and 200 micrograms per gram.",
      "Given the limited sampling, it\u2019s uncertain how widespread this dry condition might be, the scientists noted in their study published in the journal Nature.",
      "\u201cMore far side samples are required for testing and further unraveling\" how much water there is, Hu said in an email.",
      "It\u2019s possible the impact that created this basin may have blasted water elements to the near side, leaving the far side depleted. Another possibility is that the vertical distribution of water could be different between the two hemispheres.",
      "Even if confirmed, the findings shouldn\u2019t drastically alter NASA\u2019s plans to send astronauts to the moon\u2019s south polar region, where permanently shadowed craters are believed to hold massive amounts of ice. This frozen water could be used for drinking, cooking and making rocket fuel.",
      "NASA aims to send four astronauts around the moon next year under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo, which put 12 men on the moon from 1969 through 1972. That would be followed by a landing near the lunar south pole by astronauts no earlier than 2027. China is seeking its own astronaut moon landing by 2030.",

    "summary": "Economic experts warn that the president's worldwide tariffs would not disincentivize firms from opening up manufacturing in the U.S. because of the major instability.",
    "story": [
      "\"Trump has a fundamental misunderstanding of how trade works,\" one said.",
      "It's an argument President Donald Trump makes repeatedly as an end goal of his sweeping tariffs: America needs to bring companies and their manufacturing jobs -- back to the U.S.",
      "That's a key reason, he says, that he imposed his hefty tariffs across the globe, with the heaviest levied on China, Vietnam and the European Union (although on Wednesday he put higher tariffs on some countries on pause -- excepting China).",
      "\"Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country,\" Trump said last week in announcing his tariffs. \"And ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.\"",
      "Making steel, aluminum and other products in the U.S. is a matter of national security, he added.",
      "But on a practical level, experts say companies could take a long time to relocate, factories a long time to build and the cost of doing so -- plus higher American labor wages -- could make their products more expensive for American consumers.",
      "Trump has 'fundamental misunderstanding': Expert",
      "Some economists and international trade experts told ABC News that the president's controversial trade policy could actually discourage firms from setting up factories on American soil.",
      "\"Trump has a fundamental misunderstanding of how trade works. More domestic manufacturing does not mean a better economy,\" Justin Wolfers, a professor of economics and public policy at the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan, told ABC News. \"It's an example I see a lot in 18-year-olds who turn up on the first day of my economics class.\"",
      "Wolfers and others contend that the decades of a U.S. shift from a manufacturing-heavy economy to one more based in financial and intellectual capital, tech and other white-collar fields, has done more to help American consumers and workers.",
      "Wolfers said that Trump's tariffs are a \"solution looking for a rationale,\" given the disparity between manufacturing and other sectors, which have attracted a lot of talent domestically.",
      "\"One of the questions posed by the tariffs is should we undermine the competitiveness of the 140 million (non-manufacturing) jobs to satisfy the other 13 million (manufacturing)?\" he said.",
      "Layna Mosley, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, told ABC News that the \"romanticizing\" of America as a global manufacturing superpower ignores the fact that American companies have found ways to deliver top products in demand worldwide by spreading out the supply chain.",
      "\"There is an idea that the U.S. used to do a lot of things domestically and the reason we didn't do that is that our economy has evolved,\" she said.",
      "Mosley noted that the components such as microchips and textiles are deeply rooted in international manufacturing markets because they have greater access to those materials.",
      "\"Oftentimes, there is no substitute available,\" Mosley said.",
      "A long time frame amid uncertainty",
      "Even if companies do decide to abandon their international manufacturing sites and return to America, the economic experts said it will take an exceptionally long time for the American job market and consumers to benefit.",
      "Trump himself admitted as much to reporters on Friday.",
      "\"Now, the good news is a lot of money for them, and they can build them fast, but they're still very big plants. I'd always say it would take a year-and-a-half to two years,\" he said.",
      "Wolfers contended that firms will likely not announce plans to set up their factories in the U.S. as long as the uncertainty and instability Trump has started continues.",
      "\"If I'm a firm, what matters to my decision to make a factory is not the tariff rate in 2025 but the tariff rate in 2028 and later,\" he said. \"These tariffs can easily be removed by Democrats or even other Republicans and by the time that factory is up and running, it might be a bad investment.\"",
      "Mosley warned that even if companies do announce plans, their grand plans may not come to fruition as envisioned.",
      "\"I can imagine a few firms that will announce a factory. They figure it curries favor with Trump and he will declare victory, but many firms won't end up committing,\" she said.",
      "A situation like this played out during the Trump first term. In 2018, Trump touted a Foxconn plant in Wisconsin that would build flat panel screens and create 13,000 jobs and invest $10 billion.",
      "\"This is the eighth wonder of the world,\" he boasted then at the announcement.",
      "Three years later, following the pandemic and recession, Foxconn announced it was reducing its investment in the plant to $672 million and dropping its job numbers to roughly 1,400.",
      "Mosely acknowledged that the appeal of blue collar jobs is strong for many Americans; however, she said the economic situation would make it difficult to bring back those jobs and workplaces.",
      "James Anderson, the William B. Neenan, S.J. Millennium Professor in the Economics Department at the Boston College, told ABC News that even if the tariffs are fully overturned, the damage to America's reputation as a strong economic nation has been tarnished and would deter firms from moving to the U.S.",
      "\"What has happened now is that its destroyed the trust in the United States and the destruction of that trust is a generational penalty,\" he said.",
      "Other countries have had better short-term solutions for those workers, such as paid vocational training and \"more generous\" unemployment options to help them transition to their new economies, according to Mosley.",
      "\"This is a massive political problem. The transition is not easy to make,\" she said.",
      "Long term, Wolfers said the U.S. can increase its investment into preparing and training younger generations into the economic sectors that are showing growth, such as tech, and making the country a worldwide leader.",
      "\"It's bizarre to me we are trying to revive the economy of the 1950s when we are on the cusp of a major economic technical revolution,\" he said.",

      "Henrry Josue Villatoro Santos, who is alleged to be in the U.S. illegally, is asking a magistrate judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia to delay the dismissal because he fears the U.S. government would immediately move to deport him to El Salvador's CECOT prison without an opportunity for due process.",
      "Villatoro Santos was arrested at a residence in Virginia on March 27 in a highly-publicized early-morning operation. After he was taken into custody on an outstanding immigration administrative warrant, a search of his room turned up weapons and \"indicia of MS-13 association,\" according to an affidavit from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer.",
      "Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel were in attendance during the early morning raid. At a press conference later that day Bondi said the man arrested in the operation was \"one of the top leaders of MS-13\" and the \"leader of the East Coast\" for the gang. \"He will not be living in our country much longer,\" she added.",
      "Villatoro Santos was charged in federal court with illegal firearm possession and was ordered detained pending trial.",
      "On Wednesday morning, the government filed a terse motion seeking to dismiss the case. The explanation offered was simple, but lacked detail. \"The government no longer wishes to pursue the instant prosecution at this time,\" the motion said.",
      "\"As a terrorist, he will now face the removal process,\" Bondi said in a statement on Wednesday.",
      "That led to the peculiar circumstance of the defendant, Villatoro Santos, asking the court not to immediately end the case.",
      "\"The danger of Mr. Villatoro Santos being unlawfully deported by ICE without due process and removed to El Salvador, where he would almost certainly be immediately detained at one of the worst prisons in the world without any right to contest his removal, is substantial, both in light of the Government's recent actions and the very public pronouncements in this particular case,\" wrote his attorney, Muhammad Elsayed, in a motion to delay the dismissal for two weeks.",
      "Elsayed noted that he was \"keenly aware of the unusual nature\" of the motion.",
      "\"But these are unusual times,\" he wrote, asking the court to delay the entry of any dismissal order for two weeks to allow Villatoro Santos sufficient time to seek assistance from immigration counsel.",

      "Sen. Ted Cruz, who has been one of the Senate's more vocal skeptics of Trump's approach, said he discussed tariffs with Trump over the phone for an hour Tuesday night. He said he advocated that Trump \"use this opportunity to fight for lower tariffs all around and not listen to the voices within his administration that wants to embrace high tariffs in perpetuity.\"",

Kevin Cramer said.",

      "U.S. Space Command says it's finalized options for President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system and has sent its recommendations to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for his review and approval",
      "COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. -- U.S. Space Command said Wednesday that it has finalized options for President Donald Trump's \u201cGolden Dome\u201d missile defense system and has sent its recommendations to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for his review and approval.",
      "The futuristic system was ordered by Trump during his first week in office, and if successful, would mark the first time the U.S. would place weapons in space that are meant to destroy ground-based missiles within seconds of launch.",
      "In his January executive order, Trump gave the military 60 days to provide him recommendations on what an overall system would look like.",
      "Recent developments in hypersonics \u2014 and in particular China's 2021 groundbreaking launch of a warhead system that went into orbit before reentering Earth's atmosphere \u2014 have prompted calls for several years by the U.S. military to develop additional ways to defend against missile strikes.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s time that we can clearly say that we need space fires and we need weapons systems. We need orbital interceptors,\u201d Gen. Stephen Whiting, head of U.S. Space Command, said in a speech kicking off the annual Space Symposium, an industry event held this week in Colorado. \u201cWe call these weapons, and we need them to deter a space conflict and to be successful if we end up in such a fight.\u201d",
      "Multiple options were developed, vetted by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and provided to Hegseth, said Col. Matthew Wroten, Space Command's head of global warfare requirements. He didn't give details on what those options look like.",
      "The Defense Department said it would deliver options to Trump in line with his executive order.",
      "Space Command has not said how much it anticipates a space-based defense will cost, but Wroten said the options sent to Hegseth incorporated estimated costs. This week, Trump said his 2026 defense budget proposal will near $1 trillion.",
      "The program was previously known as Iron Dome but was renamed by the Pentagon in February to Golden Dome.",
      "Wroten said Space Command is now moving forward on developing specific requirements for Golden Dome. Those requirements will be used to weigh what capabilities and \u2014 importantly for defense firms attending the space conference \u2014 what commercially available technologies the military will pursue to get an initial system fielded within a few years.",
      "The administration has said Golden Dome will incorporate existing missile defense systems and new space-based capabilities to form a multilayered defense.",
      "In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan proposed a similar space-based defense, but the Strategic Defense Initiative, also known as \u201cStar Wars,\u201d ultimately did not come to fruition because of technology and cost challenges.",

      "Employees across the Department of the Interior have until the end of Wednesday to respond to the latest offer to take buyouts or early retirement, according to a document obtained by The Associated Press, as the Trump administration continues its efforts to reduce the federal workforce.",
      "The offer for deferred resignation, often described as a buyout, or early retirement was sent April 4 \u2014 one day after Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued an order for national parks to \u201cremain open and accessible\u201d and directing officials to ensure proper staffing.",
      "The memo says the department is also planning for reductions in force \u201cto maximize workforce efficiency,\" but some positions will be exempt from layoffs because they are \u201ccritical to public safety\u201d or \u201cdirectly linked to the highest priority programs.\"",
      "The document, which was sent to assistant secretaries and heads of bureaus and offices, said the buyout and retirement offers were department-wide.",
      "But not all workers can take the buyouts or retire early. Among the workers exempt from the offer are wildland firefighters, law enforcement officers, aviation jobs and cyber security positions.",
      "Some National Park Service jobs are exempt \u2014 those with \u201con-site duties\u201d and those who work at National Wildlife Refuge visitor centers \u2014 with written approval from a senior level, the memo says.",
      "Kristen Brengel, senior vice president of Government Affairs for the National Parks Conservation Association, said the offers are an attempt to pressure dedicated staff to resign or face arbitrary firings.",
      "\u201cThe administration\u2019s relentless attacks are crushing the Park Service,\u201d she said. \u201cPark staff are constantly questioning whether they will be able to perform \u2013 or even keep \u2013 their jobs. Forcing another round of buyouts is yet another reckless action.\"",
      "In response to questions about how many people might take the offer, Interior spokeswoman J. Elizabeth Peace said the department doesn't comment on personnel matters.",
      "Other agencies under Interior include the Bureau of Land Management, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Similar offers were recently made to Department of Homeland Security workers. Their offer includes a lump-sum payment of up to $25,000 in some cases.",

      "An Alabama teen who narrowly survived a fierce shark attack last year is asking her state's lawmakers to support the creation of a new alert system",
      "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- An Alabama teen who narrowly survived a fierce shark attack last year said she hopes a proposed alert system before state lawmakers can help keep others safe in the water.",
      "Lulu Gribbin, now 16, was one of three people bitten by a shark on June 7, 2024, during a string of attacks off the Florida Panhandle. She lost her left hand and a portion of her leg. On Wednesday, she asked Alabama lawmakers to support a proposed shark attack alert system.",
      "The bill by Republican Rep. David Faulkner would establish an alert system, similar to the Amber Alert system, that would issue a notice to the public when there's been an unprovoked shark attack in the vicinity.",
      "\u201cNinety minutes before me, there was another shark attack a couple miles down the coast,\u201d Gribbin said. Had she known about that attack, she and her friend would not have ventured into the water that day, she said. \u201cThis bill will help prevent future attacks and accidents.\u201d",
      "While the proposal would only impact the Alabama coast, Faulkner hopes other states will pursue similar systems or that federal legislation would expand its use.",
      "\u201cThere had been a shark attack just down the beach, and yet she had no notice. And I felt like in this day and age, that\u2019s something we shouldn\u2019t let happen,\u201d Faulkner said.",
      "The Alabama House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee advanced the bill Wednesday. It now moves to the full Alabama House of Representatives.",
      "The bill, which would name the alert system for Gribbin, was changed to issue an alert only when an unprovoked attack occurred off the coast.",
      "An earlier version would have allowed an alert for an \u201cimminent danger\u201d from sharks. There were concerns from beach communities that language was too vague and could lead to an excessive number of alerts, causing panic and potentially hurting the tourism industry.",
      "Gribbin and her friend had been diving for sand dollars before the attack. They were riding the waves back to the beach when her friend screamed, \u201cshark!\"",
      "\u201cI saw a big shadow, but we all just started swimming for our lives,\u201d She recalled. She said she tried to remain calm, remembering that sharks were supposed to be attracted to frantic motion. Then the shark attacked her and her friend.",
      "\"My hand was bitten first. I remember just lifting it out of the water, and I was stunned because there was no hand there. I couldn\u2019t feel it because of all the shock I was in. Then the shark latched onto my leg,\" she recalled.",
      "A man she describes as a hero ran to pull her from the water. She blacked out and came to on the shore where a doctor and other medical workers, who were on the beach that day, rushed to save her. \u201cI remember being focused just to keep my eyes open and to breathe, to just be able to make it to the hospital,\u201d she said.",
      "Her lengthy recovery has been documented on social media. As she visited the Alabama Statehouse, people frequently stopped to ask for photographs and to tell her that her story has been an inspiration.",
      "While sharks are commonly found in the waters off Alabama and Florida, shark attacks are rare, according to experts. There were 47 unprovoked bites last year worldwide, according to the University of Florida\u2019s International Shark Attack File.",
      "Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey on Wednesday urged lawmakers to approve the legislation, saying it will be an \"added tool\" to keep people safe.",
      "\u201cLulu is truly an inspiration and an awesome example of courage. Let\u2019s be Lulu strong and get this bill to my desk so I can sign it into law,\" Ivey said in a statement issued by her office.",

      "Trucks and workers started a cleanup effort at the site of a spill of the Keystone oil pipeline in rural North Dakota",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- Trucks and workers started cleaning up the Keystone oil pipeline spill in rural North Dakota, though its cause and the project timing is unclear.",
      "The pipeline ruptured Tuesday morning in southeastern North Dakota and was shut down within two minutes by an employee who heard a mechanical bang. An aerial photo released Wednesday shows a black, pondlike pool of oil suspended in a partially snowy field that's traversed by tire tracks.",
      "A farmer told The Associated Press he could smell the scent of crude oil, carried by the wind.",
      "South Bow, a liquid pipelines business that manages the pipeline, estimated the spill's volume at 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons. Keystone's entire system remains shut down.",
      "That's not yet known. The company is investigating what caused the spill and how long repairs might take, spokesperson Kristin Anderson said Wednesday.",
      "The spill is not a minor one, said Paul Blackburn, a policy analyst with Bold Alliance, an environmental and landowners group that fought the pipeline's extension, called Keystone XL.",
      "The estimated volume of 3,500 barrels, or 147,000 gallons of crude oil, is equal to 16 tanker trucks of oil, he said. That estimate could increase over time, he added.",
      "Blackburn said the bigger picture is what he called the Keystone Pipeline's history of spills at a higher rate than other pipelines. He compared Keystone to the Dakota Access oil pipeline since the latter came online in June 2017. In that period, Keystone's system has spilled nearly 1.2 million gallons (4.5 million liters) of oil, while Dakota Access spilled 1,282 gallons (4,853 liters), Blackburn said.",
      "In its update, the company said the pipeline \u201cwas operating within its design and regulatory approval requirements at the time of the incident.\u201d",
      "The 2,700-mile (4,350-kilometer) pipeline originates in Alberta, Canada, and carries heavy tar sands crude oil south across the Dakotas and Nebraska before splitting to carry oil both to refineries in Illinois and south to Oklahoma and Texas.",
      "The $5.2 billion Keystone Pipeline was built in 2010. TC Energy built the pipeline which is operated by South Bow as of last year.",
      "The spill is contained to an agricultural field. In an update Wednesday, South Bow said it has multiple on-site vacuum trucks beginning to recover the oil. Continuous air quality monitoring is underway. The pipeline's affected segment is isolated, and the company said it's evaluating plans for a return to service.",
      "Phone messages and emails were left Wednesday with the state Department of Environmental Quality and the Ransom County sheriff about the spill and response.",
      "Myron Hammer, an adjacent landowner who farms the land affected by the spill, said it hasn\u2019t yet adversely affected him, aside from the smell of crude oil or sulfur carrying when the wind blows in a certain direction. The pipeline company appears to be doing its due diligence to fix the problem, he said.",
      "There\u2019s been a lot of truck traffic bringing equipment to the scene, he said. His house is about 1.75 miles (2.82 kilometers) away.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s become a beehive of activity in the proximity there,\u201d Hammer said. Some of his property is being used as a staging area for equipment.",
      "The spill site is north of Fort Ransom, a tiny town in a hilly, forested area known for scenic views and outdoor recreation. A state park and hiking trails are nearby.",
      "They very well might, though energy experts have different outlooks.",
      "The pipeline's shutdown could quickly raise gas prices in the Midwest and could have more effects on diesel and jet fuel because refineries will have less of the crude oil they need, said Ramanan Krishnamoorti, vice president for energy and innovation at the University of Houston.",
      "Higher-priced diesel could lead to higher grocery prices because diesel trucks transport those products, he said.",
      "Other experts said the refineries likely have a supply of crude oil already on hand that would help protect against immediate impacts of the shutdown.",
      "\u201cEven if the pipeline gets cut off completely for, say, 2 or 3 weeks, they have enough crude (oil) to continue refining for gasoline,\u201d said Mark LaCour, editor-in-chief of the Oil and Gas Global Network.",

      "A bill in the California Legislature that would have made oil and gas companies liable for damage to homes caused by natural disasters has failed to advance",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California lawmakers have blocked a bill to make oil and gas companies liable for damage to homes from natural disasters caused by climate change, warning it could raise gas prices.",
      "The bill would have allowed victims of natural disasters, including fires, floods and hurricanes, to sue fossil fuel companies over harm to themselves or their property for damage totaling at least $10,000. Home insurers would also have been able to seek damages under the legislation. The proposal was announced weeks after the Los Angeles-area fires broke out in January, burning thousands of homes and killing at least 30 people.",
      "The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill late Tuesday, with several Democrats abstaining, but left open the possibility for it to be reconsidered later this year. Opponents also said it would threaten jobs in the energy industry by dealing a blow to business, and that it would be difficult to prove a specific company's responsibility for a particular natural disaster.",
      "State Sen. Scott Wiener, a Democrat representing San Francisco who authored the bill, rejected the argument that it would lead to higher gas prices. He said it was about holding the fossil fuel industry accountable for the impacts of climate change. The bill would have eased the burden on disaster survivors and insurance companies to cover damage costs, he said.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s vote is a setback for the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires and for the cost of living in California,\u201d Wiener said in a statement. \u201cVictims of the Eaton and Palisades Fire \u2014 and of all climate disasters \u2014 deserve accountability for the decades of Big Oil lies that devastated their communities.\u201d",
      "When fossil fuels such as oil and gas are burned for energy, carbon dioxide and other emissions enter the Earth's atmosphere, causing the planet to warm. Climate change has made natural disasters more frequent and intense.",
      "State Sen. Anna Caballero, a Democrat representing part of the Central Valley, said ahead of the vote that lawmakers' decision not to support the bill shouldn't be viewed as a move to deprioritize environmental policy. And she said it wouldn't help people who lost their homes to recent fires rebuild.",
      "\u201cIf this was going to actually result in building homes in the fire zones faster, better and with more efficiency, I would probably support it,\u201d she said. \"But from my view, this is more about lawyers. This is about litigation.\u201d",
      "Wiener said it was important for California to remain a climate leader, invoking President Donald Trump's efforts to roll back environmental policies.",
      "Trump signed an executive order Tuesday to identify state rules he said could hinder \u201cAmerica's energy dominance.\u201d He called out California's cap-and-trade program, as well as other climate policies in New York and Vermont.",
      "The California bill's failure to advance comes after lawmakers in recent years blocked a proposal that would have made oil companies liable for the health problems of people who live close to oil wells.",
      "California, a U.S. trendsetter on climate policies, has approved policies over the years to limit emissions from cars, lawn mowers, trucks and trains. But some of those measures have faced threats from the Trump administration. The state Air Resources Board pulled back its requests for federal approval to enforce rules curbing pollution from diesel-powered big rigs and trains ahead of Trump's return to office.",
      "Other major California rules are at risk. Congressional Republicans introduced proposals last week to block state policies approved by President Joe Biden's administration that would ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035, cut tailpipe emissions from medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, and curb smog-forming nitrogen oxide pollution from trucks.",

      "The House has voted to overturn a rule that would have limited bank overdraft fees to $5, following the Senate in moving to dismantle the Biden-era regulation that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau had estimated would save consumers billions of ...",
      "NEW YORK -- The House voted Wednesday to overturn a rule that would have limited bank overdraft fees to $5, following the Senate in moving to dismantle the regulation that the Biden administration had estimated would save consumers billions of dollars.",
      "The resolution killing the rule, which passed the House 217-211, will now head to the White House for President Donald Trump's signature. Republicans argued that the \u201cdisastrous\u201d regulation issued in the final days of President Joe Biden's term would have forced banks to stop offering overdraft protection altogether and made it harder for Americans to access credit.",
      "\u201cCompetition and innovation, not government-mandated price caps, remain the best way to ensure consumers have access to affordable financial products and services,\u201d said Arkansas Rep. French Hill, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee.",
      "Currently, the nation\u2019s biggest banks take in roughly $8 billion in the charges every year, according to data from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and bank public records. Right now, there is no cap on the overdraft fees that banks can legally charge.",
      "Banks and banking groups had previously sued over the rule, arguing that it would have led to consumers leaning on worse, less-regulated services. Republicans voted to undo the regulation under the Congressional Review Act, a 1996 law that allows Congress to reverse recently adopted rules.",
      "Democrats strongly opposed the effort and said the rule would help consumers who can't afford the fees. California Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the Financial Services panel, said that Americans are \u201cfed up with these junk fees\" and want to get them under control.",
      "The rule, scheduled to go into effect in October, was part of Biden's effort to reduce fees that hit consumers on everyday purchases, including banking services. The CFPB estimated the rule would have saved consumers about $5 billion in annual overdraft fees, or $225 per household that typically experiences the fees. Biden had called the fees, which can be as high as $35 per transaction, \u201cexploitative,\u201d and consumer advocates point out they hit banks\u2019 most cash-strapped customers.",
      "The Republican effort to overturn the rule is \u201cshamefully targeting the American people,\" said Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.",
      "When a bank temporarily lends a consumer money after their account has reached a zero balance, the consumer is typically responsible for paying back both the overdrawn amount and an additional fee, which can be more than the original amount charged. In one example, a $3 cup of coffee can end up costing someone more than $30.",
      "Overdraft fees originated during a time when consumers wrote and cashed checks more frequently \u2014 so that the checks would clear instead of bouncing, if there was an issue of timing \u2014 but banks steadily increased the fees in the first two decades of the 2000s. A majority of overdrafts \u2014 about 70% \u2014 are charged to customers with average account balances between $237 and $439, according to the CFPB.",
      "\u201cThe overdraft fee rule close(d) a paper-check era loophole that has allowed big banks to trick people into paying excessive overdraft fees and earn billions in profits from some of their most vulnerable customers,\u201d wrote Chuck Bell, the advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a letter to lawmakers. \u201cOverdraft fees have morph(ed) from an occasional, ad hoc courtesy provided to consumers to a line of business.\u201d",
      "Under the finalized rule, banks would have been able to choose from three options: charging a flat overdraft fee of $5, charging a fee that covered their costs and losses, or charging any fee so long as they disclosed the terms of the overdraft loan the way they would for any other loan, typically expressed as an annual percentage rate, or APR.",
      "The finalized rule applied to banks and credit unions with more than $10 billion in assets, which included the nation\u2019s largest banks. Banks had previously sued the CFPB over these rules and caps on credit card late fees.",
      "\u201cWithout access to overdraft protection, many Americans would be driven to less regulated and higher risk non-bank lenders to cover unexpected or emergency expenses,\" said Rob Nichols, American Banking Association president and CEO, in a statement. Nichols said the rule could have led banks to \u201climit or eliminate overdraft protection as we know it.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A new government task force will consider big changes to America's intelligence community and examine whether material about the origins of COVID-19 and other topics of public interest should be declassified, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said.",
      "Known as the Director's Initiatives Group, the panel will study how intelligence agencies can cut costs in line with recent executive orders from President Donald Trump, the department said Tuesday in a statement announcing the creation of the task force.",
      "The group also will examine ways intelligence agencies have become politicized or weaponized, the department said.",
      "Among its other duties, the panel will review efforts to prevent unauthorized disclosures of classified material and examine whether the government should declassify material regarding the origins of COVID-19 and other issues of public interest, including federal efforts to influence online speech and investigations into mysterious health symptoms reported by some U.S. diplomats and government employees that were once dubbed \u201c Havana syndrome.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump promised the American people maximum transparency and accountability,\" Gabbard wrote in the statement. \u201cWe are committed to executing the president\u2019s vision and focusing the intelligence community on its core mission: ensuring our security by providing the president and policymakers with timely, apolitical, objective, relevant intelligence to inform their decision-making to ensure the safety, security and freedom of the American people.\u201d",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not specify how the task force would be appointed or when it expects to submit its recommendations to Gabbard.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The tariff fight between the world's two largest economies spiraled into greater peril Wednesday as President Donald Trump tried to narrow his global trade war into a direct \u2014 and risky \u2014 faceoff with Beijing.",
      "As Trump r eversed his larger \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs on most of the world in the face of recession fears, he nonetheless hiked his tariffs on China once again \u2014 to 125%. The move locks the strategic rivals into a deepening standoff that endangers both their economies and interests around the world. The stakes are higher than ever, as the U.S. and China are already embroiled in competition on everything from artificial intelligence to monetary policy to overall global influence.",
      "Each nation dares the other to blink first. But the rounds of escalation are raising concerns that the window for diplomacy has narrowed even further, while the economic pain on both economies intensifies.",
      "Behind it all, as usual, geopolitics lurks \u2014 the concerns about regional and global security that are always in play when economic relations between two of the world's most powerful nations turn aggressive.",
      "\u201cWhen you punch the United States of America,\u201d said Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, \u201cPresident Trump is going to punch back harder.\u201d",
      "After Beijing responded to U.S. President Donald Trump's 34% \u201creciprocal\u201d tax on China with the same 34% rate on American goods, Trump raised the tariff by another 50 percentage points, only to be met by the same tariff hike by Beijing on Wednesday morning. U.S. products going to China are now to be taxed 84%.",
      "Hours later, Trump declared that Chinese imports to the United States would be \u201cimmediately\u201d taxed at 125%, citing \u201clack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\u201d Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted this had been Trump's strategy all along and that Beijing has \u201cshown themselves to the world as the bad actors.\u201d",
      "While the financial markets rebounded from their deepest lows at the news that China would be facing the brunt of Trump's wrath, the real-world prospects of the intensifying trade war with China were still set to be significant.",
      "On Wednesday, the U.S.-China Business Council urged the two leaders to \u201ccome to the table\u201d and talk. \u201cTargeted tariffs to encourage China to come to the negotiating table are one thing, but these sweeping tit-for-tat tariffs are in no one\u2019s interests. They will significantly harm the global, U.S., and Chinese economies as well as American businesses, farmers, and consumers,\u201d the council said.",
      "Trump has left little room to negotiate an off-ramp with China, short of that country capitulating \u2014 which would be anathema to Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "\u201cXi will not be forced into a call,\u201d said Sun Yun, director of the China program at the Washington-based think tank Stimson Center. Only once in recent history, she noted, has a Chinese leader phoned the United States without invitation \u2014 after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The trade tensions, if unchecked, could spill into other domains, she warned.",
      "Craig Singleton, the senior China fellow at another Washington-based think tank, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, agreed that a phone call from Beijing is \u201cunlikely in this climate.\u201d",
      "\u201cEach side believes time is on its side, which raises the risk that neither moves to de-escalate until real damage is done,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is no longer about tariffs alone. It\u2019s a test of wills.\u201d",
      "Before Trump's announcement, Bessent called it \u201cunfortunate that the Chinese actually don't want to come and negotiate.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd I can tell you that this escalation is a loser for them,\u201d Bessent said on Fox Business Network\u2019s \u201cMorning with Maria\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cTheir exports to the U.S. are five times our exports to China. So, they can raise their tariffs. But, so what?\u201d",
      "China has its own calculations. Its leadership, overseeing the world's second-largest economy, has vowed not to surrender to U.S. bullying.",
      "While Trump's higher-than-expected tariffs caught other countries by surprise, China says it has been prepared, having learned a lesson from its previous tariff dealings during Trump's first term. In response to Trump's several rounds of tariff raises, Beijing has responded swiftly each time with a package of tariff and non-tariff measures.",
      "\u201cWe have been in a trade war with the United States for eight years and have accumulated rich struggle experience,\u201d said an editorial by the ruling party's flagship newspaper People's Daily, dated Monday.

      "\u201cFacing the impact of U.S. tariff bullying, we possess strong resilience,\u201d the party newspaper said, citing the country's reduced dependence on exports to the U.S. market and new measures to boost domestic consumption.",
      "Since Trump imposed his first round of tariffs on China in 2018, Beijing\u2019s leaders have developed a toolkit of tariffs, import curbs, export controls, sanctions, regulatory reviews and measures to limit companies from doing business in China. All are designed to inflict pain on the U.S. economy and businesses in response to any trade move by the U.S. government.",

      "The country's official Xinhua News Agency, in an editorial, insisted as well that China doesn't want a trade war \u2014 but can fight one.",

      "House Republicans will try to hoist their budget framework to approval despite grave misgivings from conservative GOP lawmakers",
      "WASHINGTON -- With a shove from President Donald Trump, House Republicans will try to hoist their budget framework to approval late Wednesday, despite grave misgivings from conservative GOP lawmakers that allowing trillions of dollars in tax breaks without deep spending cuts will pile onto the nation's debt.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson is almost daring the Republican holdouts to defy Trump and risk upending what the president calls the \u201cbig, beautiful bill,\" which is central to his agenda of tax cuts, mass deportations and a smaller federal government. The GOP speaker cannot afford many defections from his slim majority, thanks to unified Democratic opposition.",
      "Trump on Tuesday night admonished Republicans during a black-tie fundraising dinner at the National Building Museum the night before, saying \u201cYou just got to get there \u2014 close your eyes and get there.\"",
      "\u201cStop grandstanding!\u201d Trump told them, twice for emphasis, to applause.",
      "Pushing the budget framework forward would be a milestone for Johnson, who had set a deadline of the congressional spring break recess Thursday for advancing the resolution. But a failed vote, particularly as the economy is convulsing over Trump's trade wars, would prove a major setback for the embattled speaker and the Republican agenda in Washington.",
      "It's coming as Trump's tariff onslaught has left lawmakers on edge. Hours before the House was ready to vote, Trump paused much of his ambitious tariffs scheme, giving financial markets a bounce after days of turmoil and warnings of a U.S. recession.",
      "\u201cWe are at a critical inflection point, with a generational opportunity,\u201d said Rep. Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, the chair of the House Budget Committee, at a rules meeting ahead of voting.",
      "But House GOP conservatives, including several of those who met personally with Trump at the White House this week, remain concerned that the Senate GOP's blueprint, approved last weekend, does not slash spending to the level they believe is necessary to help prevent soaring deficits.",
      "\u201cThe Math Does Not Add Up,\u201d Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, posted on social media. He said he would not support it.",
      "Wednesday's vote would be another step in a weeks, if not months, long process. The House and Senate must resolve their differences with more votes ahead on the final product later this spring or summer.",
      "Democrats, in the minority, do not have enough votes to stop the package, but have warned against it.",
      "Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle, the ranking Democrat on the budget committee, said whether the House or Senate bill, the proposed GOP budget cuts would deeply harm Medicaid, the health care program used by tens of millions of Americans.",
      "\u201cThis will have a devasting impact on my district, my state \u2014 and all 435 congressional districts throughout our land,\u201d Boyle said.",
      "The budget framework is the centerpiece of the Republican effort to preserve the tax breaks approved in 2017, during Trump's first term, while potentially adding the new ones he promised on the campaign trail. That includes no taxes on tipped wages, Social Security income and others, ballooning the price tag to some $7 trillion over the decade.",
      "The package also allows for budget increases with some $175 billion to pay for Trump's mass deportation operation and as much for the Defense Department to bolster military spending.",
      "It all would be partly paid for with steep cuts to domestic programs, including health care, as part of the $2 trillion in reductions outlined in the House GOP version of the package, though several GOP senators have signaled they are not willing to go that far.",
      "To clip costs, the Senate is using an unusual accounting method that does not count the costs of preserving the 2017 tax cuts, some $4.5 trillion, as new spending, another factor that is enraging the House conservatives.",
      "Two Republican senators voted against their package during an overnight weekend session \u2014 Maine Sen. Susan Collins objected to steep cuts to Medicaid in the House's framework, while Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul argued the whole package relied on \u201cfishy\u201d math that would add to the debt.",
      "The package would also boost the nation's debt limit to allow more borrowing to pay the bills. Trump had wanted lawmakers to take the politically difficult issue off the table. With debt now at $36 trillion, the Treasury Department has said it will run out of funds by August.",
      "But the House and Senate need to resolve their differences on the debt limit, as well. The House GOP raises the debt limit by $4 trillion, but the Senate GOP boosted it to $5 trillion so the Congress would not have to revisit the issue again until after the fall 2026 midterm election.",
      "With Trump's trade wars hovering over the debate, House Republicans tucked a provision into a procedural vote that would prevent House action \u2013 as the Senate has taken \u2013 to disapprove of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "Garcia-Aquino, 43, was charged with one count of murder, with the special circumstance allegation of murder during the commission or attempted commission of lewd acts with a child. The charges make him eligible for the death penalty or life in prison without the possibility of parole.",

      "The prospect of high inflation stemming from widespread tariffs along with weaker hiring could put the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot, Fed policymakers said in minutes from last month\u2019s meeting",
      "WASHINGTON -- The prospect of high inflation stemming from widespread tariffs along with weaker hiring could put the Federal Reserve in a difficult spot, Fed policymakers said in minutes from last month's meeting.",
      "The minutes, released Wednesday, said that the Fed could keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged if inflation remained stubbornly elevated. And they said it could cut its rate if growth slowed and unemployment rose. The minutes were for the Fed's March 18-19 meeting.",
      "But if both happened at the same time, the Fed \u201cmay face difficult tradeoffs,\u201d some of the 19 officials on the central bank's interest-rate setting committee said. Rising unemployment can often lead to a recession, when the Fed would normally slash its key rate to support more borrowing and spending and stimulate the economy. Yet Fed officials would likely be reluctant to cut if inflation rose, because it usually seeks to cool higher prices by keeping its key rate unchanged \u2014 or even raising it if necessary.",
      "The minutes reflect discussions among Fed officials before President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs April 2 on nearly 60 countries, along with a 10% tariff on nearly all nations. Trump said Wednesday that he had paused the tariffs for 90 days, though the 10% duty would remain, as well as a huge 125% tax on imports from China.",
      "The minutes also said that the tariffs that had been announced prior to the March meeting \u2014 on steel, aluminum, and on many imports from Canada and Mexico \u2014 had already caused many companies to delay hiring and raise prices.",
      "Several Fed officials, according to the minutes, said that their business contacts \u201cwere already reporting increases in costs, possibly in anticipation of rising tariffs,\u201d or \u201chad indicated willingness to pass on to consumers higher input costs that would arise from potential tariff increases.\u201d",
      "Many of those same business contacts \u201creported pausing hiring decisions because of elevated policy uncertainty,\u201d the minutes said.",
      "In remarks last Friday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the April 2 tariffs would likely raise inflation and slow growth. He also noted that their impact would likely be temporary, but said there was a heightened chance that they could persistently raise inflation.",
      "Inflation has come down sharply from its peak in June 2022, but it has remained stubbornly elevated even before the imposition of duties. Consumer prices were 2.8% higher in February compared to a year ago, though March figures will be released early Thursday and are expected to show inflation declining to 2.6%.",

      "Three Americans repatriated to the United States from Congo have been charged by the U.S. Justice Department with staging an elaborate coup attempt aimed at overthrowing the African nation\u2019s government",
      "SALT LAKE CITY -- Three Americans repatriated to the United States from Congo this week were charged Wednesday by the U.S. Justice Department with staging an elaborate coup attempt aimed at overthrowing the African nation\u2019s government.",
      "A fourth man alleged by prosecutors to be a bomb-making expert was also charged for aiding the plot.",
      "The complaint stems from allegations that led to three of the defendants being detained in Congo and receiving death sentences. The sentences were later commuted to punishments of life imprisonment.",
      "Following a long-running FBI investigation, the Justice Department accused the men of providing training, weapons and other support to a rebel army that was formed to try to overthrow the government last year.",
      "Among the three Americans is 22-year-old Marcel Malanga, son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga livestreamed from the palace during the attempt and was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said.",
      "Prosecutors say the goal of the plot was to establish a new government known as New Zaire and install Christian Malanga as its president. The younger Malanga identified himself as the \u201cChief of Staff of the Zaire army\u201d and acted as a leader of the rebel forces, court documents say.",
      "Christian Malanga, who was born in the Congolese capital of Kinshasa, had described himself on his website as a refugee who settled in the U.S. with his family in the 1990s. The self-proclaimed leader of a shadow government in exile sold used cars and dabbled in gold mining before persuading his Utah-born son to join in the foiled coup. Christian Malanga was convicted in Utah of assault with a firearm in 2001 and had charges dismissed in several other criminal cases.",
      "Defendants Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., 22, and Benjamin Zalman-Polun, 37, were returned to the U.S. Tuesday. They were expected to make their first court appearance in Brooklyn.",
      "The alleged explosives expert, Joseph Peter Moesser, 67, was due to appear in court in Salt Lake City Thursday.",
      "Thompson\u2019s attorney, Skye Lazaro, said Wednesday she did not yet have information to share. No attorneys were listed in court documents for the other three defendants.",
      "The men are charged with crimes including conspiracy to use weapons of mass destruction, conspiracy to bomb places of government facilities and conspiracy to kill or kidnap persons in a foreign country. Those charges, which taken together could result in lengthy prison sentences in the event of a conviction, could change once the defendants are indicted by a grand jury.",
      "The complaint provides the most detailed chronicle to date of the planned May 2024 overthrow of Congolese President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi. At least six people, including Christian Malanga, died when men in camouflage fatigues led an attack on the homes of the president and a deputy prime minister.",
      "Prosecutors are seeking to keep all four men in jail as the case moves forward.",
      "\u201cThe four defendants pose an extreme danger to the community and present an unmanageable risk of flight,\" the Justice Department said in a detention memo.",
      "It notes that Moesser, a longtime associate of Christian Malanga, faced allegations of criminal conduct years earlier when he was accused of trying to place explosive black powder on an plane departing from the Salt Lake City airport. He wound up pleading guilty to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to a form of probation.",
      "The charging document makes clear that the alleged coup was the result of a months-in-the-making plot rather than a haphazard idea, with the men accused of recruiting friends in the U.S., acquiring a drone and military-style weapons and also participating in extensive firearms training.",
      "Malanga told a Congolese judge that his father threatened to kill him if he did not follow his orders.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re about to go take out some terrorists,\u201d Malanga is alleged to have told a friend he was recruiting to go to Africa. The friend is not named in the complaint.",
      "Other friends told The Associated Press Malanga had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a mysterious \u201csecurity job\u201d in Congo.",
      "Thompson, a friend and former high school football teammate of Marcel Malanga in Utah, is identified in court documents as a drone specialist who prosecutors say shopped for a flamethrower attachment that he planned to use to \u201clight people on fire.\u201d His family has said he flew to Africa for what they believed was his first vacation abroad, paid for by Christian Malanga.",
      "Witnesses observed Thompson and the younger Malanga conducting drone test flights and firing handguns and rifles at a shooting range near Salt Lake City before they left for Africa, according to the complaint.",
      "Moesser allegedly helped Thompson and Malanga install the flamethrower attachment and showed them how to use drones to drop pipe bombs. Messages obtained by investigators show Moesser conspiring with Christian Malanga to ship explosives and AR-15 rifles to Congo, the complaint said.",
      "Zalman-Polun reportedly traveled to Utah to help Malanga recruit soldiers for their rebel army. If the plot had been successful, Zalman-Polun would have become Christian Malanga's chief of staff or would \u201cwork in finance\u201d in the new administration, according to court documents.",
      "The complaint also places three of the defendants at the scene itself, using images and posts from the men\u2019s social media accounts.",
      "Livestream videos taken from Christian Malanga\u2019s social media platform depict him filming his son lifting a weapon and demonstrating his shooting form at the Palais de la Nation, the president\u2019s official residence, according to the complaint. The men are also alleged to have hijacked a bus and raided a police station to obtain weapons for the deadly attack.",

In that case from 1935, the court unanimously held that presidents cannot fire independent board members without cause.",
      "The ruling has long rankled conservative legal theorists, who argue it wrongly curtails the president\u2019s power. The current conservative majority on the Supreme Court already has narrowed its reach, in a 2020 decision.",

      "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Eric Adams ' administration is allowing federal immigration officials to operate at Rikers Island to work on gang and drug-related criminal investigations in the city's largest lockup.",
      "But immigrant rights groups and Adams\u2019 critics cast the Tuesday executive order as a concerning quid pro quo after federal prosecutors dropped corruption charges against the Democrat so he could help support the Republican President Donald Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Adams announced plans to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to resume operations at the jail in February after meeting with Trump border czar Tom Homan, though details of the arrangement weren\u2019t released until Tuesday's order.",
      "The Rikers Island jail complex, on a hard-to-reach island in the East River, has long suffered from rampant disorder and neglect and faces a possible federal takeover.",
      "The order authorizes ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations division, which focuses on transnational crime, to have an office at the jail to work with city corrections officials on criminal investigations and \u201crelated intelligence sharing\u201d efforts focused on violent criminals and gangs, crimes committed in jails and drug trafficking.",
      "ICE used to have a presence on Rikers to facilitate the transfer of immigrants who were in the U.S. illegally into federal custody for deportation. But the city\u2019s 2014 sanctuary law effectively banned ICE operations in its jails.",
      "The order from the mayor's office also allows other federal agencies, including the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, to have office space at the jail to assist with gang and drug-related investigations.",
      "City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said the Rikers decision is among a series of \u201chighly troubling recent events\u201d since Adams' criminal charges were dropped.",
      "\u201cIt is hard not to see this action as connected to the dismissal of the Mayor\u2019s case and his willingness to cooperate with Trump\u2019s extreme deportation agenda that is removing residents without justification or due process,\u201d the council speaker said in a statement.",
      "The Democrat, who is not related to the mayor and is challenging him in the upcoming election, said the council is reviewing the order to see if it conforms with the city\u2019s sanctuary law.",
      "Mayor Adams brushed aside suggestions of a quid pro quo.",
      "\u201cThere is no beholdening,\u201d he said during a radio interview Wednesday.",
      "The mayor also stressed that the order expressly states that federal officers operating at Rikers would not be allowed to conduct immigration enforcement that isn\u2019t related to criminal cases.",
      "\u201cWe cannot collaborate with ICE on civil enforcement, but we can for criminal enforcement. That is what we are doing,\u201d he told WINS. \u201cThat\u2019s in complete conformity with the law.\u201d",
      "Randy Mastro, Adams\u2019 first deputy mayor who issued the order, noted the city had a similar arrangement with ICE more than a decade ago. This time, though, the focus will be exclusively on criminal investigations, he said.",
      "\u201cThis is about public safety and protecting all New Yorkers,\u201d Mastro said in a statement.",

      "Weinstein\u2019s lawyers said they may seek to call the notetaking assistant district attorney as a witness, disqualifying her from working on the case, as they seek to undermine the accuser\u2019s credibility.

      "\u201cOf course, as noted in the court order, agencies are permitted to carry on their ordinary course of business which carries with it the authority to decide with whom to work,\u201d it adds.",
      "It later adds: \u201cAs it remains the Executive Branch\u2019s position that Executive Order 14246 was necessary policy the government reserves the right to take all necessary and legal actions regarding \u2018lawfare,\u2019 national security concerns, and discriminatory practices involving Jenner & Block.\u201d",
      "That assertion could place the administration in conflict with the order from Bates, which directed the Trump administration to inform federal agencies to disregard broad swaths of its executive order. A separate provision of the order, mandating the suspension of active security clearances of employees at the firm, remains unaffected by the judge's ruling.",
      "Jenner & Block lawsuit, as well as WilmerHale, another firm targeted by an executive order, asked federal judges on Tuesday to permanently block enforcement of the orders against them.",
      "The executive order against Jenner & Block stemmed at least in par from the fact the firm once employed Andrew Weissmann, a lawyer who served on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team that investigated Trump during his first term in office over potential connections between his 2016 campaign and Russia. Weissmann, a frequent public target of Trump\u2019s ire, left the firm several years ago.",
      "Mueller has retired from WilmerHale, but a White House executive order targeting that firm mentioned him as well as another retired partner and a current partner who all served on Mueller\u2019s team.",
      "Besides Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, other firms targeted by executive order include Perkins Coie and Covington & Burling.",
      "Last month, after being confronted with a similar order, Paul Weiss struck a deal with the White House that resulted in the order being rescinded. Three other firms \u2014 Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, as well as Millbank and Willkie, Farr & Gallagher \u2014 have reached settlements with the Trump administration before they could be subject to an order.",

      "Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is calling for Democrats and Republicans to work together to help boost American manufacturing",
      "LANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer delivered a speech emphasizing points of agreement with President Donald Trump on economic policy, just hours before their scheduled meeting \u2014 a reflection of the high-profile Democrat\u2019s more diplomatic approach toward the president as her party ramps up its attacks on him.",
      "Framed by Whitmer as a \u201cblueprint for success,\u201d her lengthy \u201cBuild, America, Build\u201d address called for bipartisan cooperation to boost American manufacturing. While she offered soft criticism of the president, she also underscored shared priorities.",
      "\u201cI understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you, here\u2019s where President Trump and I do agree. We do need to make more stuff in America,\u201d said Whitmer, before adding, \u201cI\u2019m not against tariffs outright, but it is a blunt tool. You can\u2019t just pull out the tariff hammer to swing at every problem without a clear defined end-goal.\u201d",
      "The address, rescheduled from last week due to severe ice storms in northern Michigan, came ahead of her second one-on-one meeting with Trump in less than a month, in addition to a dinner at the White House where she sat next to him.",
      "Trump praised Whitmer as a \u201cvery good person\u201d who has done an \u201cexcellent job\u201d Wednesday afternoon, as the high-profile Democrat stood in the Oval Office while he signed executive orders and took aim at political opponents. Trump added that \u201cwe'll come home with a winner for Michigan.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s meeting follows Trump\u2019s announcement of new tariffs expected to disproportionately affect Michigan, whose economy is closely tied to an auto industry reliant on trade with Canada, Mexico and other countries. She added that she would also be meeting with members of Trump's Cabinet, and she planned to discuss the impact of tariffs.",
      "Once one of Trump\u2019s most vocal critics during his first term and the campaign trail last year, Whitmer has adopted a more measured tone toward the president since his reelection, delivering multiple speeches in which she has called for finding \u201ccommon ground.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re not at the table, you\u2019re on the menu,\u201d Whitmer said during a discussion after her speech. \u201cMy oath to the people of Michigan is to continue to show up, even when it means I\u2019m going to get my lunch handed to me.\u201d",
      "Whitmer\u2019s approach stands in sharp contrast to that of other high-profile Democratic governors, many of whom \u2014 like her \u2014 are seen as potential contenders for the party\u2019s 2028 presidential nomination.",
      "Colorado's Democratic Gov. Jared Polis directly responded to Whitmer's speech Wednesday, saying the \u201ctariff hammer\u201d Whitmer referred to \u201cwinds up hitting your own hand rather than the nail.\u201d",
      "\u201cTariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,\u201d Polis said on social media.",
      "Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has remained a leading voice of state-level opposition to Trump, sharply criticizing the new tariffs this week. Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom appealed directly to international partners, urging them to spare his state from retaliatory measures and declaring, \u201cCalifornia is not Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "Whitmer faces a more challenging political landscape than either Pritzker or Newsom, with a divided state legislature and a state that went for Trump in two of the last three elections. But even Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, the Democratic governor of a state that voted for Trump in 2024, has taken a more critical approach toward Trump, telling reporters Tuesday that Trump is \u201clooking to screw over our farmers\u201d with tariffs.",
      "Whitmer's balance was seen in her address Wednesday and the conversation with former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson afterward. She agreed with Trump on the need to build more in America, but made it clear that she disagrees with his approach to tariffs, emphasizing that such a shift \u201cdoesn\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a shortcut here. Strategic reindustrialization must be a bipartisan project that spans multiple presidential administrations,\u201d Whitmer said in her address. \u201cWe need to be strategic about tariffs on the technology we actually want to make in America.\u201d",
      "Whitmer \u2014 who has less than two years left in office because of term limits \u2014 has spent much of this year traveling outside Michigan on international trade trips and visits to Washington, D.C., and other states, following a 2024 in which she dedicated considerable time campaigning for fellow Democrats.",
      "Despite this, she reiterated on Wednesday that she is not signaling a run for president in 2028, though her speech is unlikely to quiet the speculation.",
      "\u201cThis year and in the years to come \u2014 no matter who\u2019s in the White House \u2014 we need to be betting on American workers. We need to bring chip manufactures back home. Let\u2019s dominate the seas and the skies and the roads. Let\u2019s innovate and let\u2019s build,\u201d Whitmer said in closing.",

      "The meeting came a day after Meyer attended the Pakistan Minerals Investment Forum, an international summit aimed at attracting foreign investment in the country\u2019s mining sector. Apart from gold and copper, Pakistan is also rich in lithium used to make batteries, as well as other minerals.",

      "For most other nations, Donald Trump has paused implementing higher taxes on US imports for 90 days.",
      "It means that those countries will now face a lower levy of 10% - the same level as Trump as imposed on the UK when he made his initial announcement last week.",
      "The UK appeared to have come off lightly compared to other economies.",
      "But, British exporters still face an extra charge on goods sold into the US and there are many other ways the UK will be affected, from growth to inflation.",
      "The exact impact remains very uncertain. But some of the emerging fallout may have an upside - and here's why.",
      "Business",
      "Those most directly exposed in the UK to this trade war are British businesses - from carmakers to food producers - selling goods into the US.",
      "As American importers buying their products pay 10% more, they face a dilemma of whether to squeeze profits, share the pain across the supply chain or hope customers will be prepared to pay higher prices.",
      "They already risk a dent to their sales from tariffs, threatening jobs and investment plans. Other companies too could be squeezed by more competition, if cheap imports from other nations are diverted to the UK - China makes a third of global goods.",
      "And the complexities of global supply chains means UK business will notice the impact of tariffs in other nations.",
      "Growth",
      "The blow to growth via trade will likely be less marked in the UK than elsewhere, in part because of what Britain sells to America.",
      "Two-thirds of British exports to the UK are services - the likes of banking, insurance  and advertising - which aren't subject to tariffs. The UK's success in this area makes it a particular area of strength in its trade portfolio.",
      "But that strength can also be a weakness.",
      "Some services exports are linked to goods; think after-sales services or marketing. The demand for those could be affected by tariffs in the US.",
      "Sales of services exports could more broadly be impacted elsewhere if demand from other countries suffers.",
      "Some in the advertising industry are already fretting because spending on their services are often to first to suffer when there are budget cutbacks.",
      "And that trade success could be a vulnerability.",
      "The Bank of England notes that the size of the UK's export sector compared to the economy, and its financial sector, means it may be susceptible to risks to financial stability from weaker global growth.",
      "It's for all these reasons that Chancellor Rachel Reeves is warning that growth in the UK will be hit, even if we're now on a level playing field with other countries in terms of the 10% tariff.",
      "That's worrying, not just for households and businesses, but for the chancellor's own sums - weaker growth puts more of a strain on the public finances.",
      "That's why there's been speculation that we may see more tax rises come the Autumn Budget, if she's to stick to her fiscal rules.",
      "ISAs and pensions",
      "Compounding that dilemma - potentially  - are movements in the bond markets.",
      "Those are usually seen as safe investments in times of strife but there has been signs of heavy-selling, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for governments.",
      "And the wild swings in stock markets around the world, egged on by the heightened risk of global recession, have not been good news for investors in the UK.",
      "When share prices drop, they reduce the value of products such as ISAs and pension funds.",
      "But as seasoned analysts caution that those sort of funds are long-term ones. Swings in the value of investments tend to get smoothed out over time - and most people aren't drawing from such funds day-to-day.  On the whole, households here are less exposed to the stock market directly than those in America are.",
      "Interest rates",
      "There may be a silver lining to the market volatility.",
      "Prices of oil and commodities such as copper and sugar have been falling.",
      "That may bode well for lower inflation as might the diversion of cheap goods from countries struggling to sell in the US.",
      "Against a backdrop of weaker growth, investors are speculating that the Bank of England may cut interest rates four more times this year, touting potential relief for millions of  households.",
      "The Bank of England itself has noted that, in any case, British households are well placed to weather the storm; our debt relative to our incomes is at its lowest level since 2001.",
      "Moreover, the banking system, the Bank judges, is well placed to absorb shocks; lessons from the 2008 financial crisis have been leant.",

      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work will without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",

      "Governments sell bonds - essentially an IOU - to raise money from financial markets for public spending and in return they pay interest.",
      "The US does not normally see high interest rates on its debt as its bonds are viewed as a safe investment, but on Wednesday rates spiked sharply to touch 4.5%.",
      "The rise came after Trump pressed ahead with sweeping tariffs on goods being imported into the US, while Washington's trade war with China escalated further - although Trump on Wednesday did put a 90-day pause on higher tariffs for some countries.",
      "After the US implemented a 104% tariff on products from China at midnight on Wednesday, Beijing hit back with 84% levy on American products. Trump later raised the tariff on China to 125%.",
      "Stock markets have been falling sharply over the past few days in reaction to the escalating global trade war and fears of tariffs leading to higher prices, although US stocks soared when Trump announced the 90-day pause and a lowered 10% reciprocal tariff for other countries.",
      "However, the sale of bonds in the US poses a major problem for the world's biggest economy.",
      "The interest rate - or yield - for US government borrowing over 10 years has spiked sharply in the past couple of days from 3.9% to 4.5%, the highest level since February.",

      "\"Rising bond yields mean higher costs for companies to borrow, and of course governments too,\" said Laith Khalaf, head of investment analysis at AJ Bell.",
      "\"Bonds should do well in times of turmoil as investors flee to safety, but Trump's trade war is now undermining the US debt market,\" he added.",
      "While interest rates on US government debt rose, the price of the bonds themselves fell as demand weakened due to investors offloading them.",
      "Mohammed El Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz and former boss of the biggest bond manager Pimco, said one reason US borrowing costs had shot up was because there had been an \"erosion\" of bonds being seen as a safe haven.",
      "He added concerns over the impact of tariffs on inflation and US government budgets were also reasons.",
      "Will the Federal Reserve step in?",
      "Some analysts suggested that America's central bank - the US Federal Reserve -  might be forced to step in if turbulence continues, in a move reminiscent of the Bank of England's emergency action in 2022 following Liz Truss's mini-Budget.",
      "\"We see no other option for the Fed but to step in with emergency purchases of US Treasuries to stabilise the bond market,\" said George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank.",

      "Trump's plan is aimed at protecting American businesses from foreign competition and also to boost domestic manufacturing.",
      "However, tumbling stock markets resulting from fears extra taxes will hit the profits of companies, could lead ultimately to firms cutting jobs and an economic downturn.",
      "'US recession a coin toss'",
      "JP Morgan, the investment banking giant, has raised the likelihood of a US recession from 40% to 60% and warned that American policy was \"tilting away from growth\".",
      "Simon French, chief economist at Panmure Liberum, told the BBC that the Fed could decide to cut interest rates in a bid to protect US jobs by making it easier for businesses to borrow cash as they face higher costs from tariffs.",
      "He said it was a \"coin toss\" over whether the US would enter a recession.",
      "This is defined as a prolonged and widespread decline in economic activity typically characterised by a jump in unemployment and fall in incomes.",

    "summary": "US exports have driven the economic success of countries like Vietnam and Cambodia.",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs targeting most of the world are now in effect \u2013 and outside China, no other region has been hit as hard as South East Asia.",
      "Near the top of the list are Vietnam and Cambodia which have been hit by some of the highest tariffs: 46% and 49%.  Further down are Thailand (36%), Indonesia (32%) and Malaysia (24%). The Philippines gets a tariff of 17%, and Singapore of 10%.",
      "This is a huge blow for a region highly dependent on exports. Its widely admired economic development over the past three decades has largely been driven by its success in selling its products to the rest of the world, in particular to the US.",
      "Exports to the US contribute around 30% of Vietnam's GDP, and 25% of Cambodia's.",
      "That growth story is now imperilled by the punitive measures being imposed in Washington.",
      "The longer-term impact of these tariffs, assuming they stay in place, will vary, but will certainly pose big challenges to the governments of Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia in particular.",
      "As Trump hikes tariffs again, nervous businesses weigh what comes next",
      "China is not backing down from Trump's tariff war. What next?",
      "Vietnam's \"bamboo diplomacy\", where it attempts to be friends with everyone and balance ties with both China and the US, will now be tested.",
      "Under the leadership of the new Communist Party Secretary-General To Lam, Vietnam has embarked on an ambitious plan to build an upper-income, knowledge-and-tech-based economy by the year 2045. It has been aiming for annual growth rates in excess of 8%.",
      "Exporting more to the US, already its biggest market, was central to that plan.",
      "It was also the main reason why Vietnam agreed to elevate their relationship to that of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.",
      "The Communist Party, which tolerates little dissent and has no formal political opposition, depends on its economic pledges for its legitimacy. Already viewed by many economists as too ambitious, these will now be even harder to meet.",
      "Thailand depends on US exports less than Vietnam \u2013 under 10% of GDP \u2013 but the Thai economy is in much worse shape, having underperformed for the past decade. The Thai government is trying to find ways to lift economic growth, most recently attempting but failing to legalise gambling, and these tariffs are another economic blow it cannot afford.",
      "For Cambodia, the tariffs pose perhaps the greatest political threat in the region.",
      "The government of Hun Manet has proved just as authoritarian as that of his father Hun Sen, whom he succeeded two years ago, but it is vulnerable.",
      "Keeping the Hun family's hold on power has required offering rival clans in Cambodia economic privileges like monopolies or land concessions, but this has helped create a glut of property developments, which are no longer selling, and a mass of grievances over land expropriations.",
      "The garment sector, which employs 750,000 people, has been a crucial social safety valve, giving steady incomes to Cambodia's poorest. Thousands of those jobs are now likely to be lost as a result of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Unlike China, which has hit back with its own levies, the official message from governments in South East Asia is don't panic, don't retaliate, but negotiate.",
      "Vietnam has dispatched deputy prime minister Ho Duc Phoc to Washington to plead his country's case, and has offered to eliminate all tariffs on US imports. Thailand plans to send its finance minister to make a similar appeal, and has offered to reduce its tariffs and buy more American products, like food and aircraft.",
      "Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim is also heading to Washington, though with  exports to the US making up only 11% of Malaysia's total, his country is less affected than some of its neighbours.",
      "However, the Trump administration appears to be in no mood to compromise.",
      "Peter Navarro, President Trump's senior counsellor on trade and manufacturing and one of the main thinkers behind the new policy, said in interviews on Monday that Vietnam's offer of zero tariffs was meaningless, because it would not address the deficit in trade where Vietnam sells $15 worth of goods to the US for every $1 it buys.",
      "He accused Vietnam of keeping multiple non-tariff barriers to US imports, and said that one-third of all Vietnamese exports to the US were actually Chinese products, trans-shipped through Vietnam.",
      "The proportion of Vietnamese exports which are being made or trans-shipped there to avoid US tariffs on China is difficult to assess, but detailed trade studies put it at between 7% and 16%, not one-third.",
      "Like Vietnam, the government of Cambodia has appealed to the US to postpone the tariffs while it attempts to negotiate.",
      "The local American Chamber of Commerce has called for the 49% tariffs to be dropped, making the point that the Cambodian garment industry, the country's biggest employer, will be badly affected, but that no tariff level, however high, will see clothing and footwear manufacturing return to the US.",
      "Perhaps the most perverse tariff rate is the 44% applied to Myanmar, a country mired in a civil war, which has no capacity to buy more US goods.",
      "US exports make up only a small proportion of Myanmar's GDP, less than 1%.",
      "But as in Cambodia, that sector, mainly garments, is one of the few that provides a steady income to poor families in Myanmar's cities.",
      "In a supreme irony,  Trump has until now been a popular figure in this region.",
      "He has been widely admired in Vietnam for his tough, transactional approach to foreign policy, and Cambodia's former strongman Hun Sen, still the main power behind the scenes, has long sought a close personal relationship with the US president, proudly posting selfies with him at their first meeting in 2017.",
      "Only last month Cambodia was praising  Trump for shutting down the US media networks Voice of America and Radio Free Europe, which often carried the views of Cambodian dissidents.",
      "Now Cambodia, like so many of its neighbours, finds itself in a long line of supplicants pleading with him to ease their tariff burden.",

      "The repo rate is the level at which the central bank lends to commercial banks, influencing borrowing costs.",
      "The RBI also brought down its growth projections for this year from 6.7% to 6.5%. It said India's gross domestic product (GDP) will grow at 6.5% next year as well.",
      "Crucially, the RBI shifted its monetary policy stance to \"accommodative\" from \"neutral\", which means that the central bank would be more open to cutting rates in the future to stimulate a slowing economy.",
      "\"Concerns on trade frictions are coming true\" and unsettling the global community, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said in his speech, adding that headwinds from disruptions to trade would continue to pose challenges for the economy.",
      "Most economists who had previously expected only one more rate cut this year are now predicting more softening as Trump's tariff war puts growth in the world's fastest growing major economy at risk.",
      "\"The magnitude of rate cuts in the cycle now could be as high as 100bps (1%),\" ICICI Bank said in a note, a view echoed by many other analysts.",
      "Moderating inflation will give the RBI further elbow room to slash borrowing costs, according to several brokerages, as growth momentum further loses steam due to Trump's global trade war.",
      "HSBC calculates GDP could take a direct hit of as much as half a percent this financial year due to slower export volumes around the world and weaker inflows of foreign funds.",
      "The government's capacity to stimulate the economy  to counter the impact of Trump's tariffs is also limited because \"spending and tax revenues have lost steam in recent months\", according to HSBC.",
      "Starting Wednesday, Indian goods being exported to the US will face additional tariffs of up to 27%.",

      "How will India navigate a world on the brink of a trade war?",
      "The final impact on India's trade will depend on \"how long the announced tariff structure lasts\", ratings agency Crisil said. \"The outcome will also be influenced by how other countries retaliate or negotiate with the US on tariffs.\"",
      "China has already retaliated by imposing 34% reciprocal tariffs on US imports, while Europe is considering counter-measures.",
      "India on the other hand has assumed a more restrained stance and is working towards concluding a trade deal with the US.",
      "India has \"agreed on the importance of the early conclusion of the Bilateral Trade Agreement\", Foreign Minister S Jaishankar said on X (formerly Twitter) this week after his meeting with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "But even with a trade deal in place, India's economy is unlikely to be immune to a slowdown in other parts of the world with demand for its exports potentially reducing in the event of global growth falling off a cliff.",
      "Wall Street bank JP Morgan has put the chance of a global recession at 60%, while ratings agency Moody's said the odds had risen from 15% to 35% due to tariffs.",
      "At 6.5%, India continues to remain the world's fastest growing major economy, but its growth has sharply come off the 9.2% high recorded in financial year 2023-24."

      "The ex-employees agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under non-disclosure agreements.",

      "The trade war between the world's two biggest economies shows no signs of slowing down - Beijing has vowed to \"fight to the end\" hours after US President Donald Trump threatened to nearly double the tariffs on China.",
      "That could leave most Chinese imports facing a staggering 104% tax - a sharp escalation between the two sides.",

      "Meanwhile, China has hit back with tit-for-tat levies - 34% - and Trump warned that he would retaliate with an additional 50% tariff if Beijing doesn't back down.",
      "Uncertainty is high, with more tariffs, some more than 40%, set to kick in on Wednesday. Many of these would hit Asian economies: tariffs on China would rise to 54%, and those on Vietnam and Cambodia, would soar to 46% and 49% respectively.",

      "This time too it has announced retaliatory tariffs, but it also appears to be bracing for pain with stronger measures. It has allowed its currency, the yuan, to weaken, which makes Chinese exports more attractive. And state-linked enterprises have been buying up shares in what appears to be a move to stabilise the market.",
      "The prospect of negotiations between the US and Japan seemed to buoy investors who were fighting to claw back some of the losses of recent days.",

      "\"The tariffs exacerbate this problem,\" said Andrew Collier, Senior Fellow at the Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government at Harvard Kennedy School.",
      "If China's exports take a hit, that hurts a crucial revenue stream. Exports have long been a key factor in China's explosive growth. And they remain a significant driver, although the country is trying to diversify its economy with high-end tech manufacturing and greater domestic consumption.",
      "It's hard to say exactly when the tariffs \"will bite but likely soon,\" Mr Collier says, adding that \"[President Xi] faces an increasingly difficult choice due to a slowing economy and dwindling resources\".",

      "\"You can only tariff so much for so long. But there are other ways both countries can hit each other. So you might say it can't possibly get worse, but there are many ways in which it can.\"",
      "The rest of the world is watching too, to see where Chinese exports shut out of the US market will go.",
      "They will end up in other markets such as those in South East Asia, Ms Elms adds, and \"these places [are dealing] with their own tariffs and having to think about where else can we sell our products?\"",
      "\"So we are in a very different universe, one that is really murky.\"",
      "How does this end?",
      "Unlike the trade war with China during Trump's first term, which was about negotiating with Beijing, \"it's unclear what is motivating these tariffs and it's very hard to predict where things might go from here,\" says Roland Rajah, lead economist at the Lowy Institute.",
      "China has a \"wide toolkit\" for retaliation, he adds, such as depreciating their currency further or clamping down on US firms.",
      "\"I think the question is how restrained will they be? There's retaliation to save face and there's pulling out the whole arsenal. It's not clear if China wants to go down that path. It just might.\"",
      "Some experts believe the US and China may engage in private talks. Trump is yet to speak to Xi since returning to the White House, although Beijing has repeatedly signalled its willingness to talk.",
      "But others are less hopeful.",
      "\"I think the US is overplaying its hand,\" Ms Elms says. She is sceptical of Trump's belief that the US market is so lucrative that China, or any country, will eventually bend.",

      "\"Boys will be boys, and we will let their public sparring continue,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Trump has in part justified his global wave of tariffs by saying he wants to revive manufacturing in the US. This is an argument Navarro made during an appearance on CNBC on Monday.",

      "\"We're going to get to a place where America makes stuff again, real wages are going to be up, profits are going to be up,\" Navarro added.",
      "Responding to the comments on Tuesday, Musk posted a link to a 2023 article by car valuation firm Kelley Blue Book, which cited Cars.com findings that Tesla vehicles had the most parts produced in the US.",
      "\"By any definition whatsoever, Tesla is the most vertically integrated auto manufacturer in America with the highest percentage of US content,\" Musk wrote in a follow-up post.",
      "Technology industry analyst Dan Ives said the company was less exposed to tariffs than other US car makers such as GM, Ford, and Stellantis.",

    "story": [
      "Markets are reeling from US President Donald Trump's tariff announcements, but the American leader is standing by his decisions, defending his policies and saying \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something\".",
      "Experts answered some of the questions you sent us as the world tries to make sense of the turmoil and wonders how long it will continue.",
      "Read their answers below.",
      "How does a stock market index work?",
      "Simon Jack, the BBC's business editor, said the FTSE 100, which represents the 100 biggest companies publicly listed in the UK, were all \"put in a big bucket back in 1984\" and given a certain weighting in that bucket depending on how big those companies were.",
      "The stock market is a reflection of their total value over time. The bigger the company, the more weight it has in the index. For example, an AstraZeneca or an HSBC has more weight than others.",
      "It works the same in the US with the S&P500, which is made up of the 500 biggest companies, with an enormous concentration in some names like Apple, Nvidia and Amazon.",
      "The stock market tells you how the value of the shares in those companies has changed - with a focus on those biggest names.",
      "Generally speaking, it is an indication of what some of our biggest companies are worth, and when they go up or down, it tells you something about the sentiment of whether their profits are likely to rise or fall in the future.",
      "How does a market downturn affect pensions and daily life?",
      "Jack explains that what happens in stock markets is not necessarily the same thing that happens in the economy. They can be linked, but they are not exactly the same.",
      "Some people invest directly in shares - and this will definitely affect them. These are some big falls, some of the biggest we have seen in a couple days since pandemic panic gripped the markets back in 2020.",
      "The other way that people are exposed to these changes is through their pension funds. Pension fund investing is a long term game. Not all of your money will go into shares - some will go into government bonds, and the closer you get to retirement, the more weighting you will have in things like cash and government bonds, so the less this will affect you.",
      "There are two types of pensions: a defined benefit pension - where you get a promised percentage of your salary at retirement - and defined contribution - where your pension pots value will rise and fall with financial markets.",
      "Pensions are exposed right now, but pension investing is a long term game.",
      "The warning sign flashing here is not the value of your pension pot - it is what is going to happen to the economies in which we all live and work.",
      "A lot of people are saying the chance of recession in both the US, UK - and even globally - have gone up a notch, which has implications for things like jobs and wages.",
      "How popular are tariffs in the US?",
      "There is growing scepticism about tariffs among Americans, although views still fall along partisan lines.",
      "According to one poll released last week, slightly more than half of Republicans, 52%, think tariffs help the economy, but 58% of independents say they hurt the economy, as do 89% of Democrats.",
      "However, that survey was held before Trump's global tariffs came into effect and trillions of dollars was wiped off the value of the US stock market. We will find out in the coming days how the economic turmoil has changed public sentiment.",
      "One of the key factors in President Trump's 2024 election victory was that more voters trusted him to improve the US economy, and especially to tackle high prices.",
      "Yet most economists warn that tariffs could drive up prices for US consumers as almost all imported goods will face a tax.",
      "There could be inflation and we could also see an economic downturn, and potentially a recession.",
      "How much of this is about China?",
      "Some think that the whole exercise is about an economic proxy war with China and the entire game is about just trying to level that playing field a little bit, Jack said.",
      "But Trump is right in one regard, which is that American markets are much more open to foreign goods than a lot of foreign markets are open to US goods.",
      "The UK, for example, puts a 10% tariff on US imported cars, 14% on some kinds of beef, and 8% on other things. So there are barriers both ways.",
      "And while Trump says that other countries have been ripping off the US, it is American corporations that have reasonably pursued shareholder value by trying to put their production facilities in the strategically and economically best places.",
      "It is the head of American corporations who opened subsidiaries in Ireland, where there is a low tax rate, and put manufacturing in Vietnam or Cambodia. In a way this has been the sort of rational pursuit of maximum profit, a system which has made the US very rich indeed.",
      "China is getting very rich indeed as well, and it is certainly moving up the value chain.",

    "story": [
      "Blanca Castro puts on a builder's helmet before opening the door to her kitchen. Inside it, the ceiling has a large hole that is dripping water and it looks as if it could collapse at any moment.",
      "Because the kitchen is unusable, Blanca has to wash her dishes in the bathtub, and she has improvised a cooking area with a gas camping stove in a corner of her living room.",
      "Many of her fellow tenants in this apartment block near Madrid's Atocha railway station have similar problems. They say the company that owns the building has stopped responding to requests for basic maintenance in recent months, since informing them that it will not renew their rental contracts.",
      "\"The current rental bubble is encouraging a lot of big owners to do what they are doing here,\" says Blanca. \"Which is to get rid of the current tenants who have been here a long time, in order to have short-term tourist flats, or simply to hike up the rent.\"",
      "Blanca and her fellow tenants have vowed to stay in the building despite what they see as efforts to push them out by the owners, who were not available for comment for this article.",
      "The tenancy contracts last five years, during which time rent is fixed, but this area of central Madrid has seen housing costs soar in recent years.",
      "\"For another home like this [in this area], I'd have to pay double or more what I'm paying now,\" says Blanca. \"It's not viable.\"",
      "She and her neighbours are among millions of Spaniards who are suffering the consequences of a housing crisis caused by spiralling rental costs.",
      "While salaries have increased by around 20% over the past decade, the average rental in Spain has doubled during the same period. There has been an 11% increase over the last year alone, according to figures provided by property portal Idealista, and housing has become Spaniards' biggest worry.",
      "It's also generating anger, with Spaniards taking to the streets to demand action from the authorities to make housing more affordable. On Saturday, 5 April thousands of people protested in Madrid and dozens of other cities.",
      "A report by Spain's central bank found that nearly 40% of families who rent now spend more than 40% of their income on their accommodation.",
      "\"The current problem is a huge imbalance between supply and demand,\" says Juan Vill\u00e9n, of Idealista. \"Demand is very good, the economy is growing a lot, but supply is dwindling very fast.\"",
      "Mr Vill\u00e9n offers the example of Barcelona, where rental increases have become notorious. Whereas nine families were competing to rent each property in the city five years ago, that number has risen to 54. Rental costs during that time have increased by 60%, he adds.",
      "\"We need to build more properties,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"And on the rental side we need more people willing to rent their properties, or willing to buy properties, refurbish them and put them on the rental market.\"",

      "Spain looks to immigrants to drive economy",
      "M\u00e1laga tourism: 'People feel the city is collapsing'",
      "The central government has described the situation as \"a social emergency\" and agrees that a lack of supply is driving the crisis. Last year, the Housing Ministry estimated that the country needs between 600,000 and one million new homes over the next four years in order to meet demand.",
      "This need for more housing has been pushed up in part by the arrival of immigrants who have joined the workforce and are helping drive Spain's economic growth. The ministry also pointed to a lack of social housing, which at 3.4% of total supply, is among the lowest in Europe.",
      "In 2007, at the height of a property-ownership bubble, more than 600,000 homes were built in Spain. But high building costs, lack of available land and a shortage of manpower have all been factors in restricting construction in recent years, with just under 100,000 homes completed in 2024.",
      "The government has taken measures to incentivise construction, apportioning land for the building of affordable homes, while trying to ensure that public housing does not end up in the private market, which has been a problem in the past.",
      "But the Socialist prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, has also expressed a willingness to intervene in the market in order to bring rental prices under control.",
      "At a recent event to mark the opening of 218 low-rent flats in the southern city of Seville, he declared that Spaniards \"want us to act, they want the housing market to operate according to the law of reason, of social justice, not the law of the jungle; they want to ensure that vulture funds and speculators are not doing whatever they like\".",
      "The central government and a number of local administrations have identified short-term tourist accommodation as part of the problem. Last year, the Canary Islands, the Balearic Islands and several cities on the mainland saw protests by locals against surging tourist numbers, with their impact on rental costs the main complaint.",
      "Several city halls have responded by announcing plans to restrict the granting of tourist-flat permits, while Barcelona is going further, revoking the licences of all of the city's 10,000 or so registered short-term apartments by 2028.",
      "The S\u00e1nchez government has also pushed through parliament a housing law, which includes a cap on rentals in so-called \"high-tension\" areas where prices are climbing out of control. Political resistance has meant that the legislation is so far only being implemented in the northern regions of the Basque Country, Navarre and Catalonia, and its success is open to debate.",
      "The Socialist-led regional and central governments have pointed to a 3.7% drop in rental costs in \"high-tension\" areas of Catalonia since the cap's introduction there a year ago, with Barcelona seeing a decrease of 6.4%.",
      "However, critics warn that the rental cap has spooked owners and caused thousands of properties to be withdrawn from the market.",
      "\"On the supply side, the problem is that all measures taken by the local or national governments are going against landlords,\" says Mr Vill\u00e9n. \"Even people that were doing build-to-rent new properties have been selling their properties because they don't want to get into the rental market.\"",
      "Another initiative proposed by the central government which has stirred up debate is a tax of up to 100% on properties bought by non-residents from outside the EU, on the grounds that such homes are often barely inhabited. This is a measure that, if rolled out, would heavily affect British buyers.",
      "The conservative opposition has accused the government of being too heavy-handed with its approach. However, as public anger builds over this issue, there are many others who would like the country's leaders to act much more stridently.",
      "Gonzalo \u00c1lvarez, of the Sindicato de Inquilinas e Inquilinos, an organisation that campaigns for tenants' rights, agrees that a shortage of available homes is a problem, but insists that building more is not the answer.",
      "\"There is a lack of housing because homes are being hijacked - on the one hand tourist flats, and on the other hand all the empty flats belonging to vulture funds and the banks,\" he says. \"So there's no need to build more, it's not necessary. But the housing we have has been hijacked.\"",
      "His organisation wants the government to impose drastic mandatory reductions in rent on owners and is threatening to orchestrate a nationwide strike by tenants that would see participants refuse to pay their rent.",
      "\"The [central and local] governments are not setting any limits,\" says Mr \u00c1lvarez. \"So who is going to? We will have to do it.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 05 Apr 2025 03:55:00 GMT",
    "summary": "What impact will the introduction of hefty tariffs on countries in Asia have on Nike's iconic US trainer?",
    "story": [
      "The Nike Air Jordan 1 is, in some ways, the iconic US trainer. It's a popular line by a large American brand, created four decades ago for homegrown basketball legend Michael Jordan.",
      "But although Nike sells most of its products in the US, almost all of its trainers are made in Asia \u2013 a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs salvo against foreign countries he accuses of \"ripping off\" Americans.",
      "Nike's shares fell 14% the day after the tariffs announcement, on fears over the impact they could have on the company's supply chain.",
      "Follow live updates",
      "So what will all this mean for the price of Nike's trainer?",
      "It depends on how much of the cost increase Nike decides to pass on to customers, if any, and how long they think the tariffs will actually be in place for.",
      "'Competitive industry'",
      "Goods from Vietnam, Indonesia and China face some of the heaviest US import taxes - between 32% to 54%.",
      "Hopes remain that Trump might be willing to negotiate those rates lower. On Friday, he said he had had a \"very productive\" call with the leader of Vietnam, helping Nike shares to recover some ground after their steep Thursday falls.",
      "But most analysts think the firm's prices will have to go up.",
      "Swiss bank UBS estimates that there will be a 10% to 12% increase in the prices of goods that come from Vietnam - where Nike produces half of its shoes.",
      "Meanwhile, Indonesia and China account for almost all of the balance of its trainer production.",
      "\"Our view is that, given how extensive the list of tariffs is, the industry will realise there are few ways to mitigate the impact in the medium term other than by raising prices,\" UBS analyst Jay Sole said in a note.",
      "David Swartz, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, agrees that price rises are likely but says any large price increase would reduce demand.",
      "\"This is a very competitive industry. My guess is that it would be difficult for Nike to raise prices by much more than 10-15%. I don't think it could offset most of the tariff,\" he says.",
      "Many other western brands such as H&M, Adidas, Gap and Lululemon will be facing the same predicament.",
      "Nike is already facing a tight bottom line.",
      "It had around $51bn (\u00a339.6bn) in sales in its most recent fiscal year. The cost of making products, including shipping, third-party profits and warehouse fees, consumed only about 55% of revenue, giving it a healthy gross profit margin of more than 40%.",
      "But that profit gets whittled away once you add in the cost of other business operations. A third of its revenue, for example, is consumed by selling and administrative expense.",
      "By the time you factor in interest and taxes, Nike's profit margin has shrunk to about 11%.",
      "That is across all its products, as they don't break down costs separately for its different items.",
      "Rahul Cee, who set up the trainer review website Sole Review, says there are other ways Nike could keep retail prices low.",
      "Mr Cee, who trained as a footwear designer and worked for Nike and Vans in India, says one way could be to downgrade the level of tech in the trainer.",
      "\"So instead of using high-performance midsole foams and construction, stick to injection moulded EVA (ethylene-vinyl acetate),\" he says.",
      "Another option would be instead of bringing out a new design every one to two years, to refresh the design cycle every three to four years.",
      "Things could change fast",
      "Simeon Siegel, managing director at BMO Capital Markets, says most companies were looking at Wednesday's announcement as \"still far from the final conclusion\".",
      "\"I don't think that many people believe that those numbers are etched in stone just yet,\" he says.",
      "Theoretically, Nike is such a big brand that it should be able to put up prices without it hitting their sales, he says, but adds: \"Do they have it right now is the question and do they have it across their product offering is another?\"",
      "Even before the announcement, Nike was facing a slump in sales that had curbed its ability to command full price for its shoes.",
      "Finance chief Matthew Friend has also cited tariffs as an example of developments that were affecting consumer confidence.",
      "And Nike relies heavily on US sales, with the market contributing to roughly $21.5bn of its sales - almost everything it sells in its largest market of North America.",
      "Sentiment in the US is a \"significant concern\" for Nike as it directly affects demand for its footwear, says Sheng Lu, a professor of fashion and apparel studies at the University of Delaware.",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",

      "Nintendo pulls Switch 2 pre-orders in US over Trump tariffs",
      "But ultimately he says firms may be forced to pass the cost of the levies on to consumers.",
      "\"Nike is very likely to raise prices if the tariff war persists. There is no way for brands to absorb a 30% to 50% increase in sourcing costs.\"",
      "He adds: \"How US trading partners react against the reciprocal tariff policy will also have a major impact.\"",
      "China has already hit back with a 34% tariff of its own.",
      "Part of the rationale behind Trump's tariff policy is because he wants more companies to manufacture their goods in the US.",
      "However, Prof Lu does not see Nike, or other companies, significantly reshaping its supply chain any time soon \"due to the complexity involved in footwear manufacturing\".",
      "That includes the time needed to \"consider a long list of factors when deciding where to source their products - quality, costs, speed to market and various social and environmental compliance risks\".",
      "Matt Powers from the Powers Advisory Group says the lack of American textile mills will make it \"difficult and expensive [for Nike] to pivot production back to the US\".",

    "summary": "What made the US step back from the system that it profited handsomely from for decades?",
    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump has built another wall, and he thinks everyone else is going to pay for it. But his decision to impose sweeping tariffs of at least 10% on almost every product that enters the US is essentially a wall designed to keep work and jobs within it, rather than immigrants out.",
      "The height of this wall needs to be put in historical context. It takes the US back a century in terms of protectionism. It catapults the US way above the G7 and G20 nations into levels of customs revenue, associated with Senegal, Mongolia and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "What occurred this week was not just the US starting a global trade war, or sparking a rout in stock markets. It was the world's hyper power firmly turning its back on the globalisation process it had championed, and from which it handsomely profited in recent decades.",
      "And in so doing, using the equation that underpinned his grand tariff reveal on the Rose Garden's lawns, the White House also turned its back on some fundamentals of both conventional economics and diplomacy.",
      "The great free trade debate",
      "Trump talked a lot about 1913 in his announcement. This was a turning point when the US both created federal income tax and significantly lowered its tariffs.",
      "Before this point, from its inception, the US government was funded mainly by tariffs, and was unapologetically protectionist, based on the strategy of its first Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton.",
      "The basic lesson the White House has taken from this is that high tariffs made America, made it \"great\" the first time, and also meant that there was no need for a federal income tax.",
      "On this side of the Atlantic, underpinning globalisation and free trade are the theories of 19th-Century British economist David Ricardo. In particular, the 1817 Theory of Comparative Advantage.",
      "There are equations, but the basics are pretty easy to understand: Individual countries are good at making different things, based on their own natural resources and the ingenuity of their populations.",
      "Broadly speaking, the whole world, and the countries within it, are better off, if everyone specialises in what they are best at, and then trades freely.",
      "Here in Britain this remains a cornerstone of the junction between politics and economics. Most of the world still believes in comparative advantage. It is the intellectual core of globalisation.",
      "But the US was never a full convert at the time. The underlying reluctance of the US never disappeared. And this week's manifestation of that was the imaginative equation created by the US Trade Representative to generate the numbers on Trump's big board.",
      "The rationale behind 'reciprocal' tariffs",
      "It is worth unpacking the rationale for these so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs. The numbers bear little resemblance to the published tariff rates in those countries.",
      "The White House said adjustments had been made to account for red tape and currency manipulation. A closer look at the, at-first, complicated looking equation revealed it was simply a measure of the size of that country's goods trade surplus with the US. They took the size of the trade deficit and divided it by the imports.",
      "In the hour before the press conference a senior White House official explained it quite openly. \"These tariffs are customised to each country, calculated by the Council of Economic Advisers\u2026 The model they use is based on the concept the trade deficit that we have is the sum of all the unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"",
      "This is really important. According to the White House, the act of selling more goods to the US than the US sells to you, is by definition \"cheating\" and is deserving of a tariff that is calculated to correct that imbalance.",
      "This is why the surreal stories about the US tariffing rarely visited islands only inhabited by penguins matter. It reveals the actual method.",
      "The long-term aim, and the target of the policy, is to get the US $1.2 trillion trade deficit and the largest country deficits within that down to zero. The equation was simplistically designed to target those countries with surpluses, not those with recognisable quantifiable trade barriers. It targeted poor countries, emerging economies and tiny irrelevant islets based on that data.",
      "While these two different factors overlap, they are not the same thing.",
      "There are many reasons why some countries have surpluses, and some have deficits. There is no inherent reason why these numbers should be zero. Different countries are better at making different products, and have different natural and human resources. This is the very basis of trade.",
      "The US appears no longer to believe in this. Indeed if the same argument was applied solely to trade in services, the US has a $280bn (\u00a3216bn) surplus in areas such as financial services and social media tech.",
      "Yet services trade was excluded from all the White House calculations.",
      "'China shock' and the ripple effect",
      "There is something bigger here. As the US Vice President JD Vance said in a speech last month, globalisation has failed in the eyes of this administration because the idea was that \"rich countries would move further up the value chain, while the poor countries made the simpler things\".",
      "That has not panned out, especially in the case of China, so the US is moving decisively away from this world.",
      "For the US, it is not David Ricardo who matters, it is David Autor, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) economist and the coiner of the term \"China shock\".",
      "In 2001, as the world was distracted by the aftermath of 9/11, China joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO), having relatively free access to US markets, and so transforming the global economy.",
      "Living standards, growth, profits and stock markets boomed in the US as China's workforce migrated from the rural fields to the coastal factories to produce exports more cheaply for US consumers. It was a classic example of the functioning of \"comparative advantage\". China generated trillions of dollars, much of which was reinvested in the US, in the form of its government bonds, helping keep interest rates down.",
      "Everyone was a winner. Well, not quite. Essentially US consumers en masse got richer with cheaper goods, but the quid pro quo was a profound loss of manufacturing to East Asia.",
      "Autor's calculation was that by 2011, this \"China shock\" saw the loss of one million US manufacturing jobs, and 2.4 million jobs overall. These hits were geographically concentrated in the Rust Belt and the south.",
      "The trade shock impact on lost jobs and wages was remarkably persistent.",
      "Autor further updated his analysis last year and found that while the Trump administration's first term dabble with tariff protection had little net economic impact, it did loosen Democrat support in affected areas, and boosted support for Trump in the 2020 presidential election.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",
      "The influencers who want the world to have more babies - and say the White House is on their side",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Fast forward to this week, and the array of union car workers and oil and gas workers celebrating the tariffs in the White House.",
      "So the promise is that these jobs will return, not just to the Rust Belt, but across the US. This is indeed likely to some degree. The president's clear message to foreign companies is to avoid the tariffs by moving your factories. The carrots offered by Biden followed by the stick from Trump could well lead to material progress on this.",
      "But the president's characterisation of the past half century of freer trade as having \"raped and pillaged\" the US obviously doesn't reflect the overall picture, even if it has not worked for specific regions, sectors or demographics.",
      "The US service sector thrived, dominating the world from Wall Street and Silicon Valley. US consumer brands used hyper-efficient supply chains stretching into China and East Asia to make incredible profits selling their aspirational American products everywhere.",
      "The US economy did very well indeed. The problem, simply, was that it was not evenly distributed among sectors. And what the US lacked was levels of redistribution and adaptation to spread that wealth across the country. This reflects America's political choices.",
      "The first social media trade war",
      "Now, as the US chooses to reshore its manufacturing with a sudden jolt of protectionism, other countries also have choices as to whether to support the flows of capital and trade that have made the US rich.",
      "The world's consumers have choices.",
      "It is little wonder major blue chip American companies, which have built cash machines on hyper-efficient East Asian supply chains producing cheaply and then selling to the whole world based on their attractive aspirational brands, have a big problem.",
      "Their share prices are particularly badly affected because the president has both decimated their supply chain strategies, and also risks greatly impairing their brand image amongst global consumers.",
      "Ultimately, this is the first social media trade war. The experience of Tesla's sale slump and Canada's backlash against US goods may prove contagious. That would be as powerful as any counter-tariff.",
      "These countries that bet on being the workshops for US consumers have choices over trade too. New alliances will form and intensify that seek to cut out an erratic US.",
      "The president's sensitivity to this was apparent when he threatened to increase tariffs if the EU and Canada joined forces over retaliation. This would be the nightmare scenario.",
      "In the game theory of trade wars, credibility does matter. The US has unrivalled military and technological might, which helps. But to transform the global trading system using an arbitrary formula, that throws up transparent absurdities, even without the penguins, is likely to encourage the other side to resist.",
      "This is especially the case when the rest of the world thinks that the loaded gun that the president is holding is being aimed at his own foot. The stock market fell most in the US. Inflation will go up most in the US. It is Wall Street now calculating a more-than-evens chance of a recession in the US.",
      "Perhaps there is some substance to the theory that the real objective here is to weaken the dollar and lower US borrowing costs.",
      "For now, the US is checking out of the global trade system it created. It can continue without it. But the transition is going to be very messy indeed.",

    "story": [
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.",
      "Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.",
      "\"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history,\" a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations \u2013 including the UK \u2013 for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.",
      "So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?",
      "Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?",
      "China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down",
      "The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.",
      "Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.",
      "Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies (\"space to talk about it\", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules (\"not happening\", says a government source).",
      "But as the US government prepared for its announcements on Wednesday, talks about a deal ground to a halt. Now, after the announcement, the \"ball is in their court\", said one government source involved, waiting to hear if, in the chaos of Trump's new tariff world, the White House can find time and energy to push a deal with the UK.",
      "\"We're expecting to hear from them any moment,\" one of those involved hopes. The risk, in the visible turmoil, is that any economic agreement could become a case of: don't call us, we'll call you. We'll be asking Darren Jones, the Treasury Minister, about it when he join us in the studio tomorrow.",
      "If a deal is done, however, do not expect an all-singing all-dancing arrangement. Instead, \"it would be a basic agreement on principles \u2013 rather than a super detailed trade agreement\", says a government source, contrasting these \"quick and dirty\" moves to long-running negotiations with India (\"we're on our 15th chapter with them!\").",
      "Uncertainty around the talks, and the limited nature of what a deal could achieve in any case, means No 10 is \"not sitting here waiting for it \u2013 it's not the basket where all our eggs are\".",
      "For weeks the government told us they were preparing for all kinds of scenarios. A secret cabinet committee was considering how the UK might react if Trump's tariffs materialised.",
      "But now they are here, the actual response is\u2026 not to respond, and to spend four weeks asking businesses if they would like the government to respond later on. That is not just Whitehall dither: at this stage, there seems to be almost zero appetite among ministers to join in with the rounds of tariffs between the US, China, and perhaps the EU in coming days.",
      "One Whitehall figure working with business says \"there has not been a single voice in business, big or small, saying this is the wrong strategy\".",
      "Ministers' approach to get businesses on board, like when Sir Keir invited dozens of big wigs to No 10 the morning after Trump's tariff announcement, is in part because of the anger when the government increased National Insurance contributions. \"The really calm reaction,\" one source says, \"is because we got people into the headspace where tariffs were going to happen \u2013 one of the businesses said they were being borderline stalked, we've been trying to persuade business to trust the process.\"",
      "The government is in no rush, and has no enthusiasm to introduce its own new tariffs, and for now at least, demands on them to do so are muted. According to a minister: \"Most people have considerable numbers of jobs in their constituencies on the line \u2013 even in cabinet there might have been some question marks but there weren't this week.\"",
      "And they joke that the Lib Dems, who are calling for tariffs in retaliation, \"keep demanding a trade war but I don't think they'll lead the nation\". Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who also does not want extra tariffs, will be on tomorrow's show too.",
      "But just as the government is going slow on hitting back, they are cracking heads to crack on with their existing plans faster.",
      "This isn't all about Trump. I understand the chancellor is looking at whether any of the money announced in the government's vital Spending Review can be brought forward from June. If government departments are able to finalise their deals, can that be sorted and made public as soon as possible?",
      "There are discussions too about whether it's possible to speed up the long waited-for Industrial Strategy \u2013 a plan to get investment into the UK pencilled in for June, but could it be brought forward? A decision hasn't been made but the prime minister is again, his team indicate, trying to use the jeopardy around the world as an impetus to push the government machine harder. \"We have to run quickly towards this,\" a government source says \u2013 and the chancellor is looking at it this weekend.",
      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "You might feel, haven't I heard this before? You'd be right. Since the start of the year, the prime minister and the chancellor have both repeatedly said the government has to go faster, work harder. So why after years in opposition weren't Starmer's team ready to go with all of these changes when they got into office? For a government that promised to be radical, its plans have not always been forthcoming.",
      "You may not fancy the kind of radicalism we're seeing out of the White House, but radical it certainly is. To compete, the UK may need to be that too.",
      "It is ludicrous to imagine the PM is \"very happy\" that the UK has been hit with tariffs as Trump suggested \u2013 \"artistic licence\", a government source remarked. No British action can completely insulate our economy from disruption abroad. But the government's own actions do matter, and this could be a defining moment.",
      "While there's been no lack of trying to soften the blows for the UK, the government's hopes have been dashed already. First, ministers believed the UK could escape tariffs, then they said they were prepared in case, then disappointed when they arrived.",
      "As Sir Keir spends another weekend on the phone, and his officials wait for their phone to ring, the government doesn't know what it will be able to say next.",
      "Marine Le Pen's ban outraged France's far right - and they may well take revenge",

      "That is an average of about 75 \"significant events\" reported to Ofsted each week - including incidents of serious injury or significant harm. There have even been rare cases involving deaths.",
      "The latest figures for serious incidents in the year 2023-24 are 40% higher than five years previously.",
      "Ofsted - which inspects England's education providers - says the rise may, in part, be due to its increased efforts to ensure nurseries report such events.",
      "Industry body, the Early Years Alliance, says most providers prioritise safety and that safeguarding breaches are extremely rare.",
      "Ms Wheeler and Mr Meehan are now calling for more frequent Ofsted inspections and for CCTV footage to be checked by inspectors.",

      "\"I completely lost who I was, that night in hospital, holding her.\"",
      "Nurseries made more than 4,200 reports of serious childcare incidents in 2023-24, the BBC has found, compared with 3,021 in 2019-20 - according to Ofsted figures, obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",
      "Ofsted - which regulates more than 27,000 non-domestic childcare settings in England - says these were reports it had assessed as urgent.",
      "Incidents could range from injuries or illnesses, to serious accidents and deaths. They also include events affecting nursery premises, such as fires or floods.",
      "Ofsted's broad criteria for reporting can mean nursery workers \"err on the side of caution\", the Early Years Alliance says - meaning investigations often find no safeguarding breach has, in fact, occurred.",

      "Schools rated good or outstanding are usually inspected every four years - and more frequently if graded lower.",
      "More than 1,500 nursery inspections had been brought forward after receiving reports of serious childcare incidents - Ofsted told us.",

      "Until 2015, inspectors would arrive at nurseries unannounced - but only a third of inspections are now carried out this way. Most nurseries are informed the day before.",
      "The notice period is used by some nurseries to deliberately mislead inspectors, some nursery workers told us. Managers ask friends or family to attend, they say, to make a nursery appear fully staffed.",
      "One former worker said 15 babies had been left sleeping in a room with only a baby monitor and no staff members to look after them. But when Ofsted announced an inspection, managers called in staff from other locations.",
      "The ex-Ofsted inspector says she witnessed workers man-handling children during inspections. \"If you can do that in front of someone, what are you planning on doing if nobody is watching?\" she adds.",

      "There were like-for-like figures from 36 councils for both that period and the five years up to 2015, when Ofsted stopped routine no-notice inspections.",
      "Reports of harm to young children almost tripled over that time - from 1,303 between 2010-15, to 3,342 between 2019-24. These figures may include cases where the incident was either accidental or unproven.",
      "Standards of care are low and if something does not change there will be \"more accidents, more harm to babies, more unhappy parents and children,\" says early childhood professor Helen Penn.",
      "Ofsted says it is giving \"conspicuous care and monitoring\" to reports of harm to children.",
      "More frequent inspections may be a solution, says Ofsted's Yvette Stanley, but she says the regulator does not currently have the resources available to do this.",
      "\"We think we do enough no-notice inspections to reassure ourselves in the cases where the data is worrying,\" she adds.",

    "story": [
      "A share of the revenue streaming services make from subscription fees should be paid into a fund to support British high-end TV production, an influential group of MPs has said.",
      "In a new report, the Culture, Media and Sport (CMS) committee urged the government to improve support measures for producers while safeguarding the creation of distinctly British content.",
      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",
      "Adolescence, created by Jack Thorne and Stephen Graham, tells the story of a 13-year-old boy who is charged with killing a female classmate.",
      "This week, it became fourth most popular English-language series in Netflix's history with 114 million views.",
      "A Netflix spokeswoman said: \"The UK is Netflix's biggest production hub outside of North America - and we want it to stay that way.",
      "\"But in an increasingly competitive global market, it's key to create a business environment that incentivises rather than penalises investment, risk taking and success. Levies diminish competitiveness and penalise audiences who ultimately bear the increased costs.\"",
      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",
      "The calls for greater help come after Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky told the BBC last month that the industry was in crisis, and that public service broadcasters including the BBC and ITV could no longer afford to make high-end British drama.",
      "A spokeswoman for the Department of Culture Media and Sport (DCMS) said: \"We acknowledge the challenges facing our brilliant film and TV industry and are working with it through our industrial strategy to consider what more needs to be done to unlock growth and develop the skills pipeline.",
      "\"We thank the committee for its report which we will respond to in due course.\"",
      "'Support freelancers'",
      "The report also noted while the introduction of tax breaks for independent British films, and for film and TV studios in England may have helped, it was not a \"silver bullet\" for solving many of the issues facing British producers.",
      "As well as providing greater support and resources for UK TV production workforces, the report also suggested that lawmakers should consider cutting VAT on cinema tickets as well as doing more to meet the challenges posed by AI.",
      "Paul W Fleming, general secretary of Equity, which represents British performers, said the government should \"heed the call\" for the licensing of creative works in all cases where they are used to train artificial intelligence models.",
      "\"AI is being built illegally by stealing Equity members' life's works,\" he said.",
      "Big tech firms \"must be held to account\", he added, \"brought to the table and made to pay creators what they owe.\"",
      "The cross-party committee recommended the government and British Film Institute (BFI) should launch a national awareness campaign, highlighting the employment opportunities offered by film and high-end TV, and \"the range of skills the industry requires\".",
      "It stressed how the industry \"benefits hugely from the flexibility afforded by a predominantly freelance workforce\" and therefore more should be done to \"support freelancers when they are out of work\"; such as the introduction of a minimum hourly wage or guaranteed basic income.",
      "Head of industry union Bectu, Philippa Childs, said: \"We welcome this timely and incisive report from the committee which identifies many of the urgent challenges currently facing the industry and its workforce.\"",
      "She added: \"It's essential that the industry does not become too skewed towards large streamers, which risks the homogenisation of content and the loss of much of the UK's unique and distinctive output.\"",

      "Notably, a Harry Potter-themed area will not be part of the park, as it is situated just a 40-minute drive from the Warner Bros Studio Tour in Leavesden, Hertfordshire.",
      "The source told the BBC that \"watertight exclusivity contracts\" made it difficult to include Hogwarts in the plans, although it could be reconsidered alongside other brands such as Nintendo or Wicked if the park were to expand in the future.",
      "\"Warner Bros has the UK rights to Harry Potter attractions. They tried to find a way round it but couldn't. That could change in years to come, though,\" the source said.",

      "Universal Destinations and Experiences is expecting 8.5 million visitors a year at the park.",

And I really don't think we'll lose that, or I hope not.",

      "\"I can totally see the value of AI as a tool for creative people. The point at which it worries me is if you remove the people bit from that equation, or you're just hoovering up their work and regurgitating it, and they're not being paid.\"",
      "Brooker also returns to another favourite tech theme, which he's used as a jumping off point for several Black Mirror episodes over the previous six series. The world of gaming.",
      "Remember the interactive standalone Black Mirror film Bandersnatch, where Asim Chaudhry and Will Poulter played a games company boss and a genius developer? The pair are now reprising their roles from the 2018 movie in a new series seven episode called Plaything.",

      "The Grade II*-listed statue was damaged in 2022 and 2023, when it was attacked by a member of the public with a hammer.",
      "Gill was among the most prominent sculptors of the 20th Century. But after his death in 1940, his diaries revealed he had sexually abused his daughters.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said on Wednesday the corporation \"in no way condones Gill's abusive behaviour\" but that it \"draws a line between the actions of Gill, and the status of these artworks\".",
      "There have been calls in recent years for Gill's 1930s work - which depicts Prospero and Ariel from William Shakespeare's play The Tempest - to be removed from the BBC's Broadcasting House.",

      "The BBC said the estimated total costs of the restoration and protective work was \u00a3529,715. It's understood the cost has been covered by the BBC rather than claimed on insurance.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said: \"When the building was subject to serious criminal damage, on two occasions, there were no easy options for addressing the destruction caused.",
      "\"Having sought expert advice and opinion, we repaired the fa\u00e7ade in line with the building's Grade II* status.\"",
      "She noted that working with Historic England and Westminster City Council, they had also installed a protective screen in front of the sculpture \"to avoid future damage\".",
      "Historic England CEO Duncan Wilson said: \"We recognise that since details of Gill's abusive behaviours came to light in the late 1980s, he has understandably become a controversial character.",
      "\"We welcome the BBC's approach to repairing the sculpture and providing interpretation which explores this complex history.",
      "\"This is in line with our approach of encouraging thoughtful, long-lasting and powerful (re)interpretation of contested statues and sites which keeps their physical context but adds new layers of meaning and understanding.\"",

      "Universal estimated the 476-acre complex could attract 8.5 million visitors in its first year.",
      "Sir Keir Starmer said the multibillion-pound investment by the company would \"see Bedford home to one of the biggest entertainment parks in Europe, firmly putting the county on the global stage\".",
      "The prime minister joked that his children, aged 14 and 16, were uncharacteristically interested in the news.",
      "\"They don't take that much interest in the announcements I'm making every day, I have to admit, but this one has really caught their eye,\" said Starmer, speaking on a visit to Kimberley College in nearby Stewartby.",

      "A full planning proposal will be submitted to the UK government, with construction expected to start in 2026.",
      "Universal had previously given its name to the PortAventura resort in Spain, but it is understood the UK attraction will be the first in Europe it has designed and built from scratch.",

      "Universal has already bought 476 acres for the project, but could buy more land to increase the plot to about 700 acres - which would improve transport links.",
      "Residents living in surrounding villages have responded positively to the plans, though some are concerned infrastructure will not be enough to support the amount of expected visitors.",

    "story": [
      "It doesn't take long to make David Hockney laugh.",
      "At nearly 88 years old, he is frail but still very dapper in his beige, red and black houndstooth suit with a white silk handkerchief poking out of the pocket, and trademark round yellow glasses perched on his nose.",
      "Britain's most popular artist chuckles a lot, his throaty laugh betraying his many years of smoking.",
      "But, he tells me, as a young student from Bradford at the Royal College of Art in London in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the other students laughed at him.",
      "\"People would mock my accent,\" he says. But it didn't faze him. Hockney knew his worth even then. \"I'd look at their artworks and I'd think, well, if I drew like that, I'd keep my mouth shut.\"",
      "What would the young boy growing up in Bradford think about the life he'd go on to have and the work he'd create?",
      "\"He'd have thought it was pretty daft.\"",
      "For decades, Hockney has been among the world's greatest living artists, and he is now opening his biggest ever show.",
      "As we sit together in a vast gallery at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a stunning museum designed in reflective glass on the edge of the Bois de Boulogne in Paris, I ask him what he thinks of the exhibition.",
      "He says it's his best ever, and bursts into laughter again.",
      "It's an expression of pure delight at the 11 rooms filled across four floors with his art - and at being alive to see it. \"I'm just laughing, I mean we made it!\"",
      "Two years ago, when they started planning the exhibition, \"I just thought I probably wouldn't be here\", he says. \"I'm still a smoker, a happy smoker fed up of bossy people telling you what to do... but I didn't know.\"",
      "Hockney is sporting a badge that says \"End Bossiness Soon\" in a gallery dedicated to his love of spring. During the pandemic in 2020, Hockney, who was living in Normandy, used his iPad to paint the trees and flowers blooming as spring arrived.",
      "Those 220 iPad works adorn this gallery, floor to ceiling, the walls bursting with blossom and pure joy, made at a time when the world wasn't feeling very hopeful.",
      "Visitors to the show are greeted at the entrance by Hockney's message from that time: \"Do remember they can't cancel the spring.\"",
      "Hockney has been in poor health. He now has two full-time carers, who have accompanied him to Paris from London, where he now lives. Portraits of both, sitting in their dark blue nurses' uniforms, are the most recent works in the exhibition, made earlier this year.",
      "A self-portrait of Hockney, painting and smoking a cigarette (his two great loves) is also very new.",
      "He still paints for four to six hours every day, he tells me.",
      "He believes you can't judge a painter until their last work is done - but looking at his own work gathered together in Paris, \"I can see what I was always trying to do, really\".",
      "And he promises that \"anybody who has just a little visual sensibility will really enjoy this show\".",
      "His great-nephew Richard Hockney, who has regularly sat for him for 28 years, since he was four years old, including for this exhibition, tells me everyone was determined the artist would make it to Paris.",
      "The night before, Hockney got into a car with his dachshund Tess to be driven across the Channel. And on the morning before they left, they were playing him variations of the jazz classic April in Paris.",
      "Having arrived, \"he is glowing\", Richard says. \"I think this will keep him going for a long, long time, to be honest.\"",
      "And with spring unfolding in the French capital, it's entirely appropriate that the artist known for chronicling spring would open his exhibition, David Hockney 25, now.",
      "This is a man who would fly back from his home in Los Angeles when he heard the hawthorn had begun to blossom in his native Yorkshire, just so he could paint the dazzling spectacle.",
      "Some of his earliest works, including probably his most famous, A Bigger Splash, are also on show in Paris.",
      "That painting, capturing the moment of a swimmer diving into a Santa Monica pool, is on the wall next to Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), the south of France pool painting that broke records when it sold at auction in 2018 for \u00a370m.",
      "Next to those are Mr and Mrs Clark and Percy, another of Hockney's most recognisable works, which depicts his good friend Celia Birtwell and her husband Ossie Clark, with their white cat on his knee.  Seeing them brought together in one room is spectacular.",
      "But the show's main focus is the last 25 years because \"it's 2025\", he says. \"People think it's miserable, but in 1925 they'd had the First World War.\"",
      "It's a visual feast, full of the bright colours and optimism for which Hockney has become known.",
      "\"I've always had it. I've always thought it was an absurd world.\"",
      "A world to laugh at, to look at closely, as Hockney does, and to paint vibrantly.",
      "Some of the iPad paintings are huge. He's \"amazed they could be blown up so big\" when they were created on something so small.",
      "One room is almost pitch dark to show off paintings he did of the Moon, made possible by advances in iPad technology.",

In February, he was jailed for 15 and a half years for a horrifying catalogue of abuse against five victims, but the BBC is aware of two women whose charges were dropped before they could get to court.",

      "\"That's when everything started to go downhill,\" Lily said. \"He started to do stuff to me.\"",

      "It's that last rule ex-Liverpool winger Jordon Ibe, who's now up front for John Terry's 26ers side, grapples with the most, saying corners should be left \"as God intended\".",
      "In these games, if the ball goes behind off the opposition three times, a penalty is awarded to the attacking team.",
      "But while the shift from the Premier League takes some getting used to, Ibe tells BBC Newsbeat he's impressed with the new format which can \"100%\" bring sport and entertainment closer together.",

    "story": [
      "In This City Is Ours, Liverpool actor James Nelson-Joyce plays a leading gang member who is struggling to balance his criminal career and family life, against a backdrop of changing modern masculinity.",
      "So it's not hard to see why the new BBC drama has been dubbed by reviewers as the \"Scouse Sopranos\" - with reference to the acclaimed US mafia boss Tony and his equally conflicting set-up.",
      "Nelson-Joyce plays the notorious Michael Kavanagh, who works for drug lord and lifelong friend Ronnie Phelan, played by Sean Bean. And the plot focuses on the power struggle between Michael and Ronnie's son Jamie - played by Nelson-Joyce's real life football friend and fellow Scouser Jack McMullen - as to who will take over the business when the top dog retires to Spain, via the Wirral.",
      "Inconveniently though, Michael falls in love with Diana (Hannah Onslow). The couple are trying for a baby but due to his low sperm count need to try IVF to start a family.",
      "It's not an ideal environment for domestic bliss to blossom - or good for Michael's street cred - but it does provide the scene for the 36-year-old actor's \"most amazing\" TV experience to date.",
      "\"It's about Michael allowing himself to be vulnerable,\" Nelson-Joyce tells BBC News.",
      "\"Because a lot of men put up this brave wall where it's like, I can't be seen to be that person,\" he adds. \"It's took Diana to be that breath of fresh air in his life.\"",
      "He believes it is important to show on screen how \"we are allowed to change\".",
      "\"Because Michael's identity throughout has been as Ronnie's right-hand man, so he's always been the one you don't mess with.",
      "\"Whereas for the first time in his life, he's allowing himself to be who he wants to be; this loving partner who's reliable, who's safe and who doesn't lie to his partner.\"",
      "The rising star, who has been mentioned as potential future James Bond, previously appeared opposite Sheffield actor Bean in another Merseyside crime drama, Time.",
      "And he has featured alongside another Liverpudlian, Stephen Graham, in Time, Little Boy Blue, and the recent historical drama A Thousand Blows.",
      "He says his latest character's respect for his partner in crime, Ronnie, was a mirror of his real life working relationship with Bean, who he describes as \"a gift\" of a co-star and a \"kind human being\".",
      "Graham is \"so supportive\" of Nelson-Joyce's career too. The former's own headline-grabbing new show, Adolescence, also tackles toxic masculinity and its potentially deadly effects.",
      "This City is Ours' Bafta-winning director Saul Dibb (The Sixth Commandment) notes how Nelson-Joyce has played \"hard men\" roles before but has not been able to demonstrate \"all of the other qualities\" he possesses, until now.",
      "'Superb crime thriller'",
      "The Telegraph has awarded the show five stars, calling it a \"superb crime thriller of betrayals and shifting loyalties\". Critic Anita Singh noted that it \"doesn't quite live up to\" the Sopranos \"but it comes close\".",
      "In a four-star review, the Independent said Nelson-Joyce's \"conflicted gangster\" and the show's \"moral ambivalence\" elevated it \"above the average boilerplate crime drama\".",
      "The Guardian's Lucy Mangan awarded three stars, however, suggesting \"the fantastic performances don't do enough to lift this Scouse Sopranos.\"",
      "But the Sunday Times' Carol Midgley offered another four-star review, saying it \"is as much about family dynamics and the human condition as it is about gangsters and violence\".",
      "The show's creator and writer Stephen Butchard (The Last Kingdom) tells us he is \"happy\" with comparisons to the \"brilliant\" New Jersey-based crime show \"because that really is about a family\".",
      "\"We haven't got as many cured meats,\" he jokes, of Mr Soprano's favourite food.",
      "Another reference point was Shakespeare, he explains, to \"explore those huge human emotions of your ambition and greed and love and betrayal.\"",
      "\"Once greed and secrets take hold, the fabric of any society, including a family, begins to fray,\" he adds.",
      "Former engineer Butchard was keen to capture the \"vibrancy\" of his native Liverpool, which he describes as a \"really handsome\" and \"friendly\" modern world city.",
      "Beautiful vistas of the city's skyline and glamorous waterfront are juxtaposed with life on its streets (along with shots of the gang's dealings in sunny Marbella and Malaga).",
      "\"I didn't want to show a Liverpool that has been seen previously on the television,\" he says.",
      "\"Because this story could be told in any city around the world, but then it's only when you come to the characters that you can give them that Liverpool inflection, bite and hopefully humour, and reflect the mood of the city.\"",
      "He says he was was impressed with the \"wonderful\" Scouse accents perfected by the non-local members of the extended fictional crime family, including Onslow, Julie Graham and Laura Aikman, as well as Derry Girls star Saoirse-Monica Jackson.",
      "As for genuine Scouser Nelson-Joyce, just when he thought he was out, the producers may have pulled him back in for a second series.",
      "\"We want to do a season two\" says the star.",
      "\"It would be mad if there wasn't\" offers Dibb.",
      "Both underline the overwhemingly positive responses they've received, particularly from viewers with purple bins.",
      "\"Because they're the people who know if we've got all the details right,\" says the London director, adding that Liverpudlians would \"not hold back\" in saying so if not.",
      "He recounts how a train conductor told actor Michael Noble - who plays Michael's confidant/enforcer, Banksey - that they had \"done they city proud\".",
      "The reaction has been \"really lovely\" and \"a bit crazy\" adds Nelson-Joyce.",
      "\"It feels like the whole city loves it,\" he says. \"I think people really bought the relationship between me and Hannah and really wanted us to work.\"",

    "story": [
      "Five years on from Megxit, as the Duchess of Sussex builds her new lifestyle empire, her viewing figures are high but, in the UK at least, popularity levels are low. So, ahead of the release of her new podcast tomorrow, experts ask whether anything she does can win wider appeal?",
      "Listen to Daniela read this article",
      "\"The problem is that people are much more interested in the royal gossip than they are in learning how to make a jam.\" The Countess of Sandwich gets to the crux of what she sees as the Duchess of Sussex's rebrand dilemma.",
      "As an American woman who married into the British aristocracy back in 2004, the countess knows firsthand the challenge of slipping between two cultures.",
      "When I first spoke to her about this - long before \"Megxit\" - she was positive that Meghan would win over the nation. \"Having this American optimism and this go-get attitude, that is what you guys kind of like about us, right?\" she told me.",
      "Seven years on, the countess remains optimistic about Meghan's progress. \"As an American, I look at her and I think she's a hustler. She's taking these opportunities, using them as stepping stones to get to where she wants to go.\"",
      "Only not everyone appears to agree. In the UK, Meghan's popularity rating was just 19% at the start of 2025 according to a YouGov poll, down from 26% a year earlier. (In the US, the view is slightly more favourable, sitting at 43% in January 2025.)",
      "Her recent Netflix lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan, which featured her upcycling supermarket bouquets and scenting flannels with lavender water, wasn't received entirely warmly either.",
      "Despite it being the tenth most watched Netflix programme globally in its first week, audiences gave it a rating of just 33% on the film and television review website, Rotten Tomatoes (based on more than 2,500 votes).",
      "This was followed by the launch of her new brand As Ever, selling, among other things, \u00a311 ($14) edible flower petals and jars of \u00a321.50 ($28) wildflower honey. These sold out within a day, yet this too was met by criticism in some quarters \u2014 with prices being lambasted and some questioning whether Meghan had a clear vision for the brand.",
      "Now, she is set to host a new podcast, Confessions of a Female Founder, which launches tomorrow. In an Instagram post, she wrote with some excitement: \"I've been having candid conversations with amazing women who have turned dreams into realities.\" But the question now is how will this be received.",
      "And, as her era of brand builder, lifestyle influencer, and businesswoman steams on, what will it really take for her to broaden her popularity and win over those who are circumspect - or downright negative?",
      "Or could it be that no matter how successful her bottom line or however pioneering her next project, a wider issue is holding back the possibility of broader appeal - and if that really is the case, how to shrug that off?",
      "Five years on: Megxit's lingering impact",
      "It has been five years since the Duke and Duchess of Sussex walked out of Westminster Abbey, after the annual Commonwealth Service, and into a life away from royal duty.",
      "As the couple's grand finale in the UK, it made the optics around the service incredibly tense. Even the question of how the royal party should enter the Abbey became a sticking point.",
      "The printed order of service did not include Prince Harry and Meghan in the official royal arrival. The plan had been for them to take their seats earlier, and for Elizabeth II to lead a small procession of senior royals into the Abbey slightly later. However this decision upset the couple, according to those planning the service.",
      "It was eventually decided, in order to diffuse the situation, that the Prince of Wales and Catherine, Princess of Wales (back then, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) would not walk behind the Queen either. Instead, like Prince Harry and Meghan, they would take their seats earlier.",
      "Someone who attended the service that day described it to me as \"deeply uncomfortable\".",
      "The friction set the mood for the years ahead. And though Meghan has only made two visits to the UK since 9 March 2020, and her life is now firmly rooted in her home state of California, the impact continues, according to some experts.",
      "According to Evan Nierman, a US-based public relations guru: \"Whatever she does to distance herself, it comes back to Buckingham Palace and her relationship with the Royal Family.\"",
      "Mark Borkowski, founder of the UK-based Borkowski communications agency, also believes that whatever Meghan does next, it will always be filtered through \"the royal lens\". \"Even when Meghan is launching jam or Harry is speaking about mental health, the coverage returns to the same question: are they thriving or failing in their post-royal life?\"",
      "There have been questions around choices the couple have made since leaving the UK, too, particularly around the polarising interview with Oprah Winfrey in 2021, and through the publication of Prince Harry's memoir Spare in 2023.",
      "One source who has worked with them described this as \"brave and idiotic\".",
      "With that chapter behind them, it was natural that they would focus on new income streams that don't involve talking about the Royal Family. But as Mr Nierman, founder of Red Banyan Public Relations in the US, puts it: \"She's trying to stand out on her own, but she has this level of notoriety and fame that is inextricably linked to the Royal Family.\"",
      "Much of the response to Meghan, positive or negative, \"is driven by her marriage to Prince Harry and her ties to the Royal Family\", argues James Crawford, managing director of PR Agency One. \"That connection shapes how everything she does is received.\"",
      "'An unerring instinct for getting it wrong'",
      "Early indications are that though her public popularity may not be sky-high, this is not necessarily translating into lack of business success.",
      "Some critics, though, tell another story. Tina Brown, the former Vanity Fair editor, put her own review somewhat harshly, concluding that Meghan has an \"unerring instinct for getting it wrong\".",
      "On the Netflix series, which was released on 4 March, she added: \"Meghan has come out with a show about fake perfection just when the zeitgeist has turned raucously against it.\"",
      "Other criticism has also focused on a perceived lack of relatability, in a show that was designed to revolve around the duchess casually sharing hosting tips with friends.",
      "\"High on gloss, low on human connection,\" said British Vogue. \"Toe-curlingly unlovable TV,\" said The Guardian, while The Telegraph, somewhat cruelly, called the series an \"exercise in narcissism\".",
      "Royal author Sally Beddell Smith, meanwhile, feels that the approach itself was a misstep. \"What mystifies me is why not relaunch The Tig,\" she says, referring to the lifestyle website that Meghan once ran.",
      "\"It had brand loyalty and was easily identifiable. She did it well. It was snappy, it had a reason to exist. It could have really given her a leg up. Why not reignite it?\"",
      "And yet negative responses will not have surprised Prince Harry and Meghan, according to people who work with the couple. They were, I'm told, braced for criticism.",
      "And there were positive responses too, particularly outside the UK. \"Some international press praised the show's warm, feel-good tone and visual polish, seeing it as a natural return to Meghan's pre-royal lifestyle roots,\" points out Mr Crawford.",
      "\"Likewise, her brand has been well received in some quarters for its positioning and premium aesthetic.\"",
      "The benefits of the Marmite effect",
      "With Love, Meghan was far from a disaster in the ratings, with 2.6 million views in its first week. Though this was well behind the launch of a sci-fi drama, Halo: Season One, which had 4.2 million views in the same period, experts point out that such comparisons are perhaps unfair.",
      "\"I would never have predicted it to be right at the top of charts,\" argues Adam Miller, TV editor of Metro. \"A lifestyle show is never going to be at the top against a drama or a thriller... For Netflix, I reckon it's about as expected.\"",
      "What's more, With Love, Meghan was never going to change opinions of those who are already, for whatever reason, predisposed against her - just as her new podcast series is unlikely to.",
      "Existing Meghan fans will likely enjoy the programme. For those who don't like Meghan, the series is likely to irritate. And according to some experts, a Marmite effect is no bad thing.",
      "\"In today's polarised media landscape, divisiveness isn't always a disadvantage,\" argues PR guru Mr Crawford.",
      "The wider question is how to respond to it. And Meghan's recent approach has become more direct. After podcaster Amanda Hirsch posted a picture of the Netflix series trailer with the caption: \"You guys I'm scared for Meghan,\" the duchess allegedly responded with a handwritten note.",
      "\"Dear Amanda, I heard you are feeling scared,\" the note reads. \"Don't be. This is the fun part \u2014 let's enjoy it.\"",
      "Likewise, she responded with humour to rumours of a potential feud with actress and Goop founder Gwyneth Paltrow.",
      "In an Instagram video, Ms Paltrow remarked: \"I genuinely do not understand this at all, whatsoever.\" She then turned her head to ask someone off screen: \"Do you understand this?\" The actress revealed Meghan sitting beside her, who shrugged her shoulders nonchalantly, while eating a piece of pie.",
      "It was a marketing triumph - a sign that, while she's taking notice, she knows what is really needed. That is, a fresh approach - and that's what Meghan the businesswoman is all about.",
      "At home with the Sussexes",
      "Away from business, life for the couple in California is largely a private one. Their multi-million dollar home in Montecito, around two hours drive up the coast from Los Angeles, is secluded and well-guarded and they have kept their circle of loyal friends tight - among them, tennis star Serena Williams, as well as actress Abigail Spencer.",
      "Meghan has talked about bonding with parents of her children's friends too, describing nights out, Pilates classes and sharing children's parties.",
      "When the couple go out for dinner, however, they are mostly left to themselves. Chef Vikram Vij has a restaurant in Vancouver where he says the couple have dined on several occasions. \"Everybody knew they were there but they weren't disturbed,\" says Mr Vij.",
      "\"They were both aware and so respectful of every person that came in contact with them,\" he adds. \"They took the time to say hello to us as a kitchen [and] paid the whole bill for themselves and their security, which I thought was very respectful.\"",
      "Yet for every positive story comes a negative one \u2013 with contradictory claims of less positive experiences from those who have worked with and known the couple.",
      "\"The atmosphere around Harry and Meghan is so febrile,\" says Vanity Fair contributing editor, Anna Peele, who spent months working on a piece about the couple.",
      "More recently, a row around the running of Sentebale, the charity that Prince Harry co-founded in honour of his late mother, has escalated into a bitter dispute, which will now be investigated by the Charity Commission.",
      "Insiders and those who have worked at Sentebale have been robust in their defence of Prince Harry and Meghan, and critical of accusations.",
      "But though this is largely a story about Prince Harry and his charity work, there is a Meghan element to it too, suggesting she is still not able to disentangle herself and her brand from interest in the Royal Family.",
      "'A spare to his wife'?",
      "The question of where Meghan and Prince Harry go from here is up for debate. \"They keep trying new things,\" argues Ms Peele. \"Harry and Meghan have the best of intentions but intentions doesn't always mean impact.\"",
      "Mr Niemar, meanwhile, believes that the best way to address this is to shake off the past and keep doing what they are already doing.",
      "\"They got what they were after - global fame exposed what they felt they needed to do,\" he says. \"But you can only ride that train for so long\u2026 She's doing the right thing trying to carve out something new.\"",
      "However their next steps require careful consideration. For royal author Sally Bedell Smith, it's no longer just about where Meghan pivots next, but how Prince Harry fits into that. \"Do they scale back and live in a more modest way? Does Harry throw himself into the cause of helping veterans and do things in a quiet way and at a lower key?\"",
      "With a pause she adds: \"He's now a spare to his wife.\"",
      "And yet many royal watchers are optimistic that, despite some negative reviews of late, their path ahead will be a success. \"It's never too late to turn things around,\" says Katie Nicholl, journalist and author of The New Royals.",
      "\"But there's a sense that these two need to listen to their advisers, focus on the next five years and really have a concrete plan... Hollywood is a hard town to crack and they've proved that royal titles alone aren't enough to guarantee success.\"",
      "What that success could look like is a bigger question still. Some have mooted a return to acting for Meghan, who previously starred in the legal drama, Suits, though no one I spoke to recently felt this was realistic. (Although a cameo on the reboot of Suits, which will be set in Los Angeles, would cause a stir.)",
      "\"She's not the same person she was on Suits. She's not the American girl at the Palace,\" argues Ms Peele. \"She has evolved.\" So far, this involves being a business mogul, lifestyle entrepreneur and content creator.",
      "But Katie Nicholl believes that much of their potential now lies away from lifestyle programming and media deals.",
      "\"While they need to be commercially successful, I think much of their success depends on their philanthropy, on really developing their Archewell Foundation and using their global spotlight for good.",
      "\"That's where they really have impact and stand out.\"",

      "More than 30,000 people contracted HIV and hepatitis from contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 80s \u2013 and 3,000 people have since died.",
      "Victims groups have since said the government has been slow to pay out compensation and the process was lacking transparency. Inquiry chair Sir Brian Langstaff said he had decided to act given the \"gravity\" of the problems expressed.",
      "What is the infected blood scandal?",
      "The government said it was \"fully-committed\" to cooperating with the inquiry.",

      "When Sir Brian's final report was published last May, the then Conservative government responded immediately setting out a new compensation scheme.",
      "While some victims had received payments previously, the new compensation scheme increased the amount they could be paid and made compensation available to a much wider group of people, including to the family and loved-ones of those who were infected.",
      "A new organisation, the Infected Blood Compensation Authority, was set up to oversee the scheme with nearly \u00a312 billion set aside for payments.",

    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump says he will soon announce \"major\" tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals, a move that could end decades of low-cost global trade in medicines.",
      "For years, most countries, including the US, have imposed few or no tariffs on finished drugs, thanks in part to a 1995 World Trade Organisation (WTO) agreement aimed at keeping medicines affordable.",
      "This shift comes after Trump introduced a blanket 10% tariff on other imports last week, as part of a broader effort to bring manufacturing back to the US.",
      "His new \"reciprocal\" tariffs - including a duty of 104% on goods arriving from China - came into force on Wednesday, intensifying a global trade war and further shaking markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical buyers, so far spared from such measures, are now preparing for what may come next.",
      "The US has typically imported vast quantities of finished medicines from India, Europe and China without buyers paying tariffs - although active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs), used to make drugs, do face some duties.",
      "Speaking at a fundraiser dinner for his Republican Party on Tuesday, Trump said: \"We're going to be announcing very shortly a major tariff on pharmaceuticals. And when they hear that, they will leave China.\"",
      "He also told reporters on board his Air Force One plane last week that \"pharma\" tariffs would arrive \"at a level that you haven't really seen before\", saying these would be announced \"in the near future\".",
      "In 2024, the US imported $213bn (\u00a3168bn) worth of medicines - more than two and a half times the total a decade earlier.",
      "While short on detail, his comments have rattled buyers, especially those relying on Indian imports. India supplies nearly half of all US generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs, saving the country billions in healthcare costs.",

      "Indian pharma stocks fell sharply on the news. India sends about a third of its $13bn annual pharma exports to the US, which is a key market.",
      "At the moment, Americans pay little or no tax on imports of Indian medicines - compared with the duty of nearly 11% paid by Indians importing American medicines.",
      "Indian drugmakers warn that tariffs would force them to raise prices, which could ultimately drive up US medical bills. While firms like Cipla and Dr Reddy's have US plants, most say moving production is not viable for low-margin generic drugs.",
      "European drugmakers are also on alert. After a high-level meeting between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top pharma firms on Tuesday, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) warned that tariffs could shift production away from Europe, and to the US.",
      "The EFPIA, whose members include major pharmaceutical companies such as Bayer, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk - the maker of the star diabetes type 2 drug Ozempic - expressed concerns that rising tariffs could disrupt Europe's role as a key player in global pharmaceutical production.",
      "In 2024, pharmaceuticals were the EU's largest export to the US, worth a reported $127bn (\u00a3100bn).",
      "Major companies have urged the EU to act swiftly, seeking policy changes to enhance Europe's competitiveness and prevent a \"mass exodus\" to the US. They have also expressed concerns about potential EU retaliatory tariffs, which could disrupt supply chains and affect patients on both sides of the Atlantic.",

    "summary": "Grace Davidson gave birth to a baby girl two years after her sister's womb was transplanted into her body.",
    "story": [
      "A \"miracle\" baby girl has become the first child in the UK to be born to a mother using a donated womb.",
      "The baby's mum, Grace Davidson, 36, was born without a functioning uterus, and received her sister's womb in 2023 \u2013 in what was then the UK's only successful womb transplant.",
      "Two years after that pioneering operation, Grace gave birth to her first child in February. She and her husband, Angus, 37, have named their daughter Amy after Grace's sister, who donated her womb.",
      "Holding baby Amy - who weighed just over two kilos (four and a half pounds) - for the first time was \"incredible\" and \"surreal\", new mum Grace says.",
      "\"It was quite overwhelming because we'd never really let ourselves imagine what it would be like for her to be here,\" she says. \"It was really wonderful.\"",
      "Grace and Angus, who live in north London but are originally from Scotland, hope to have a second child using the transplanted womb.",
      "The couple initially wished to remain anonymous, but following the safe arrival of baby Amy are now speaking to the BBC about their \"little miracle\".",
      "The surgical team told the BBC they have carried out three further womb transplants using deceased donors since Grace's transplant. They aim to carry out a total of 15 as part of a clinical trial.",
      "Grace was born with a rare condition, Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, where the womb is missing or underdeveloped, but with functioning ovaries. When the BBC first spoke to her in 2018, she was hoping her mother could donate her uterus to allow her to have children - but it proved to be unsuitable.",
      "The BBC met Grace and husband Angus again in 2019 when one of Grace's two sisters, Amy Purdie, was being assessed to find out if she could donate her womb to Grace. Amy and her husband already had two children and did not want any more.",
      "Prior to surgery both sisters had counselling. Grace and Angus also had fertility treatment and still have several embryos in storage. Grace says she was given the option of surrogacy or adoption, but carrying her own baby felt \"really important\".",
      "\"I have always had a mothering instinct,\" she says, \"but for years I had been suppressing it because it was too painful to go there.\"",
      "Womb transplants: how do they work?",
      "The first baby born as a result of a womb transplant was in Sweden in 2014. Since then around 135 such transplants have been carried out in more than a dozen countries, including the US, China, France, Germany, India and Turkey. Around 65 babies have been born.",
      "Originally scheduled to take place in late 2019, the sisters' transplant operation fell through and then looked in doubt for several years during the Covid pandemic.",
      "When it eventually took place, in February 2023, it took a team of more than 30 medics around 17 hours to remove Amy's womb and transplant it to Grace.",
      "Isabel Quiroga, the surgeon who led the transplant team at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, says although the procedure carried risks for both sisters, it was \"life-enhancing and life-creating - and you can't have better than that.\"",
      "Amy says she did not feel the sense of loss some women experience after a hysterectomy, because of the \"dramatic\" and immediate benefits to her sister. Grace had her first ever period within two weeks of the transplant and became pregnant on the first attempt at IVF.",
      "It was \"incredible\" to feel her baby's first kick, she says, adding the entire pregnancy had been \"really special\".",
      "Baby Amy was born by Caesarean section at Queen Charlotte's hospital in west London on 27 February.",
      "\"It was an incredible moment, full of joy,\" says surgeon Isabel Quiroga.",
      "Grace and Angus say they hope to have a second child - as soon as the medical team say the time is right.",
      "The donated womb will be removed after the birth of a second child. This will allow Grace to stop taking the daily immunosuppressants she is currently on to ensure her body does not reject her sister's womb. Taking these drugs can increase the risks of developing some cancers, especially if taken over many years - but surgeon Isabel Quiroga says these risks should return to baseline once the womb is removed.",
      "Prof Richard Smith, a gynaecological surgeon at Imperial College Healthcare, who led the organ retrieval team, has been researching womb transplantation for more than two decades.",
      "He says his team is thrilled about the birth of baby Amy.",
      "\"I'm not often short of words but when the baby came out I was speechless - there were a lot of tears in the theatre that day.",
      "\"The whole thing is astonishing and incredibly moving,\" Prof Smith adds.",
      "He says Amy's birth will give hope to many of the 15,000 women in the UK of childbearing age who do not have a functioning uterus, of whom around 5,000 were born without a womb.",
      "Mr Smith heads a charity called Womb Transplant UK, which paid the NHS costs for Grace's transplant operation. All the medical staff gave their time for free.",
      "He told the BBC around 10 women have embryos in storage or are undergoing fertility treatment, a requirement for being considered for womb transplantation. Each transplant costs around \u00a330,000, he says, and the charity has sufficient funds to do two more.",
      "The surgical team has permission to perform 15 womb transplants as part of a clinical trial, five with living and 10 with deceased donors. No details have been made public about the three women who have so far received wombs from deceased donor organs. NHS Blood and Transplant told the BBC extra consent is sought from families for such rare donations.",
      "Baby Amy's father, Angus, says he and Grace will never be able to thank his wife's sister enough for enabling them to become parents. It was an \"absolute no brainer\" that they would name Amy after her aunt, Angus says.",
      "The baby's middle name is Isabel, after the surgeon who led the womb transplantation team.",
      "For Grace, having baby Amy has brought her even closer to her sister.",
      "\"It was incredibly difficult to let her do that for me,\" she says, \"it's a huge act of sisterly love.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 07 Apr 2025 23:04:10 GMT",
    "summary": "With public satisfaction in the NHS just 21%, one area has a plan to shake up its services that could reduce GP waiting lists, as well as unblock hospital beds - but can it really work nationwide?",
    "story": [
      "Listen to this article on BBC Sounds",
      "Ministers, health staff and the public gathered in London last week for a summit to discuss the 10-year NHS plan in England. It was the final roadshow in a nationwide tour to help set out the strategy the government says will rescue the \"broken\" NHS, which has a waiting list of nearly 7.5 million patients and public satisfaction of just 21% - a record low.",
      "Not for the first time, moving healthcare away from hospitals and into the community is being touted as a way of treating people better and for less. Research suggests that every \u00a3100 spent on community care would otherwise cost \u00a3131 for hospital care.",
      "This helps explain why Health Secretary Wes Streeting has promised to turn the NHS into a neighbourhood health service.",
      "Washwood Heath, a community health clinic that was set up in a deprived part of east Birmingham two years ago when the Conservative government was in power, is a living, working example of what this could look like. Here, hospital doctors, GPs, nurses, occupational therapists, council social care teams, mental health professionals and charity staff work under one roof.",
      "The three-storey building combines an urgent treatment centre offering some of the services usually provided by hospitals, as well as a diagnostic service (for MRI scans, X rays and ultrasounds), alongside mental health care and wider social support.",
      "In practice, this allows for addressing social problems such as housing issues, alongside treating physical health conditions, plus arranging support for daily tasks such as washing and dressing.",
      "The target is the most frequent users of health services - and the aim is to keep them well and out of hospital.",
      "\"We want to work with the 10% of the population that is responsible for 70 to 80% of its use,\" explains Richard Kirby, head of Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Trust, one of the key partners at Washwood Heath. \"The NHS cannot meet their needs on its own \u2013 it requires partnership working.\"",
      "Streeting himself is on board. Speaking to the BBC this week, he said that Washwood was a \"pioneering service\" and he is firm that the model could \"be the future of the NHS\".",
      "However not everyone is convinced. And while few argue against the principle of more care within the community, there are wider questions around just how feasible it is on a bigger scale.",
      "A model system to unblock beds?",
      "In the middle of the clinic, staff gather around five touchscreens, each containing up-to-date information about patients from east Birmingham who are in hospital or making calls to the ambulance service. Their goal is to get these patients discharged from hospital as swiftly as they can - and keep them out.",
      "One way of doing this is by arranging remote monitoring from the 'virtual wards team' (which allows doctors to keep an eye on patients who would otherwise have to stay on the wards), as well as ordering equipment such as mobility aids and medicine dispensers to be delivered to their homes.",
      "The team is also automatically alerted if a patient registered at the clinic calls for an ambulance or is admitted to hospital. There is a live link to the local Heartlands Hospital, where the clinic's own team of therapists and paramedics see patients face-to-face on the wards and liaise with hospital staff to try to get them home.",
      "\"Our job is to identify which patients will benefit from our help,\" says nurse Dani Fullerton. \"It's so different from anything I have done before.\"",
      "Tackling loneliness to save money",
      "One issue the neighbourhood teams are homing in on is loneliness - they have identified this as a way to keep down hospital numbers.",
      "Government commissioned research published in 2020 suggests the cost of severe loneliness to be more than \u00a39,500 for each person in that category, due to the combined impact on wellbeing, health, and work productivity.",
      "So, at the centre, local neighbourhood teams plan intense support for the most vulnerable residents, knitting together not just what the NHS and council provide, but what charities can offer too.",
      "\"We have patients going to GPs and A&E basically because they are lonely,\" says Christine Francis, who is employed as a 'social prescriber'. Her job is to help find new activities and groups for the lonely and then accompany them until they are settled.",
      "\"The NHS cannot solve [loneliness]. But I can link patients in with befriending services or, if they can get out and about, local groups such as knitting groups or organised walks.\"",
      "Ms Francis also works with groups who can help with house cleaning and tackle other issues associated with poor mental health, such as hoarding.",
      "At present some doubt there is enough robust evidence from the research to show the effectiveness of social prescribing. The neighbourhood team is adamant their approach is making a difference, however, based on what they've seen first-hand.",
      "Hamzisah Aslam, an occupational therapist at Birmingham Council, recalls visiting one patient with health and alcohol problems, whose home was littered with cardboard boxes and rubbish. The visit, also attended by a GP, mental health professional and social prescriber, lasted more than an hour.",
      "\"Afterwards, we had a five-minute debrief and drew up a plan and it was actioned the next day - you would never be able to do that if we were all working individually.\"",
      "Some GPs I spoke to have also observed a positive impact. Dr Subeena Suleman says the neighbourhood team worked with two patients from her practice who were frequent visitors because of their range of health and social issues. An estimated 100 appointments at the GP surgery were freed up over six months.",
      "\"It meant we had more time for other patients,\" says Dr Suleman. \"We even started offering longer appointments of up to 30 minutes for those that need it.\"",
      "In the first 12 months since Washwood Heath began operating, GP visits among the local population supported by the centre fell by 31%, A&E attendances by 20% and admissions to hospital by 21%.",
      "However, there is not yet robust evidence to quantify how much more efficient the new model would be if expanded across the city.",
      "The knock-on effect for hospitals",
      "The most recent addition to the centre is an emergency service for patients with respiratory illness that opened in December to address the fact that around 40% of admissions to the nearby Heartlands Hospital related to lung and breathing conditions.",
      "So far the service, which is staffed by UHB respiratory specialist nurses and doctors, has taken in 670 patients. Christopher Thomas is one of them. He used to be a builder and worked with asbestos. Now 77, he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which he believes has links to his job.",
      "Recently, he went to hospital after coughing up blood, and was told he had pneumonia - but rather than being kept in hospital, he was discharged into the care of Washwood clinic's respiratory service.",
      "This, he says, worked far better for him. \"I was able to stay at home to rest and take my medications and I can just ring the team at Washwood if I have any concerns.\"",
      "Respiratory medicine consultant Dr Rifat Rashid is also positive. \"Here we can see and test patients quickly \u2013 there are not the delays we have in hospital waiting for results.\"",
      "But there are broader benefits for the hospital too in her view - she says GPs are starting to refer their patients directly to Washwood Heath and ambulances are also now bringing patients to the centre rather than the hospital.",
      "Despite the benefits of fewer admissions, ultimately hospitals are no less full - while fewer people in the Washwood area are being admitted, patients from elsewhere have filled the beds.",
      "The model is being expanded across the city - the aim is to have a network of six community hubs and 25 to 30 integrated neighbourhood teams, covering Birmingham's population of 1.4 million people.",
      "Not every centre will be identical. For example, in the north of the city, there might be a focus on helping with frailty to support the older, more affluent population demographic.",
      "There are of course costs - these are estimated at less than \u00a3100,000 as the six hubs as the centres will use existing buildings and redeployed staff.",
      "Richard Kirby thinks the model could easily be replicated nationwide. \"We believe this is the right model,\" he insists.",
      "But there is a catch. As he puts it, \"It only works when the whole system buys into it.\"",
      "Tight budgets and a 'cynical' sector",
      "Part of the problem with making the whole system buy into it is money. Ruth Rankine, an NHS Confederation primary care director, believes that during times, such as now, when money is tight, collaboration generally becomes harder.",
      "\"People are too focused on their budgets and making sure it goes on where they immediately need it,\" she says.",
      "But clinics like Washwood Heath require collaboration and pooling resources.",
      "The other issue, she argues, is that the hospital sector has, in places, \"been a bit cynical\". \"The problem is that it takes time to get results \u2013 you need to invest in front and then it can be years before it has an impact.\"",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "'It's unforgivable': The problem at the heart of the NHS's maternity care failures",
      "Another concern is around finding suitable premises. In Birmingham, officials I spoke to acknowledged they were lucky to have a network of large health centres (as they were beneficiaries of a short-lived finance programme launched in the 2000s to improve community NHS buildings) but many other places around the country do not.",
      "This is a concern for Dr Richard Vautrey, a GP from Leeds who has been involved in national NHS politics since the early 2000s in his role as a British Medical Association negotiator and, more recently, as president of the Royal College of GPs.",
      "\"There just isn't enough of the right premises,\" he argues. \"In many places, GPs and community colleagues cannot work side-by-side because the buildings are too outdated and cramped.",
      "\"We've had all the talk over 40 new hospitals, but where are the 1,000 new neighbourhood clinics?\"",
      "Political pressure and short-term thinking",
      "There are deeper rooted political pressures too that make a nationwide rollout of centres like those in Birmingham a challenge.",
      "Even though the work in east Birmingham ticks a lot of the boxes set out by independent peer and NHS surgeon Lord Darzi in his report for the government last autumn, after being commissioned by Wes Streeting, this is not the first time such calls have been made. Lord Darzi himself set out similar goals in a report for the Blair government in 2007.",
      "Ms Rankine has had a front-row view of this. She worked for the Department of Health and NHS executive for more than a decade from the mid-1990s. \"We've been talking about this for 20, 30 years, but failed to achieve it on any sort of scale.\"",
      "And today, there are a series of contradictory priorities facing the NHS. Often it is those considered the most pressing that are addressed first.",
      "Hugh Alderwick, Director of Policy at the Health Foundation think-tank, who advised Labour in opposition, points out that the big focus is on hitting the 18-week hospital waiting time targets.",
      "\"It's pulling in the opposite direction of this ambition to move care out into the community,\" he observes.",
      "So can the government really reshape the NHS into a neighbourhood health service? Dr Vautrey, for one is optimistic.",
      "\"It can,\" he says. \"But it will take determination, effort \u2013 and money.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 08 Apr 2025 05:10:17 GMT",
    "summary": "Jonathan Peter Brooks tried to manipulate the forensic process, prison staff and the courts, a judge says.",
    "story": [
      "More than four years after he stabbed his colleague, plastic surgeon Jonathan Peter Brooks has been found guilty of attempted murder.",
      "On Monday, the 61-year-old was convicted over the 14 January 2021 attack on Graeme Perks in Halam, Nottinghamshire, which a court in Loughborough heard could easily have been fatal.",
      "It can now be reported that Brooks was never seen by the jury, repeatedly refusing to engage with the trial.",
      "In a legal saga stretching from his arrest, during a coronavirus lockdown, to his conviction, a judge outlined the \"extraordinary\" case, labelling Brooks a \"highly intelligent\" man who used hunger strikes and sacking his lawyers as tactics to try to manipulate the system to avoid justice.",
      "Why did the trial take so long?",
      "Brooks was arrested on the day of the attack, and appeared in court four days later.",
      "He dressed in camouflage gear and went to Mr Perks's home equipped with petrol, matches, a lighter, knife and a crowbar, but insisted all the items had been \"stored in his garage and had been acquired for innocent purposes\".",
      "His trial was told he smashed conservatory doors to spread petrol around the ground floor of Mr Perks's house, and then stabbed him in the abdomen.",
      "Brooks was facing an online NHS disciplinary hearing, which started on 11 January 2021.",
      "The court heard the burns specialist \"hated\" Mr Perks, who was a witness against him in those disciplinary proceedings.",
      "A trial originally began in July 2022, but the jury was discharged the following month after Brooks was admitted to hospital, suffering osteoradionecrosis - a medical complication of radiotherapy, which required surgery.",
      "This set in train a long chain of legal delays, with numerous occasions when hearings were listed but Brooks refused to turn up, forcing his case to be relisted and impacting on other court hearings - as barristers and judges had to move around their workloads.",
      "The trial has been listed on \"no fewer than nine occasions\", and the latest got under way despite Brooks sacking his then legal team with one day to go - the fifth time Brooks had dismissed one or more of his lawyers.",
      "Brooks had also embarked on a hunger strike 11 days before his trial was scheduled to start.",
      "Judge Edward Pepperall said this was not new.",
      "\"I identified no fewer than eight occasions since his arrest in 2021 when Dr Brooks had used hunger strikes or the threat of some other self-harm to achieve some advantage whether within the prison estate or in hospital,\" he said.",
      "Why was Brooks not co-operating?",
      "Brooks claimed he was not medically fit to stand trial, that accommodations were not being made in order for him to attend trial, and that the trial was unfair.",
      "By the time another trial was due to take place, he was left in the unusual position of acting as his own legal counsel.",
      "The dangers of defendants representing themselves without legal support are well-documented, and with Brooks also indicating a refusal to engage - while repeatedly claiming he would rather die than be wrongfully convicted - the court was faced with trying to arrange a trial in which an unrepresented defendant was not likely to turn up.",
      "Combined with Brooks's hunger strike, it presented the possibility that even if he was fit at the start of the trial, his condition could deteriorate during the weeks it was scheduled to run, and could mean a second trial would not reach a conclusion.",
      "Were allowances made for Brooks?",
      "In short, yes.",
      "The hunger strike meant the defendant had become increasingly weak, which led to the case being moved to Loughborough due to the defendant's new requirement for a wheelchair, something the original court could not accommodate.",
      "On 3 March this year, he did not appear for the slated start date, and the prosecution asked to continue the trial in the defendant's absence.",
      "Judge Pepperall came to a decision about whether it was fair for the trial to go ahead, with his ruling made on 6 March, a copy of which was sent to the defendant.",
      "In the 30-page document, he addressed the concerns prompted by Brooks going on hunger strike, and set out how he would ensure any trial would be fair.",
      "\"It is not too late for [Brooks] to change course and let the court know that he wishes to attend his trial... that he has already stopped his hunger strike, and that he is accepting all reasonable treatment so that he can in time recover sufficient health to put his case to the jury,\" he said.",
      "What happened during the trial?",
      "Tracy Ayling KC led the prosecution case against Brooks, who remained absent while also acting as his own legal representation.",
      "The situation was explained by Judge Pepperall to the jury, when he warned them not to take the defendant's absence as any sign of guilt.",
      "Evidence was then heard in the usual way, but on 11 March the judge said he had received a letter from Brooks, who was being held at HMP Bedford, in which he further objected to the trial continuing without him.",
      "A three-page response gave short shrift to Brooks's latest protests.",
      "\"Dr Brooks cannot refuse to engage with both the court and his lawyers, and then complain that he was not properly kept updated as to his case,\" he said.",
      "The trial continued, and on 24 March Stephen Leslie KC was brought in to cross-examine Mr Perks - a measure made to provide balance to the prosecution case.",
      "On 25 March, a new five-page ruling was made to allow Brooks to appear via video-link from prison should he so wish, rather than go in person.",
      "In the ruling, the judge spoke of Brooks's \"sporadic\" engagement.",
      "\"On no fewer than 13 occasions, he has declined to attend court, sometimes even when only required to appear by prison link, without good reason,\" he said.",
      "Addressing the behaviour of the defendant, the judge added: \"Dr Brooks has deliberately made himself ill in order to seek to manipulate the court process and prevent his trial from proceeding. Such conduct was the voluntary decision of a well-informed medical man with capacity.\"",
      "Following the ruling, the defendant continued to complain about his condition and the trial, and after assessment from doctors confirmed he was fit to attend but remained absent through his own choice, the prosecution case concluded.",
      "During a debate on Brooks's fitness during the trial, Ms Ayling said her prosecution team \"has anticipated\" such requests being made by the defendant.",
      "\"Yet again he's attempting to put off the trial,\" she said. \"He is deliberately manipulating the court and voluntarily absenting himself.\"",
      "Brooks did not turn up for his own defence, which was scheduled for 27 March, but on 1 April he finally made an appearance, addressing the trial in the absence of the jury via video-link from HMP Norwich, where he had recently been transferred.",
      "He requested a four-week adjournment so he could prepare his case, but he refused the offer of a 48-hour extension, ending up in tears as he said he felt he could not accept the judge's offers to accommodate a late speech from him.",
      "By the time the jury was brought in that day, Brooks had gone back to his cell, and so he was once again absent when the judge summed up the evidence.",
      "What can the courts do with defendants who will not engage?",
      "The criminal justice system stresses the importance of not only there being a fair trial, but there being seen to be a fair trial, so even though Brooks refused to co-operate, measures were taken to ensure due process was followed.",
      "For Brooks, a lawyer was brought in to challenge witness evidence, and while legal rulings were not discussed in front of the jury in order to avoid prejudicing their views, they were discussed before the press, so the legal discussions could be reported after trial.",
      "Ultimately, courts have to give the opportunity for defendants to appear, and if they refuse they must ensure the process is still fair, even if that leads to long delays.",
      "The Crown Prosecution Service said the trial \"was extremely unusual\".",
      "\"The lack of participation meant that straightforward and non-controversial evidence could not be agreed as would usually happen when a defendant is present and represented,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "\"This meant that some witnesses had to give evidence to the jury and have statements read out in full that would otherwise have been treated as agreed facts.\"",
      "A number of recent sentencings - including Kyle Clifford and Axel Rudakubana - saw defendants refuse to appear, and as a result the prime minister has promised to give judges the power to make criminals appear in the dock.",
      "Judge Pepperall said that he would write to the governor of HMP Norwich, where Brooks is currently held, to request that he attend in person for his sentencing hearing, which is due to be held on 3 June.",

    "summary": "Men are more likely to die prematurely than women - and worse at seeking care when they need it.",
    "story": [
      "This month the government in England will launch a consultation for its men's health strategy. The move is long overdue, experts say, with men much more likely to die prematurely than women. But why are they in such poor health \u2013 and what can be done about it?",
      "Andrew Harrison was running a men's health clinic from a youth centre in Bradford when he heard a knock. He turned to the door, but no-one was there. Then he heard his name being called. He looked around to see a young man at the window asking for condoms.",
      "\"I was on the first floor,\" he says, recounting the story from a few years ago. \"The lad had shimmied up a drainpipe on the outside of the building because he didn't want to go through the reception and ask.\"",
      "The anecdote, in many ways, encapsulates the challenges over men's health \u2013 a combination of risk-taking behaviour and a lack of confidence and skills to engage with health services.",
      "Early deaths",
      "In the UK men are more likely to smoke, drink alcohol, use drugs and have high cholesterol and blood pressure.",
      "These are major contributors to the fact men have a lower life expectancy than women - by four years - and are nearly 60% more likely to die prematurely before the age of 75 with heart disease, lung cancer, liver disease and in accidents.",
      "Prof Alan White, who co-founded the Men's Health Forum charity and set up a dedicated men's health centre at Leeds Beckett University, says the issue needs to be taken more seriously.",
      "He cites the pandemic as an example, pointing out that 19,000 more men than women died from Covid. \"Where was the outrage? Where was the attention?\"",
      "He says it is too easy to blame men's poor health on their lifestyles, arguing \"it's much more complex than that.\"",
      "He says there are biological reasons \u2013 the male immune system is less able to fight off infection. But, as the story of the young man seeking condoms above demonstrates, they can also lack the skills to access health services.",
      "Prof White says: \"Men are less health-literate, that is to say they don't develop the skills to talk about their health and recognise and act on the signs. Men's health is very static from their teenage years right through into their 40s generally \u2013 many go years without seeing a health professional.",
      "\"It is different for women. Getting contraception, having cervical screening and then childbirth means many women have regular contact with health services in a way men do not.\"",
      "Stark differences",
      "Machismo is also a factor, says Mark Brooks, the policy adviser for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Men's and Boy's Issues, which has played a key role in influencing the government to draw up a men's health strategy.",
      "\"In society we have different expectations in regards to men. They are expected to man up and get on with things, to be strong and resilient.\"",
      "But he says when it comes to men's health it is important to pay particular attention to the impact of deprivation. Life expectancy in the poorest 10% of areas is 10 years less than in the wealthiest \u2013 a larger gap than is seen for women \u2013 and in the most deprived areas a man is 3.5 times more likely to die before the age of 75.",
      "\"You cannot ignore the stark differences when it comes to left-behind communities and those working in blue-collar jobs like construction and manufacturing,\" he says. \"The way health services are designed isn't working for men.\"",
      "NHS health checks, which are offered every five years to those aged 40 to 74, are considered a crucial intervention when it comes to many of the diseases which are claiming the lives of men early. But fewer than four in 10 men take up the offer.",
      "\"Someone working in construction or on an industrial estate will find it very difficult to take time off whether that's for a health check or to go and see their GP.\"",
      "Mr Brooks says he would like to see employees given a right to two hours' paid time off to go for health checks as well as seeing them delivered in places where blue-collar workers are employed, such as industrial estates.",
      "But he says this is also an issue about employment - with some men in these roles scared to face up to health problems that develop in their 40s and 50s - ignoring early warning signs or hiding illnesses from bosses altogether because of what it may mean for their work.",
      "He adds that job worries and financial concerns, along with relationship problems,  are a big driver in the high suicide rates seen among men. Three-quarters of people who take their own lives are men.",
      "Despite this, just a third of people sent for talking therapies are men, which may suggest that services are not doing enough to consider men's needs.",
      "\"How services are set up to recognise signs of depression and anxiety is not how men express them \u2013 they are more likely to display signs of anger, abuse alcohol or become withdrawn and push people away,\" says Prof White.",
      "Ethnic differences are also important to recognise, he says. For example, black men in England are twice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, while men from Indian or Bangladeshi backgrounds are at particularly high risk of diabetes.",
      "Wake-up call",
      "But none of this means men are not interested in their own health, says Prof Paul Galdas, a men's health expert at York University. \"Men will open up and want to be engaged, but to do that you have to base it around actions and activities.\"",
      "He has helped develop a six-week mental fitness programme in partnership with the Movember men's health movement that has been trialled on NHS front-line workers following Covid. Now it is being used by Leeds United football club for its youth players.",
      "Men are provided with support to understand how behaviour affects moods, they are encouraged to track their habits and set goals for healthy activities.",
      "\"It can be about going for a walk, seeing friends, playing golf and developing problem-solving skills to protect mental health. Good mental health leads to good physical health.\"",
      "Similar activity-based initiatives can be found in a number of local areas where charities, councils and local men's groups have worked together to set up schemes.",
      "The Men's Sheds movement is perhaps the most well-known where men are encouraged to come together and bond and support each other while doing practical projects.",
      "Prof White says now is the time to build on these foundations \u2013 something a national men's health strategy is vital for. He says it will help \"shine a spotlight\" on the issue in a similar way to the women's health strategy did back in 2022 \u2013 that led to the creation of a network of women's health hubs and women's health champions at the heart of government.",
      "But he also wants it to act as a \"wake-up call\" for men themselves. He says there are some simple steps every man should consider.",
      "\"Look at your waist size \u2013 if you are carrying weight, if your tummy is too big try to do something. Get moving, get out and about and talk to people.",

      "It couldn't be a coincidence. The only possible explanation was a mistake or mix-up in that maternity ward more than seven decades ago.",
      "Until recently cases like this were unheard of in the UK, although there have been a handful of examples in other countries.",
      "The standard practice in the NHS today is to place two bands around babies' ankles immediately after birth and keep mother and child together through their hospital stay.",
      "In the 1950s maternity care was very different. Babies were often separated, placed in large nursery rooms and cared for by midwives.",
      "\"The whole system was far less sophisticated back then,\" says Jason Tang, from the London law firm Russell Cooke, which is representing Susan.",
      "\"It may be that staff didn't attach a card or tag immediately, or that it simply fell off and was put back on the wrong baby or on the wrong crib.\"",
      "From the late 1940s the UK also saw a post-war baby boom putting more pressure on busy maternity services in the newly formed NHS.",

      "She is not terminally ill, but the 39-year-old performance and burlesque artist has been approved for assisted dying under Canada's increasingly liberal laws.",
      "Warning: This article contains details and descriptions some readers may find disturbing",
      "She is speaking to BBC News from the Bus Stop Theatre, an intimate auditorium with a little under 100 seats, in the eastern city of Halifax, Nova Scotia.",
      "Illuminated by a single spotlight on a stage she has performed on many times before, she tells me she plans to die here \"within months\" of her imminent 40th birthday. She'll be joined by a small group of her family and friends.",
      "April plans to be in a \"big comfy bed\" for what she calls a \"celebratory\" moment when a medical professional will inject a lethal dose into her bloodstream.",
      "\"I want to be surrounded by the people I love and just have everybody hold me in a giant cuddle puddle and get to take my last breath, surrounded by love and support,\" she says.",
      "April was born with spina bifida and was later diagnosed with tumours at the base of her spine which she says have left her in constant, debilitating pain.",
      "She's been taking strong opioid painkillers for more than 20 years and applied for Medical Assistance in Dying (Maid) in March 2023. While she could yet live for decades with her condition, she qualified to end her life early seven months after applying. For those who are terminally ill it is possible to get approval within 24 hours.",
      "\"My suffering and pain are increasing and I don't have the quality of life anymore that makes me happy and fulfilled,\" April says. Every time she moves or breathes, she says it feels like the tissues from the base of her spine \"are being pulled like a rubber band that stretches too far\", and that her lower limbs leave her in agony.",
      "We meet April as, almost 3,000 miles away, MPs are scrutinising proposals to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales. They voted in principle in support of those plans in November 2024, but months of detailed scrutiny have followed - and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could possibly become law.",
      "This week, the BBC witnessed a man's death in California, where assisted dying laws are far more similar to those being considered in Westminster.",
      "Critics say Canada is an example of the \"slippery slope\", meaning that once you pass an assisted dying law it will inevitably widen its scope and have fewer safeguards.",
      "Canada now has one of the most liberal systems of assisted dying in the world, similar to that operating in the Netherlands and Belgium. It introduced Maid in 2016, initially for terminally ill adults with a serious and incurable physical illness, which causes intolerable suffering. In 2021, the need to be terminally ill was removed, and in two years' time, the Canadian government plans to open Maid to adults solely with a mental illness and no physical ailment.",
      "Opponents of Maid tell us that death is coming to be seen as a standard treatment option for those with disabilities and complex medical problems.",
      "\"It is easier in Canada to get medical assistance in dying than it is to get government support to live,\" says Andrew Gurza, a disability awareness consultant and friend of April's.",
      "Andrew, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair, says he respects April's decision, but tells us: \"If my disability declines and my care needs got higher, I'd still want to be here. To know there's a law that's saying you could easily end your life - it's just really scary.\"",
      "Before she was approved for Maid, April was assessed by two independent physicians who were required to inform her of ways to alleviate her suffering and offer alternative treatments.",
      "\"The safeguards are there,\" she says, when we press her about disabled people who feel threatened by assisted dying, or whether Maid is being used as a shortcut to better quality care. \"If it's not right for you and you're not leading the charge and choosing Maid, you're not going to be able to access it unless it's for the right reasons,\" she adds.",
      "There were 15,343 Maid deaths in 2023, representing around one in 20 of all deaths in Canada - a proportion that has increased dramatically since 2016 and is one of the highest in the world. The average age of recipients was 77.",
      "In all but a handful of cases, the lethal dose was delivered by a doctor or nurse, which is also known as voluntary euthanasia. One doctor we spoke to, Eric Thomas, said he had helped 577 patients to die.",
      "Dr Konia Trouton, president of the Canadian Association of Maid Assessors and Providers, has also helped hundreds of patients to die since the law was introduced.",
      "The procedure is the same each time - she arrives at the home of the person who has been given approval for Maid and asks if they wish to go ahead with it that day. She says the patients always direct the process and then give her the \"heads up and ready to go\".",
      "\"That gives me an honour and a duty and a privilege to be able to help them in those last moments with their family around them, with those who love them around them and to know that they've made that decision thoughtfully, carefully and thoroughly,\" she adds.  If the answer is yes, she opens her medical bag.",
      "Demonstrating to the BBC what happens next, Dr Trouton briefly puts a tourniquet on my arm. She shows me where the needle would be inserted into a vein in the back of my hand to allow an intravenous infusion of lethal drugs.",
      "In her medical bag she also has a stethoscope. \"Strangely, these days I use it more to determine if someone has no heartbeat rather than if they do,\" she tells me.",
      "A list of organisations in the UK offering support and information with some of the issues in this story is available at BBC Action Line",
      "Some 96% of Maid provisions are under \"track one\" where death is \"reasonably foreseeable\". Dr Trouton says that means patients are on a \"trajectory toward death\", which might range from someone who has rapidly spreading cancer and only weeks to live or another with Alzheimer's \"who might have five to seven years\".",
      "The other 4% of Maid deaths come under \"track two\". These are adults, like April, who are not dying but have suffering which is intolerable to them from a \"grievous and irremediable medical condition\".",
      "That is in stark contrast to Labour MP Kim Leadbeater's bill to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, which says patients must be expected to die within six months. The Westminster bill would not allow doctors to give a lethal dose \u2013 rather patients would have to self-administer the drugs, usually by swallowing them.",
      "Death via intravenous infusion normally takes just a few minutes, as the lethal drugs go straight into the bloodstream, whereas swallowing the drugs means patients usually take around an hour or two to die, but can take considerably longer, although they are usually unconscious after a few minutes.",
      "Dr Trouton told me she regarded the Canadian system as quicker and more effective, as do other Maid providers. \"I'm concerned that if some people can't swallow because of their disease process, and if they're not able to take the entire quantity of medication because of breathing difficulties or swallowing difficulties, what will happen?\"",
      "'Canada has fallen off a cliff'",
      "But opponents argue it's being used as a cheaper alternative to providing adequate social or medical support.",
      "One of them is Dr Ramona Coelho, a GP in London, Ontario, whose practice serves many marginalised groups and those struggling to get medical and social support. She's part of a Maid Death Review Committee, alongside Dr Trouton, which examines cases in the province.",
      "Dr Coelho told me that Maid was \"out of control\". \"I wouldn't even call it a slippery slope,\" she says \"Canada has fallen off a cliff.\"",
      "\"When people have suicidal ideations, we used to meet them with counselling and care, and for people with terminal illness and other diseases we could mitigate that suffering and help them have a better life,\" she says. \"Yet now we are seeing that as an appropriate request to die and ending their lives very quickly.\"",
      "While at Dr Coelho's surgery I was introduced to Vicki Whelan, a retired nurse whose mum Sharon Scribner died in April 2023 of lung cancer, aged 81. Vicki told me that in her mum's final days in hospital she was repeatedly offered the option of Maid by medical staff, describing it as like a \"sales pitch\".",
      "The family, who are Catholic, discharged their mother so she could die at home, where Vicki says her mum had a \"beautiful, peaceful death\". \"It makes us think that we can't endure, and we can't suffer a little bit, and that somehow now they've decided that dying needs to be assisted, where we've been dying for years.",
      "\"All of a sudden now we're telling people that this is a better option. This is an easy way out and I think it's just robbing people of hope.\"",
      "'Not a way I want to live'",
      "So is Canada an example of the so-called slippery slope? It's certainly true that the eligibility criteria has broadened dramatically since the law was introduced nine years ago, so for critics the answer would be an emphatic yes and serve as a warning to Britain.",
      "Canada's assisted dying laws were driven by court rulings. Its Supreme Court instructed Parliament that a prohibition on assisted dying breached the country's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The extension of eligibility for those who were not terminally ill was in part a response to another court decision.",
      "In Britain, judges in the most senior courts have repeatedly said any potential change to the law around assisted dying is a matter for Parliament, after the likes of Tony Nicklinson, Diane Pretty and Noel Conway brought cases arguing the blanket ban on assisted suicide breached their human rights.",
      "April knows some people may look at her, a young woman, and wonder why she would die.",
      "\"We're the masters of masking and not letting people see that we're suffering,\" she says. \"But in reality, there's days that I just can't hide it, and there's many days where I can't lift my head off the pillow and I can't eat anymore.",

      "It follows an inquiry into the UK TV and film industry which examined the effects of the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix, Amazon and Apple TV.",
      "The report noted how \"vital\" dramas such as Adolescence are to the country's \"identity, national conversations and talent pipeline\", which they say is now \"under threat\".",
      "It is \"time for streamers to put their money where their mouth is\", the report read, suggesting that streaming companies pay \"5% of their UK subscriber revenue into a cultural fund to help finance drama with a specific interest to British audiences\".",
      "Chair of the CMS committee, MP Dame Caroline Dinenage, noted how recent \"big box-office blockbusters made in Britain have showcased the UK's world-class film and high-end television industry like never before\".",
      "\"But the boom in inward investment of recent years now risks crowding out our many talented independent British producers,\" she said.",
      "She added: \"While streamers like Netflix and Amazon have proved a valuable addition for the industry and economy, unless the government urgently intervenes to rebalance the playing field, for every Adolescence adding to the national conversation, there will be countless distinctly British stories that never make it to our screens.\"",

      "The Association for Commercial Broadcasters and On-Demand Services (COBA) said a levy risks damaging streamers' investment in the UK.",
      "Coba executive director Adam Minns said: \"Especially in this economic climate, a levy risks impacting existing content budgets for UK shows, jobs, and growth, along with raising costs for businesses.",
      "\"Ironically, it could actually damage public service broadcaster dramas by reducing co-production budgets at streamers.\"",
      "He added pressure on domestic production stemmed from the real terms decline in the TV licence fee.",
      "The report released on Thursday noted how last year there was a 27% decrease in the number of domestic high-end TV productions made in the UK and a 25% fall in spend.",

    "story": [
      "The government has offered to buy the coking coal that is essential to keep steel production going at British Steel in Scunthorpe, the BBC has been told.",
      "British Steel has been warning for several days that the raw materials needed to keep its plant's two blast furnaces operational are running out.",
      "Sources said the government was putting the offer in writing to British Steel's Chinese owner Jingye, which will decide on whether to accept it.",
      "Separately government sources said the materials need to be paid for within the next two days or production will cease at the British Steel plant within weeks and cannot be restarted. The Department of Business and Trade did not comment.",
      "Jingye has said the furnaces are \"no longer financially sustainable\".",
      "Talks are set to resume between British Steel bosses and government officials on Thursday, with unions saying the situation is on a \"cliff-edge\".",
      "The government has not ruled out nationalising British Steel, which employs 2,700 people, saying all options remain on the table.",
      "Coking coal, which has to be imported, can take 45 days to arrive once it's been ordered. The plant also needs iron ore but that tends to arrive more quickly than coal.",
      "The government offer to purchase the raw materials is a way for it to buy time while negotiations over the future of the plant continue.",
      "Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds met with the CEOs of Jingye and British Steel on Wednesday.",
      "In a joint statement, they said ''Both sides welcomed continued cooperation in talks to find a way forward. The UK government thanked Jingye for their respect for the workforce during this process, and work continues at pace to find a resolution.\"",
      "Ministers are thought to prefer a commercial solution to secure the long-term future of the plant.",
      "But due to the urgent need to acquire new raw materials, talks about the longer-term future of steelmaking in Scunthorpe are now largely on hold.",
      "The immediate issue is who will pay for shipments of iron pellets and coke.",
      "One option being discussed is whether the government can directly buy the materials using taxpayers' money.",
      "It is understood that the easiest legal avenue would be to come to a deal with Jingye, whereby they agree to carry on running the plant, as long as the government pays for the raw materials.",
      "British Steel solution is within reach, minister says",
      "'Scunthorpe could become a disaster town'",
      "When Jingye announced last month that thousands of jobs were at risk, that triggered a consultation period that legally must last a minimum of 45 days.",
      "Government representatives are said to be frustrated with Jingye, at what they see as an effective shutting down of British Steel, with the consultation period still ongoing.",
      "One source involved in the negotiations, who two weeks ago was optimistic about the future relationship between Jingye and the UK government, said they could no longer foresee long-term Chinese involvement in British steelmaking.",
      "One source said the government is now likely to look for an alternative commercial partner, outside of China, to take over the steelmaking operations at Scunthorpe.",
      "Alun Davies, national secretary in charge of steel and metals for the Community Union, said the raw materials issue was an \"extreme emergency\" .",
      "\"We just need them to be paid for, once that happens then there can be further discussions with the government about how we secure steel making for Scunthorpe,\" he told the BBC.",
      "Emerging from talks, Linda McCulloch from the Unite union said they would like the government to nationalise the site \"to keep steelmaking alive in the UK\".",
      "One of Scunthorpe's blast furnaces is set to be temporarily shut down next week, in order to buy more time before the raw materials needed to keep the steelworks going run out.",
      "The North Lincolnshire town's skyline boasts four blast furnaces, all named after English Queens - Bess, Mary, Anne and Victoria.",
      "Bess and Anne are currently the only two steelmaking blast furnaces operational in the UK.",
      "Turning off a blast furnace without making it permanently unusable is notoriously difficult.",
      "A so-called \"Salamander Tap\" can be used to temporarily shut down a blast furnace by drilling a hole to remove any remaining hot metal.",
      "It is seen as a generally dangerous process, but engineers on site at Scunthorpe are now confident they can carry out the procedure.",
      "The \"Bess\" blast furnace is currently scheduled to be taken temporarily out of action on 14 April.",
      "This would leave \"Anne\" as the only remaining operational blast furnace in the country, but would mean raw material stockpiles last twice as long.",
      "Reform UK is calling for British Steel to be nationalised until a buyer can be found.",
      "The Green Party also favours nationalisation and a switch to \"green\" steel production.",

      "The ex-employees agreed to keep the details of their complaints confidential under non-disclosure agreements.",

      "Abtisam Mohamed has said the Israeli government's decision to stop her and fellow Labour MP Yuan Yang from entering the country was \"about censorship and control\".",

      "In a statement to MPs, Foreign Office Minister Hamish Falconer said he believed it was the first time a British MP had been barred from entering Israel.",
      "He said their treatment had been \"unacceptable and deeply concerning\" and was \"no way to treat democratically elected representatives of a close partner nation\".",

      "Her stance was echoed in Parliament by the Conservative shadow Foreign Office spokesperson Wendy Morton.",
      "She said the UK Foreign Office's guidance said \"Israeli authorities decide if you can enter Israel\" and that \"some visitors may face longer searches and questioning, including those who are considered to have publicly criticised the State of Israel\".",
      "Morton asked Falconer if he accepted that \"British nationals visiting Israel, a country that is at war, should be aware of those requirements and consider them carefully before making decisions to travel and that they therefore travel to Israel at their own risk?\"",
      "Falconer said he was \"truly surprised\" by her response and urged Badenoch to apologise for her comments.",
      "He said Israel had the right to decide who came to the country but added: \"On this occasion, the two members of Parliament were given clearance to enter and so it was known to the Israeli government before they arrived at the airport that they would be travelling.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat MP Monica Harding said she was \"deeply disappointed\" by Morton's comments.",

      "The government has announced a relaxation of electric vehicle (EV) sales targets to help the car industry in the face of trade tariffs from the US.",
      "A ban selling new petrol and diesel cars will still come into effect in 2030, but manufacturers will now have more flexibility on annual targets and face lower fines.",
      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander told BBC Breakfast its changes were not a \"silver bullet\" but part of the solution to responding to US tariffs.",

      "It came into force last week and is separate to a 10% tax on nearly all UK products announced by Trump on Wednesday.",
      "A consultation on the government's EV target changes ended in mid-February, but Alexander told the BBC that the government had sped up the process of introducing them in response to the tariffs.",
      "The government said it had worked with UK car manufacturers to simultaneously \"strengthen its commitment to the phase out\" while introducing \"practical reforms to support industry meet this ambition\".",
      "Currently, 28% of new cars sold in the UK this year must be electric, a target that will rise each year until 2030.",
      "But manufacturers will now be given more freedom in how they meet their yearly targets - meaning if they don't sell enough EVs in one year, they can make up for it by selling more the next year, for example.",

      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said the changes are \"very much needed\".",
      "However, Robert Forrester, chief executive of car dealership chain Vertu Motors, told the BBC said there were \"lots and lots of words in the announcement but it doesn't really address the major issues\".",

    "story": [
      "Hundreds of public bodies are to be reviewed in a bid to cut spending and give ministers more decision-making powers.",
      "Cabinet Office Minister Pat McFadden has written to government departments asking them to justify the existence of every taxpayer-funded organisation not directly controlled by ministers.",
      "Some of these organisations, known as quangos, could be closed, merged, or have their responsibilities handed over to departments.",
      "The BBC has been told ministers are considering passing a new law that would make it easier to scrap multiple quangos at once.",
      "A government source said the review had no completion date, and ministers had not set a target for how many quangos, or quasi-autonomous non-governmental organisations, they wanted to abolish.",
      "The source said the review be particularly focused on quangos dealing with policy issues of national importance.",
      "The review comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer announced plans to abolish NHS England, which Labour has described as the world's biggest quango.",
      "The organisation will be brought into the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), in a radical overhaul of the management structure of the NHS.",
      "The move is part of the government's drive to slim down the Civil Service, with a view to saving money and restructuring how the state works.",
      "Last month, Sir Keir told his ministers they should take more responsibility for decisions rather than \"outsourcing\" them to regulators.",
      "Could Starmer's regulation shake-up mean a 'bonfire of the quangos'?",
      "Abolishing NHS England is radical - why do it?",
      "Quangos are organisations such as regulators, cultural institutions and advisory bodies, which are funded by taxpayers but not directly controlled from Whitehall.",
      "They range from huge organisations like NHS England, to smaller ones like the Gambling Commission and the British Film Institute.",
      "Some - such as the Environment Agency, or the broadcasting regulator Ofcom - have powers to make decisions without ministerial input.",
      "The Cabinet Office's review will consider four key principles, including the importance of ministerial oversight of key policy areas and government efficiency.",
      "There will be a presumption that all quangos could be scrapped unless there is a compelling reason to keep them, the Cabinet Office said.",
      "But some quangos that scrutinise the government or protect the rule of law will remain unaffected.",
      "McFadden said the government wants to \"ensure decisions of national importance that affect everyone in this country are made by those who have been elected to do so\".",
      "He added: \"The review will aim to drive out waste and inefficiency across Whitehall, reducing duplication and bureaucracy - saving the taxpayer money and cutting the cost of 'doing government'.\"",
      "'Handle it properly'",
      "Since Labour won the general election last year, government has set up a number of new quangos, including Great British Energy, which invests in clean power sources.",
      "Previous governments have taken an axe to these organisations, with the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition getting rid of hundreds in a so-called bonfire of quangos from 2010.",
      "But trade unions are wary of further cuts, and fear they could mean jobs losses in the Civil Service.",
      "\"If they target up to 50% job cuts - as they are pursuing with the NHS England and DHSC merger \u2013 the government seriously risks undermining their own agenda,\" said Lucille Thirlby, assistant general secretary of the FDA, a union representing senior civil servants.",
      "Fran Heathcote, boss of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union, which represents civil servants below the senior rank, said ministers \"must ensure that there is proper engagement with the unions\".",
      "She said: \"If these changes are to be a success, our members will obviously need guarantees on their job security and pay and conditions.",

      "Suspended Labour MP, John McDonnell, who represents Hayes and Harlington in Parliament and previously held the position of shadow chancellor, also told Access All of his \"shock and anger\" at the plans, and said he was \"praying\" for a government U-turn.",
      "Initially, the government's reforms to benefits were intended to make savings of \u00a35bn a year by 2030, but the Office for Budget Responsibility has revised government figures, projecting a lower net saving of \u00a33.4bn.",
      "The government says that without radical reforms to the benefit system it could cost the tax payer as much as \u00a370bn annually by the end of the decade.",
      "To make savings, other planned changes include freezing extra payments for existing claimants of Universal Credit and almost halving them for new applicants.",
      "The government says some of the money saved will be reinvested into work programmes targeting youth unemployment.",
      "Alongside the 12-week consultation, which ends on 30 June, the government has announced the formation of \"collaboration committees\" which will involve civil servants working with disability experts and those with lived experience to  \"provide discussion, challenge, and recommendations\" to inform government proposals.",

    "story": [
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the era of globalisation has \"ended\" following Donald Trump's new tariffs.",
      "It comes after Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer suggested in a Sunday Telegraph article he was about to announce state intervention to protect UK firms from the US president's move.",
      "The UK was among nations hit with a 10% \"baseline\" import duty, and negotiations on a trade deal to reduce tariffs are continuing.",
      "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch disagreed that globalisation was over and pointed to \"great\" trading relationships with other countries.",
      "Starmer vows to protect UK businesses from tariff 'storm'",
      "UK draws up list of US products it could hit with tariffs",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Some analysts fear a global recession following Trump's so-called Liberation Day, when he announced sweeping import taxes, sparking retaliatory action from countries including China and Canada.",
      "The prime minister has said the government \"will do everything necessary to protect Britain's national interest\" and is \"ready to use industrial policy\" to help shelter businesses, because \"the world as we know it has gone\".",
      "Speaking to the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Jones was asked whether globalisation - which has resulted in a boom in imports of cheap fashion, electrical goods and other products - was over.",
      "\"Yeah it's ended, the prime minister said that himself this morning,\" he said.",
      "\"Globalisation as we've known it for the last couple of decades has come to an end.\"",
      "The change meant the UK had to \"build out\" relationships with allies around the world but also invest in the UK's own economy, Jones said, denying ministers were \"scrabbling\" for solutions.",
      "He insisted the government was \"trying to get ahead of these challenges\", and that was why the government is \"investing in the NHS and skills as well as industrial policy\".",
      "Amid reports that elements of the spending review and the industrial strategy could be brought forward from their expected June publication date, Jones said Labour had been working on the industrial strategy since it was in opposition.",
      "Pressed on whether measures would be brought forward, Jones deferred to Sir Keir's announcement expected in the coming days and laughed when Kuenssberg said \"that sounds almost like a yes, but you're not allowed to say it to us this morning\".",
      "The UK government has continued its policy of not responding to US tariffs with counter-tariffs, as other countries have done - preferring, ministers have said, a \"calm\" approach focused on a UK-US trade deal.",
      "\"We're hoping to do a deal,\" Jones said, adding that \"we have a better outcome than other comparable countries as a consequence of our diplomacy\" on tariffs.",
      "The Liberal Democrats have called for MPs to be allowed to vote on any deal struck with Trump due to concerns about the possibility of changes to regulations around farming, online content and the digital services tax on US social media giants.",
      "The party's deputy leader Daisy Cooper said it would be \"deeply undemocratic\" to sideline Parliament on these \"critical\" issues.",
      "She said: \"Both Conservative and Labour MPs should commit now to voting down any Trump deal that sells out British farmers and their high food standards or waters down our online safety rules.\"",
      "Asked to rule out watering down the Online Safety Act, Labour's Jones said protections for children are \"non-negotiable\" and committed to ensuring that social media platforms are \"designed in a way that protects children from harm\".",
      "Environment Secretary Steve Reed has previously said \"we won't undercut British farmers on welfare or environmental standards\" in order to secure a US trade deal.",
      "However, earlier this month, Chancellor Rachel Reeves suggested the UK could change its taxes on big tech firms as part of a deal to overturn US tariffs, despite the digital services tax bringing in about \u00a3800m per year since its introduction in 2020.",
      "Speaking on the Kuenssberg programme, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch agreed that retaliatory tariffs were not a solution because they would only harm UK consumers.",
      "However, she said she did not agree that globalisation was over, insisting what was happening was only \"fragmentation\", adding \"we still have a great trading relationship with many other countries\".",
      "Badenoch added the Labour government should pick up the deal former Prime Minister Boris Johnson had tried to negotiate with Trump during his previous presidency, which ended in 2020.",
      "Johnson and his successor Liz Truss tried to push Trump's predecessor Joe Biden to open trade talks but negotiations petered out without a deal being struck.",
      "Rishi Sunak managed to agree the Atlantic Declaration with Biden, including commitments on easing trade barriers, closer defence industry ties, a data protection deal and more co-operation on AI.",
      "Asked whether a UK-US trade deal was indeed \"oven-ready\", as Badenoch has previously claimed several times, the Tory leader suggested the government should \"pick up where we left off\".",
      "She continued: \"We had six rounds of negotiations where there were some decisions that were concluded and they can pick that up and take it.",
      "\"The most important thing is removing tariffs -  the tariffs are going to be disruptive for our businesses... That is going to make a whole mess of the tax take that [Chancellor] Rachel Reeves thought she was going to be getting in her budget.",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",
      "Apple declined to comment.",
      "In a previous statement it told the BBC:  \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",
      "They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.",
      "Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.",

      "Ms Ghey, who has called for children under 16 to stop having access to social media on smartphones, has previously met the prime minister to discuss online safety but called on him to take a tougher approach.",
      "She told the BBC: \"Young people shouldn't be struggling with mental health because of what they are accessing online, and we really do need to take a hard stance on this.\"",
      "She said she supported a \"blanket ban\" on smartphones in schools in England.",
      "Roxy Longworth, who spoke to the BBC alongside Ms Ghey, was coerced into sending nude pictures to a boy at school when she was just 13, and subsequently experienced serious mental health problems.",
      "Ms Longworth said she wanted to bridge the growing \"generation gap\" around social media.",
      "\"A lot of young people I've spoken to have said that they're scared to tell their parents about anything they see online, because they're worried their phones will be taken away as punishment,\" she said.",
      "A government spokesperson said the Online Safety Act means online platforms \"must now prevent illegal material appearing on their sites\" and that the bill's next phase will \"ensure children only see age-appropriate content online\".",
      "They added: \"We have commissioned research on the impact of social media and smartphones on children's well-being.",
      "\"This evidence base will help inform next steps in the safety of children online.\"",
      "Former Children's Commissioner Baroness Anne Longfield told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the Online Safety Act \"doesn't seem to have the teeth needed\" to hold tech companies to account.",
      "The Labour peer said social media and tech companies were doing only a \"minute\" amount to keep children safe online, and that the regulator Ofcom needed strengthening in order to regulate social media firms.",
      "She continued: \"This is a big business model which makes big money, and they want to keep kids online, they want to get them hooked early.",
      "\"What we have to do is to protect those kids online, so I do think we need to do more, we need to strengthen our regulation.\"",
      "Baroness Longfield also said banning phones in schools should be kept under review to \"see whether we need to go further\", because they are \"addictive by design\".",
      "Some campaigners and opposition politicians are concerned legislation around online safety could be watered down, with the Liberal Democrats among those warning of pressure from Donald Trump to dilute regulations in exchange for improved trading terms.",
      "Asked about that prospect, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones told Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg that the Online Safety Act was \"not negotiable, because it's the principle that if it's illegal offline, it should be illegal online\".",
      "Jones added: \"Where there is harmful content online, especially where it's targeted at children, these social platforms need to be designed in a way that protects children from that harm. We won't be walking away from that.\"",
      "Elsewhere in the interview, Ms Ghey said she would now consider Emma Jenkinson, the mother of one of Brianna's killers, \"a friend\", having first met her in March last year.",
      "\"I really appreciate Emma,\" she told the programme. \"She's just a normal mother and she had no idea what her child was accessing. This is the danger with smartphones.",
      "\"I suppose it's helped me in a way. You can make up stories in your own head about the way people are.\"",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work will without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",
      "\"The measure would be a severe blow to the entire market for waste-based biofuels,\" it said.",

    "story": [
      "For 20 years, Rj LaMendola found peace while paddling in the water on his surfboard.",
      "But last month off the coast of Southern California, the ocean turned hostile after a sea lion lunged at him, bit him and dragged him off his board.",
      "\"It looked possessed,\" Mr LaMendola wrote in a Facebook post, saying the animal involved in the encounter just north of Los Angeles was \"feral, almost demonic\".",
      "The surfer later learned the animal was suffering from domoic acid toxicosis- a neurological condition caused by a harmful algal bloom. It's one of dozens of sickened animals that have been spotted across California beaches recently - many suffering from symptoms like seizures or intense lethargy. The toxin often leads to death.",
      "This particular algae bloom has appeared four years in a row across California, raising concerns it might be turning into an annual event. The bloom of algae started earlier than normal this year and has spread roughly 370 miles of the iconic Southern California coastline.",
      "When Mr LaMenolda made it to shore, his wetsuit ripped open, he was bleeding and went to the hospital. \"It felt like I was being hunted,\" he said.",
      "South of where he was attacked, 15-year-old Phoebe Beltran was doing a swim test in Long Beach to become a lifeguard when a sea lion repeatedly bit her.",
      "\"I was just so scared, so shocked, but I still felt the immense pain on my arms, like, over and over again,\" the teen told local US media.",
      "The two back-to-back attacks have garnered global headlines and caused some anxiety among those who call California and its iconic beaches home. While attacks are rare, experts say the number of animals sickened by the toxic algae bloom appears to be increasing.",
      "John Warner, CEO of the Marine Mammal Care Center in Los Angeles - which is treating sea life sickened by the bloom - told the BBC these animals aren't \"naturally aggressive or actually attack people\" but the toxins impact their behaviour.",
      "\"These animals are reacting to the fact that they are sick,\" he explained. \"They're disoriented, and most likely, most of them are having seizures, and so their senses are not all fully functional as they normally would and they're acting out of fear.\"",
      "Domoic acid builds up in smaller fish like sardines and anchovies, which are eaten by marine predators such as dolphins, seals and sea lions in large quantities, causing them to get sick.",
      "Exposure to the acid causes serious neurological issues in sea lions, including seizures, disorientation and a telltale head-tilting behaviour known as \"stargazing.\"",
      "Some animals fall into a lethargic and comatose state, while others can turn aggressive.",
      "\"Their behaviour changes from what we're used to, to something more unpredictable,\" Mr Warner said. \"But in this particular bloom, we're seeing them really comatose and rather taken out by this toxin.\"",
      "The Marine Mammal Care Center is currently overwhelmed with the influx and severity of sick animals.",
      "According to Mr Warner, the nonprofit has admitted at least 195 sea lions from Feb 20 to the end of March. During the same time frame last year, the centre saw only 50 of the animals.",
      "If treated promptly, sea lions have a 50% to 65% chance of recovery, but Mr Warner says the centre is running out of space and money to treat the animals. Treatment includes anti-seizure medication and sedation, followed by twice-daily tube feeding and hydration.",
      "On top of that, the recovery pace this year has been slower, he said.",
      "While sick sea lions in 2023 typically began eating within a week, many this year are still lethargic five weeks into care.",
      "Recovery comes in stages: from a comatose state to disorientation, then aggressive reawakening\u2014when the animals are most dangerous due to lingering neurological effects.",
      "Adult sea lions can weigh hundreds of pounds, and aggressive behaviors make housing them complicated. If their behaviour doesn't normalize, it could signal permanent brain damage, and humane euthanasia becomes necessary.",
      "\"If they're still aggressive or not foraging properly, it tells us their brains aren't functioning the way they should,\" Mr Warner said.",
      "For now, beachgoers are urged to stay well away from stranded animals - at least 50 feet - and resist the temptation to intervene.",
      "\"These are still the same charismatic, really fun-to-watch expert cuddle puddlers that we see along the coast all the time,\" Mr Warner said. \"We need to remember they are wild animals. They can be unpredictable even in normal circumstances.\""

      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",

      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",
      "\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.",

      "There is a magnificent, snow-white wolf on the cover of Time Magazine today - accompanied by a headline announcing the return of the dire wolf.",

      "How extinct animals could be brought back from the dead",
      "Woolly mice designed to engineer mammoth-like elephants",
      "Paleogeneticist Dr Nic Rawlence, also from Otago University, explained how ancient dire wolf DNA - extracted from fossilised remains - is too degraded and damaged to biologically copy or clone.",
      "\"Ancient DNA is like if you put fresh DNA in a 500 degree oven overnight,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"It comes out fragmented - like shards and dust.",
      "\"You can reconstruct [it], but it's not good enough to do anything else with.\"",
      "Instead, he added, the de-extinction team used new synthetic biology technology - using the ancient DNA to identify key segments of code that they could edit into the biological blueprint of a living animal, in this case a grey wolf.",
      "\"So what Colossal has produced is a grey wolf, but it has some dire wolf-like characteristics, like a larger skull and white fur,\" said Dr Rawlence. \"It's a hybrid.\"",
      "Dr Beth Shapiro, a biologist from Colossal Biosciences, said that this feat does represent de-extinction, which she described as recreating animals with the same characteristics.",
      "\"A grey wolf is the closest living relative of a dire wolf - they're genetically really similar - so we targeted DNA sequences that lead to dire wolf traits and then edited grey wolf cells... then we cloned those cells and created our dire wolves.\"",
      "According to Dr Rawlence though, dire wolves diverged from grey wolves anywhere between 2.5 to six million years ago.",
      "\"It's in a completely different genus to grey wolves,\" he said. \"Colossal compared the genomes of the dire wolf and the grey wolf, and from about 19,000 genes, they determined that 20 changes in 14 genes gave them a dire wolf.\"",
      "The edited embryos were implanted in surrogate domestic dog mothers. According to the article in Time, all three wolves were born by planned caesarean section to minimise the risk of complications.",
      "Colossal, which was valued at $10bn (\u00a37.8bn) in January, is keeping the wolves on a private 2,000-acre facility at an undisclosed location in the northern US.",
      "The pups certainly look like many people's vision of a dire wolf and the story has gathered global attention. So why is this scientific distinction important?",
      "\"Because extinction is still forever,\" Dr Rawlence told BBC News. \"If we don't have extinction, how are we going to learn from our mistakes?",
      "\"Is the message now that we can go and destroy the environment and that animals can go extinct, but we can bring them back?\""

    "summary": "The BBC finds evidence of fraud in the production of a \"green\" diesel meant to cut emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The UK government is investigating a fast-growing \"green fuel\" called HVO diesel amid claims of significant fraud, the BBC has learned.",
      "HVO is increasingly popular as a transport fuel and for powering music festivals and its backers say it can curb carbon emissions by up to 90% as it can be made from waste materials like used cooking oil.",
      "But industry whistleblowers told the BBC they believe large amounts of these materials are not waste but instead are virgin palm oil, which is being fraudulently relabelled.",
      "And data analysed by the BBC and shared with the UK's Department for Transport casts further doubt on one of the key ingredients in HVO, a material called palm sludge waste.",
      "Europe used more of this waste in HVO and other biofuels in 2023 than it is thought possible for the world to produce.",
      "In response to the BBC's findings, the Department for Transport said they \"take the concerns raised seriously and are working with stakeholders and international partners to gather further information\".",
      "HVO, or hydrotreated vegetable oil, has been called something of a wonder-fuel in recent years as it can be used as 100% substitute for diesel reducing planet warming emissions.",
      "UK consumption rocketed from 8 million litres in 2019 to about 699 million litres in 2024, according to provisional government figures.",
      "Its green credentials rely heavily on the assumption that it is made from waste sources, particularly used cooking oil or the waste sludge from palm oil production.",
      "But industry whistle-blowers have told the BBC that they believe virgin palm oil and other non-waste materials are often being used instead.",
      "That would be bad news for the planet, as virgin palm oil is linked to increased tropical deforestation, which adds to climate change and threatening endangered species like orang-utans.",
      "This palm oil \"floods the market like cancer,\" one large European biofuel manufacturer told the BBC.",
      "They said that to stay in business they have to go along with the pretence that they are using waste materials.",
      "Another whistle-blower, a former trader of these biofuels, also speaking anonymously, gave the BBC his account of one recent case dealing with supposedly waste products.",
      "\"I believe that what I bought was multiple cargos of virgin palm oil that has been wrongly classified as palm oil sludge,\" they said.",
      "\"I called one of the board members and told them about the situation, and then I was told that they didn't want to do anything about it, because the evidence would be burned.\"",
      "As well as this testimony, data compiled by campaign group Transport & Environment and analysed by the BBC suggests that more palm sludge waste is being used for transport biofuels than the world is probably able to produce.",
      "The figures show that the UK and EU used about two million tonnes of palm sludge waste for HVO and other biofuels in 2023, based on Eurostat and UK Department for Transport figures.",
      "EU imports of this sludge appear to have risen further in 2024, according to preliminary UN trade data, although the UK appears to have bucked this trend.",
      "But the data analysed by the BBC, which is based on well-established UN and industry statistics, suggests the world can only produce just over one million tonnes of palm sludge waste a year.",
      "This mismatch further suggests non-waste fuels such as  virgin palm oil are being used to meet Europe's rapid growth in biofuels, according to researchers and industry figures.",
      "\"It's a very easy game,\" said Dr Christian Bickert, a German farmer and editor with experience in biofuels, who believes that much of the HVO made with these waste products is \"fake\".",
      "\"Chemically, the sludge and the pure palm oil are absolutely the same because they come from the same plant, and also from the same production facilities in Indonesia,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"There's no paper which proves [the fraud], no paper at all, but the figures tell a clear story.\"",
      "Underpinning the sustainability claims of biofuels is an independent system of certification where producers have to show exactly where they get their raw materials from.",
      "It is mainly administered by a company called ISCC, and in Europe it has a long-standing reputation for ensuring that waste materials turned into fuel really do come from waste, by working with national authorities.",
      "But in Indonesia, Malaysia and China, three of the main sources of the raw ingredients claimed to be waste for HVO, supervision is much more difficult.",
      "\"ISCC is simply not allowed to send anybody to China,\" said Dr Christian Bickert.",
      "\"They have to rely on certification companies in China to check that everything is OK, but China doesn't allow any inspectors in from outside.\"",
      "This concern is echoed by several other groups contacted by the BBC.",
      "Construction giant Balfour Beatty, for example, has a policy of not using the fuel, citing sustainability concerns.",
      "\"We just are not able to get any level of visibility over the supply chain of HVO that would give us that level of assurance that this is truly a sustainable product,\" Balfour Beatty's Jo Gilroy told BBC News.",
      "The European Waste-based and Advanced Biofuels Association represents the major biofuel manufacturers in the EU and UK.",
      "In a statement they said \"there is a major certification verification issue that needs to be addressed as a matter of priority\", adding that the \"ISCC should do much more to ensure that non-EU Biodiesel is really what it claims to be\".",
      "In the light of growing fraud allegations, the Irish authorities have recently restricted incentives for fuels made from palm waste.",
      "The BBC also understands that the EU is about to propose a ban on ISCC certification of waste biofuels for two-and-a-half years, although it is expected to say it is not aware of direct breaches of renewable goals.",
      "It would then be up to individual member countries to decide whether to accept certifications.",
      "In response, the ISCC said it was \"more than surprised\" by the EU's move, adding that it had been \"a frontrunner in implementing the most strict and effective measures to ensure integrity and fraud prevention in the market for years\".",

      "The big picture is that the rise in the global demand for electricity continues to outpace the growth in renewable energy.",

      "Because the wreck is so large and lies in the gloom of the deep, exploring it with submersibles only shows tantalising snapshots. The scan, however, provides the first full view of the Titanic.",
      "The immense bow lies upright on the seafloor, almost as if the ship were continuing its voyage.",
      "But sitting 600m away, the stern is a heap of mangled metal. The damage was caused as it slammed into the sea floor after the ship broke in half.",
      "The new mapping technology is providing a different way to study the ship.",
      "\"It's like a crime scene: you need to see what the evidence is, in the context of where it is,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"And having a comprehensive view of the entirety of the wreck site is key to understanding what happened here.\"",
      "The scan shows new close-up details, including a porthole that was most likely smashed by the iceberg. It tallies with the eye-witness reports of survivors that ice came into some people's cabins during the collision.",
      "Experts have been studying one of the Titanic's huge boiler rooms - it's easy to see on the scan because it sits at the rear of the bow section at the point where the ship broke in two.",
      "Passengers said that the lights were still on as the ship plunged beneath the waves.",
      "The digital replica shows that some of the boilers are concave, which suggests they were still operating as they were plunged into the water.",
      "Lying on the deck of the stern, a valve has also been discovered in an open position, indicating that steam was still flowing into the electricity generating system.",
      "This would have been thanks to a team of engineers led by Joseph Bell who stayed behind to shovel coal into the furnaces to keep the lights on.",
      "All died in the disaster but their heroic actions saved many lives, said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"They kept the lights and the power working to the end, to give the crew time to launch the lifeboats safely with some light instead of in absolute darkness,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"They held the chaos at bay as long as possible, and all of that was kind of symbolised by this open steam valve just sitting there on the stern.\"",
      "A new simulation has also provided further insights into the sinking.",
      "It takes a detailed structural model of the ship, created from Titanic's blueprints, and also information about its speed, direction and position, to predict the damage that was caused as it hit the iceberg.",
      "\"We used advanced numerical algorithms, computational modelling and supercomputing capabilities to reconstruct the Titanic sinking,\" said Prof Jeom-Kee Paik, from University College London, who led the research.",
      "The simulation shows that as the ship made only a glancing blow against the iceberg it was left with a series of punctures running in a line along a narrow section of the hull.",
      "Titanic was supposed to be unsinkable, designed to stay afloat even if four of its watertight compartments flooded.",
      "But the simulation calculates the iceberg's damage was spread across six compartments.",
      "\"The difference between Titanic sinking and not sinking are down to the fine margins of holes about the size of a piece of paper,\" said Simon Benson, an associate lecturer in naval architecture at the University of Newcastle.",
      "\"But the problem is that those small holes are across a long length of the ship, so the flood water comes in slowly but surely into all of those holes, and then eventually the compartments are flooded over the top and the Titanic sinks.\"",
      "Unfortunately the damage cannot be seen on the scan as the lower section of the bow is hidden beneath the sediment.",
      "The human tragedy of the Titanic is still very much visible.",
      "Personal possessions from the ship's passengers are scattered across the sea floor.",
      "The scan is providing new clues about that cold night in 1912, but it will take experts years to fully scrutinise every detail of the 3D replica.",
      "\"She's only giving her stories to us a little bit at a time,\" said Parks Stephenson.",
      "\"Every time, she leaves us wanting for more.\""

    "story": [
      "Banning phones in schools should be a decision for head teachers and not \"imposed nationally by the government\", England's children's commissioner has said.",
      "Nine in ten secondary schools restrict the use of smartphones, according to a survey of 19,000 schools and colleges commissioned by Dame Rachel de Souza.",
      "Dame Rachel said children were racking up hours of screen time at home instead, and that parents needed more help managing their children's online habits.",
      "Her comments come as the general secretary of the UK's largest teaching union said a government ban on phones would \"take the pressure off schools\".",
      "Dame Rachel's survey suggests 99.8% of primary and 90% of secondary schools limit pupils' use of phones during the school day.",
      "Most primary schools (76%) require pupils to hand in their phones or leave them in a secure place during the day, whereas most secondary schools (79%) say phones must be kept out of sight and not used.",
      "The survey did not cover how thoroughly these policies are implemented, or their success rate.",
      "A separate survey of 502 eight to 15-year-olds, also commissioned by Dame Rachel, suggests:",
      "69% of children spend more than two hours a day on a device23% of children spend more than four hours a day",
      "69% of children spend more than two hours a day on a device",
      "23% of children spend more than four hours a day",
      "\"These children are not spending these hours on their phones while sat in school,\" Dame Rachel said in a new report. \"It goes much wider than that.\"",
      "She said parents and carers \"need to be supported in managing their children's online activities and setting appropriate boundaries\", and technology companies must \"take responsibility for making the online world safe by design\".",
      "Schools, meanwhile, should \"continue to have clear policies on phone use\" and also educate young people about online risks.",
      "\"Any head teacher who decides to ban mobile phones from their school has my full backing \u2013 but it should always be their choice, based on their knowledge of what's best for the children in their own classrooms, not a direction imposed nationally by the government,\" Dame Rachel said.",
      "However, her report also recommended the government should \"conduct more research into the potential benefits of wider restrictions on children's use of phones, particularly social media\".",
      "A government spokesperson said social media platforms already have to take down illegal material under the Online Safety Act, and the same law would soon protect children from other harmful online content including misogyny and violence.",
      "And the government has said there is already guidance on how schools can restrict the use of phones, which head teachers can decide how to put into practice.",
      "But Daniel Kebede, the general secretary of the National Education Union, said he believed a government ban on smartphones in schools would \"assist parents, but also take the pressure off schools\".",
      "\"Most schools do have rules in place, but [a ban] would create a uniformity across the school system, which would be very important and ensure that a new culture was developed in which smartphones were not in possession during school time,\" he said.",
      "He said the UK should consider following in Australia's steps with a social media ban for under-16s, adding: \"We have to view the online world, social media and mobile phones in the same prism as we view the tobacco companies. These are harmful to our young people and they need regulating.\"",

    "summary": "The UK government sought to keep details of its row with Apple over requested access to its encrypted cloud storage tool private.",
    "story": [
      "A judge has sided with a coalition of civil liberties groups and news organisations - including the BBC - and ruled a legal row between the UK government and Apple over data privacy cannot be held in secret.",
      "The Home Office wants the right to be able access information secured by Apple's Advanced Data Protection (ADP) system, citing powers given to it under the Investigatory Powers Act.",
      "At the moment Apple has no such capability - such data can only be accessed by the user - and says it does not want to create what it calls a \"backdoor\" into ADP because of concerns it would eventually be exploited by hackers and criminals.",
      "The government's request prompted fierce criticism from privacy campaigners and some US politicians.",
      "In February, Apple pulled ADP from the UK and in March it launched legal proceedings against the government, in a case which is being heard by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal.",
      "The government argued it would damage national security if the nature of the legal action and the parties to it were made public - what are known as the \"bare details of the case\".",
      "In a ruling published on Monday morning, the tribunal rejected that request - pointing to the extensive media reporting of the row and highlighting the legal principle of open justice.",
      "\"It would have been a truly extraordinary step to conduct a hearing entirely in secret without any public revelation of the fact that a hearing was taking place,\" it states.",
      "\"For the reasons that are set out in our private judgement, we do not accept that the revelation of the bare details of the case would be damaging to the public interest or prejudicial to national security,\" it later adds.",
      "In a statement the Home Office said it would not comment on legal proceedings or individual notices but said its \"first priority is to keep people safe.\"",
      "\"There are longstanding and targeted investigatory powers that allow the authorities to investigate terrorists, paedophiles and the most serious criminals and they are subject to robust safeguards including judicial authorisations and oversight to protect people's privacy,\" it added.",
      "It stressed it was not seeking blanket data access - and any requests to view individual accounts protected by ADP would need a court approved warrant.",
      "Wider implications",
      "Civil and digital rights organisations in the UK, which criticised the Home Office request, have welcomed Monday's ruling.",
      "They, along with news organisations  - including the BBC - made legal representations for the case to be heard in public.",
      "\"This is bigger than the UK and Apple,\" said Jim Killock, executive director of Open Rights Group.",
      "\"The Court's judgment will have implications for the privacy and security of millions of people around the world.\"",
      "The Open Rights Group campaigned alongside Big Brother Watch and Index on Censorship against the proposal to hold the hearing in secret.",
      "Big Brother Watch interim director Rebecca Vincent says the judgement is \"effectively chipping away at the pervasive climate of secrecy surrounding the Investigatory Powers Tribunal's consideration of the Apple case\".",
      "\"The Home Office's order to break encryption represents a massive attack on the privacy rights of millions of British Apple users, which is a matter of significant public interest and must not be considered behind closed doors,\" she adds.",
      "Apple declined to comment.",
      "In a previous statement it told the BBC:  \"Apple remains committed to offering our users the highest level of security for their personal data and are hopeful that we will be able to do so in the future in the United Kingdom.",
      "\"As we have said many times before we have never built a backdoor or master key to any of our products or services and we never will.\"",
      "How does ADP work?",
      "ADP is an opt-in data security tool designed to provide users of devices such as iPhones with a more secure way to protect data such as photos and notes stored in their iCloud accounts.",
      "It uses what is known as end-to-end encryption (E2EE), meaning only the user has the \"key\" necessary to unscramble and access the data.",
      "E2EE is also used to protect data on messaging services including WhatsApp and Signal.",
      "It makes the data very secure - but poses a problem for law enforcement agencies.",
      "They can request to view information stored with lower levels of protection - but companies such as Apple have no way of allowing them to view files secured with E2EE because they do not possess such a capability.",
      "Campaign group Privacy International said the right of individuals also needed to be protected - and welcomed today's ruling.",
      "\"Executive decisions affecting the privacy and security of billions of people globally should be open to legal challenge in the most transparent way possible\", it said.",

      "He said that could be a real blow for the people who sell the physical games.",
      "\"When a Nintendo Switch game releases, around 80% of its sales are in a box - if you compare that to Xbox, around 80% of new game sales are digital.",
      "\"By charging more for the physical copy it's going to encourage people to download more, which will be good for Nintendo's bottom line.\"",
      "But of course it will be worse for the retailers who miss out on sales of the physical game.",
      "The price of failure",
      "One thing Nintendo will be hoping to avoid replicating is the disastrous launch of its handheld 3DS in 2011.",
      "It came hot off the heels of the DS, the best-selling handheld in history, with fans seemingly desperate for an upgrade.",
      "But the price tag of over \u00a3200 - more than double that of the original handheld - sparked consternation amongst fans who weren't willing to shell out so much for it.",
      "Within six months, Nintendo had slashed the price by almost half, and over time it picked up traction.",
      "It is fair to say the 3DS faced other problems such as a lacklustre list of launch games, whereas the Switch 2 is launching with the first Mario Kart game in a decade.",
      "Nonetheless Nintendo has form with price decisions backfiring.",
      "The N64 launched at \u00a3250 back in 1997, and within a year it had tumbled down to \u00a399.",

      "Nintendo confirmed the announcement applies to the US market only, so UK pre-orders will not be affected.",
      "Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries.",

    "summary": "India wants to boost the domestic trainer industry but will small domestic makers suffer?",
    "story": [
      "It's likely that you have not heard of Taiwan's Hong Fu Industrial Group, but look down on a busy street and you may well see its products.",
      "Hong Fu is the world's second-biggest maker of trainers (sneakers) supplying shoes to Nike, Converse, Adidas, Puma and many others. It makes around 200 million pairs of sports shoes a year.",
      "So when it made a big investment in India's market, the footwear industry took note.",
      "Hong Fu is currently building a giant plant in Panapakkam, in the state of Tamil Nadu in south eastern India. When fully operational, some time in the next three to five years, it will make 25 million pairs of shoes a year, employing as many as 25,000 workers.",
      "The project has Indian partners, including Aqeel Panaruna, the chairman of Florence Shoe Company: \"The international market is saturated and they [Hong Fu] were looking for a new market,\" he explains.",
      "\"There is a drastic increase in non-leather footwear in India. It has huge potential,\" Mr Panaruna added.",
      "The Indian government is keen to attract such investment, hoping it will raise standards in the footwear industry and boost exports.",
      "To spur the industry, last August the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) introduced new quality rules for all shoes sold in India.",
      "Under those standards, for example, materials will have to pass tests of strength and flexibility.",
      "\"These BIS standards are really about cleaning up the market. We've had too many low-quality products flooding in, and consumers deserve better,\" says Sandeep Sharma a journalist and footwear industry expert.",
      "But many in India can't afford shoes from well-known brands.",
      "Serving them is a huge and intricate network of small shoe makers, known as the unorganised sector.",
      "Their affordable products are estimated to account for two-thirds of the total footwear market.",
      "Ashok (he withheld his full name) counts himself as part of that sector, with shoe making units all across the district of Agra in northern India. He estimates that 200,0000 pairs of shoes are made everyday by operations like his across Agra.",
      "\"Many consumers, especially in rural and lower-income urban areas, opt for cheaper local footwear instead of branded options,\" he says.",
      "\"Many organised brands struggle to expand their retail footprint in semi-urban and rural areas because we cater to them.\"",
      "So how will the new government standards affect makers like Ashok?",
      "\"It's complicated,\" says Mr Sharma.",
      "\"I think the government is trying to walk a tightrope here. They can't just shut down thousands of small businesses that employ millions of people - that would be economic suicide.",
      "\"What I'm seeing is more of a carrot-and-stick approach. They're pushing for standards, but also rolling out programs to help small manufacturers upgrade their processes. It's not about wiping out the unorganised sector but gradually bringing them into the fold.\"",
      "Making the situation more complicated is that the unorganised sector is well-known for making counterfeit shoes of big brands.",
      "While popular among Indian shoppers looking for a stylish bargain, other countries have long-complained about the losses caused.",
      "Meanwhile, a host of new Indian trainer-makers are springing up, to serve India's growing middle class.",
      "Sabhib Agrawal is trying to get those buyers interested in barefoot footwear - shoes which, their makers say, are healthy for the foot as they encourage natural, or barefoot, movement.",
      "Mr Agrawal says his company, Zen Barefoot, is unusual as much of the Indian footwear industry is not very innovative.",
      "\"There are very few people who are ready to take time and invest in new technologies here. Indian manufacturing is a very profit- first market, ROI [return on investment] driven.",
      "\"And in a lot of cases, even the government is not ready to enable these industries through grants or tax relief, which makes it quite difficult.\"",
      "Comet is one Indian firm looking to innovate.",
      "It claims to be the first homegrown trainer brand that owns the whole production process, from design to manufacturing.",
      "\"This level of control allows us to experiment with materials, introduce innovative silhouettes, and continuously refine comfort and fit based on real feedback,\" says founder Utkarsh Gupta.",
      "He says the Comet shoes are adapted to India's climate and roads.",
      "\"Most homegrown brands rely on off-the-shelf soles from the market, but when we started Comet, we realized that these were lacking in quality, durability, and grip,\" he says.",
      "Change is coming to the footwear sector he says. \"The shift to high value is now happening.\"",
      "\"Many high value brands need to move their manufacturing to India. In 3-5 years, we should have a robust ecosystem to compete in the international sneaker market,\" he adds.",
      "Back in Agra, Ashok hopes that the unorganised sector is not neglected amid the growth of India's footwear industry.",
      "\"The government should give us accreditation and certificates so our factories don't close down. Once we too are included in the organised sector no one can beat India in the shoe manufacturing industry.\"",
      "But Mr Sharma says change is inevitable.",
      "\"The market is definitely going to shift. We'll see the bigger players getting bigger - they have the money to adapt quickly.",
      "\"But I don't think the small guys will disappear completely. The smart ones will find their niche.\"",

And alongside them, scores of merengue music-lovers and P\u00e9rez fans also died in the collapse.",
      "For as long as there is a feasible chance of success, the authorities' focus remains on the search and rescue operation. However, eventually the questions will turn to the cause of the collapse and government investigators will have to provide meaningful answers to the families in due course.",
      "One theory is already circulating outside the venue. Many are pointing the finger of blame at a fire at the nightclub around two years ago. Some fear the blaze structurally weakened the site or that any repairs carried out were insufficient or not up to code.",
      "The owner of the Jet Set nightclub, Antonio Espaillat, delivered a video message via social media expressing his condolences and those of \"all the Jet Set family\", to the victims' relatives.",

      "The additional tariff on Beijing, he said, would be effective immediately. \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realise that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,\" he wrote.",
      "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent insisted the change of policy had not been influenced by the global falls, but senior Democrat Chuck Schumer said the decision showed Trump was \"reeling and retreating\".",

      "\"I did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate because I told them 'if you retaliate, we're going to double it' - and that's what I did with China,\" he said, adding that he thought, \"It's all going to work out amazing.\"",

      "In response, Trump threatened an additional 50%, bringing the total to 104% on Tuesday, if Beijing did not back down. China did not change course and said it would \"fight to the end\" if the US \"insists on provoking a tariff war or trade war\".",

      "They called for the protection of civilians, the facilitation of aid deliveries, the release of the hostages held by Hamas, and the renewal of the ceasefire.",

    "summary": "Details of the repatriation are not known but it comes amid talks about a mineral deal between the two countries.",
    "story": [
      "Three Americans convicted for their role in a failed coup in Democratic Republic of Congo last year have been sent home to the US to serve the rest of their jail terms.",
      "The three were originally sentenced to death by a military court before their sentences were commuted to life in prison last week.",
      "US Department of State spokesperson Tammy Bruce said the three were \"in our custody\".",
      "The repatriation comes as the US and DR Congo explore a deal to exploit the central African country's huge mineral wealth.",
      "Last week, US President Donald Trump's senior adviser for Africa visited DR Congo and confirmed that the two countries were in talks about minerals and said it could involve \"multibillion-dollar investments\".",
      "DR Congo has large deposits of coltan and cobalt, used in electronic equipment and batteries for electric cars, which are currently largely extracted by Chinese mining companies.",
      "The three American convicts - Marcel Malanga Malu, Tylor Thomson and Zalman Polun Benjamin - left DR Congo on Tuesday to serve the remainder of their sentences in the US, said Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama.",
      "They were escorted to N'Djili International Airport in Kinshasa in \"strict compliance with legal procedures\", said DR Congo's presidency.",
      "The transfer \"is part of a dynamic of strengthening judicial diplomacy and international cooperation in matters of justice and human rights\" between DR Congo and the US, the presidency added.",
      "The Americans were among 37 people sentenced to death last September by a military court.",
      "Jean-Jacques Wondo, a dual Congolese and Belgian citizen who was also sentenced to death, was in February transferred to Belgium because of ill-health.",
      "It is not clear if the other convicts, who include a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian national, will also have their sentences commuted.",
      "They were accused of leading an attack on both the presidential palace and the home of an ally of President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi last May. Later they were convicted of criminal conspiracy, terrorism and other charges, which they denied.",
      "The suspected leader of the plot, Christian Malanga, a US national of Congolese origin, was killed during the attack, along with five others. Hi son, Marcel Malanga Malu, is among those sent home on Tuesday.",
      "Details of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear but the State Department said it was aware of the repatriation done in collaboration with the US embassy in Kinshasa, the DR Congo capital.",
      "But legal experts say it's unlikely the US will release them or shorten their sentences, reports the AP news agency.",
      "The Department of State spokesperson said that the US condemned the armed attacks and supported DR Congo's bid to hold the convicts accountable, but she also sought \"consistent, compassionate, humane treatment and a fair legal process\".",
      "Joseph Szlavik-Soto, a lobbyist working for the Congolese government, told Reuters news agency that it had agreed to pay for the damage caused by protesters who attacked the US embassy and other missions earlier this year. The US officials are yet to comment on the matter.",

    "summary": "Four people died and six were seriously injured when two helicopters collided on the Gold Coast in 2023.",
    "story": [
      "A faulty radio antenna contributed to a deadly mid-air helicopter collision at an Australian theme park and resort, transport safety officials say.",
      "Four people died - including two British tourists - and several more were seriously injured when the two aircraft hit each other in January 2023, near Sea World on the Gold Coast.",
      "An investigation by Australia's Transport and Safety Bureau (ATSB) found one of the pilots did not hear a vital radio call shortly before the accident, and that a series of changes by Sea World meant risk controls were over time eroded.",
      "The accident rocked the Gold Coast, one of the nation's biggest tourist hotspots.",
      "The two helicopters collided around 20 seconds after one had taken off and as the other was landing.",
      "Those who died were all travelling in the helicopter which was taking off. The other aircraft managed to make an emergency landing, with passengers suffering a range of injuries.",
      "The ATSB report found that in the months leading up to the accident, Sea World had tried to improve its offering of leisure flights by adding a second helipad location and introducing larger Eurocopter EC140 B4 helicopters.",
      "\"Over time, these changes undermined risk controls used to manage traffic separation and created a conflict point between... helicopters,\" it said.",
      "The aircraft preparing to take off also had a faulty antenna.",
      "In the run-up to the collision, a call from the arriving helicopter was either not received or not heard by the pilot on the ground, who was loading passengers at the time.",
      "However, once the passengers were on board, a ground crew member advised the departing helicopter pilot that the airspace was clear. By the time the chopper took off, though, that information was no longer correct.",
      "Meanwhile the pilot who was wanting to land after a five-minute scenic flight had seen the other helicopter on the ground but didn't deem it a threat, the report said.",
      "He would have expected to have been alerted by a \"taxiing\" radio call if that situation changed. However the faulty antenna likely prevented the broadcast of the taxiing call, the report said.",
      "\"Without the taxiing call being received, the pilot of the inbound helicopter, who was likely focusing on their landing site, had no trigger to reassess the status of the departing helicopter as a collision risk.\"",
      "Among those who died were Diane Hughes, 57, and her 65-year-old husband Ron who were from Neston, Cheshire. They had married in 2022 and were on holiday visiting relatives after being separated by COVID.",
      "The \"fun-loving\" couple from Neston, Cheshire, had \"a zest for life\", their family said in a statement at the time.",
      "Also killed was Sydney resident Vanessa Tadros, 36, and 40-year-old Sea World Helicopters pilot Ashley Jenkinson, who was originally from Birmingham.",
      "A further six people were seriously injured while three others sustained minor injuries in the crash.",
      "Shortly after the accident, the passengers on the flight that was returning hailed the pilot as a \"hero\" for landing the helicopter safely.",
      "In all, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau made 28 findings that underline \"key lessons\" for operators and pilots.",
      "\"The most fundamental lesson from this investigation is that making changes to aviation operations, even those that appear to increase safety, can have unintended consequences,\" ATSB Chief Commissioner Angus Mitchell said.",
      "\"It is therefore critical that changes to aviation operations are managed through the implementation of a defined process to ensure overall safety is not adversely affected.\""

      "District Judge Trevor McFadden on Tuesday said the administration's restriction on AP journalists was \"contrary to the First Amendment\", which guarantees freedom of speech.",
      "The dispute arose when the AP refused to adopt the administration's renaming of the Gulf of Mexico to the \"Gulf of America\" in its coverage, following an executive order by President Donald Trump.",

      "The AP had argued that the administration violated the news agency's  constitutional right to free speech by restricting access due to disagreements over  language.",
      "In February, Judge McFadden had declined to immediately restore its access to presidential events.",
      "After Tuesday's ruling, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton said the agency was \"gratified by the court's decision\".",
      "\"Today's ruling affirms the fundamental right of the press and public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a freedom guaranteed for all Americans in the US Constitution,\" she said in a statement.",
      "Shortly after the judge's ruling, though, two AP journalists were turned away from covering an event that Trump attended on Tuesday night, the agency reported in an update on Wednesday.",
      "A photographer and reporter were blocked from blocked from joining Trump's motorcade that was traveling to a dinner held by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the agency reported.",
      "The ruling was also welcomed by other organisations who had criticised the  initial restrictions on the AP.",
      "\"This is a careful, well-reasoned opinion that properly describes the exclusion of the Associated Press from the press pool as retaliatory, viewpoint-based, and unconstitutional,\" said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University.",

      "The Trump administration argued that the Associated Press was not entitled to \"special access\" to the president.",

Under his watch, the Federal Communications Commission has also opened lawsuits against the major networks ABC, CBS and NBC.",

      "The overwhelming favourite in the race on Saturday is the man who led that peaceful putsch and has dominated the political scene ever since, Brice Clotaire Oligui Nguema.",
      "Having abandoned his soldier's fatigues and military status in favour of a politician's suit, this highly articulate former commander of the elite Republican Guard faces seven other candidates.",
      "Basking in popularity among a population relieved to be rid of dynastic rule - and assisted by electoral regulations that disqualified some key challengers - the 50-year-old appears almost certain to secure an outright majority in the first ballot.",
      "His campaign slogan - using his initials \"C'BON\" - is a play on the French words \"c'est bon\", meaning \"it's good\".",
      "His chances of avoiding a second round run-off are bolstered by the fact that his main challenger - one of the rare senior political or civil society figures not to have rallied to his cause - is the old regime's last prime minister, Alain-Claude Bilie-By-Nze, known by his initials ACBBN.",
      "Victory will bring a seven-year mandate and the resources to implement development and modernising reform at a pace that the rulers of crisis-beset African countries could not even dream of.",
      "With only 2.5 million people, Gabon is an established oil producer and the world's second-largest exporter of manganese.",
      "Its territory, which sits astride the equator, encompasses some of the most biodiverse tracts of the Congo Basin rainforest.",
      "And other than a harsh post-election crackdown in the capital, Libreville, in 2016, the country has enjoyed a mostly calm recent history that contrasts with the conflicts and instability that have afflicted many regional neighbours.",
      "Oligui Nguema and his Republican Guards met no resistance when they seized power on 30 August 2023, just hours after the electoral authorities had taken to the airwaves in the middle of the night to proclaim that the incumbent President, Ali Bongo Ondimba, had secured a third seven-year term with a crushing 64% of the vote.",
      "It was hard to see this official result as credible. Ali Bongo, who succeeded his father Omar in 2009, had only squeaked a narrow and much disputed victory in the previous poll, in 2016.",
      "When he suffered a stroke while visiting Saudi Arabia two years later and embarked on a painstaking gradual recovery there had been widespread popular sympathy.",
      "But the mood shifted after he decided to stand for a third term, despite his visibly frail state of health - this fuelled widespread resentment at the supposed behind-the-throne influence and ambitions of his French-born wife Sylvia and his son Nourredin Bongo Valentin.",
      "The military's peaceful intervention to forestall a continuation of the regime, arresting Sylvia and Nourredin and confining Ali in enforced retirement in his private villa, triggered spontaneous celebrations among the many Gabonese who had grown weary of this apparently immovable dynasty.",
      "And the coup was greeted with relief even by most of the administrative, political and civil society elite.",

      "Political detainees were freed, though Ali Bongo's wife and son remain in detention awaiting trial on corruption charges.",
      "He did not resort to the sort of crackdowns on dissent or media freedom that have become a routine tool of Francophone Africa's other military leaders, in Mali, Guinea, Burkina Faso and Niger.",
      "On the diplomatic front, in marked contrast to the assertively anti-Western posture adopted by the regimes in West Africa, Oligui Nguema despatched senior figures to cultivate international goodwill and reassure Gabon's traditional partners of his determination to restore civilian constitutional government within a tightly limited timeframe.",
      "Relations with France, the former colonial power and previously a close ally of the Bongo regime, are warm.",
      "The two governments recently agreed to transform Camp de Gaulle, the longstanding French base in Gabon, into a new training centre that they will operate jointly.",
      "Displaying a deft popular and political touch, Oligui Nguema has responded to public hunger for change with an acceleration of public works and delayed projects.",
      "And at a time of rising popular support across Francophone Africa for a more visibly assertive defence of national interests, his government has acquired the Gabonese assets of several foreign oil companies, including the UK's Tullow.",

    "summary": "There is much more to this than straightforward retaliation, writes John Sudworth, and it traces back to his first term.",
    "story": [
      "Suddenly, Donald Trump's trade war is in much sharper focus.",
      "Rather than a fight on all fronts against the world, this now looks far more like a fight on familiar Trumpian territory: America v China.",
      "The 90-day pause on the higher \"retaliatory\" tariffs levied on dozens of countries still leaves a universal across-the-board tariff of 10% in place.",
      "But China \u2013 which ships everything from iPhones to children's toys and accounts for around 14% of all US imports \u2013 has been singled out for much harsher treatment with an eye-watering rate of 125%.",
      "Trump said the increase was due to Beijing's readiness to retaliate with its own 84% levy on US goods, a move the president described as showing a \"lack of respect\".",
      "But for a politician who first fought his way to the White House on the back of an anti-China message, there is much more to this than simple retaliation.",
      "For Trump, this is about the unfinished business of that first term in office.",
      "\"We didn't have the time to do the right thing, which we're doing now,\" he told reporters.",
      "The aim is nothing less than the upending of an established system of global trade centred on China as the factory of the world, as well as the once widely held view that underpinned it \u2013 the idea that more of this trade was, in and of itself, a good thing.",
      "To understand just how central this is to the US president's thinking, you need to go back to the time before anyone ever thought of him as a possible candidate for office, let alone a likely winner.",
      "In 2012, when I first reported from Shanghai - China's business capital - increased trade with the country was seen by almost everyone \u2013 global business leaders, Chinese officials, visiting foreign governments and trade delegations, foreign correspondents and learned economists \u2013 as a no brainer.",
      "It was boosting global growth, providing an endless supply of cheap goods, enriching China's army of new factory workers increasingly embedded in global supply chains, and providing lucrative opportunities to multinational corporations selling their wares to its newly minted middle classes.",
      "Within a few of years of my arrival, China had surpassed the US to become the world's biggest market for Rolls Royce, General Motors and Volkswagen.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?US pauses higher tariffs for most countries but hits China harderTrump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "US pauses higher tariffs for most countries but hits China harder",
      "Trump steps back from cliff edge of all-out global trade war",
      "There was a deeper justification, too.",
      "As China got richer, so the theory went, Chinese people would begin to demand political reform.",
      "Their spending habits would also help China transition to a consumer society.",
      "But the first of those aspirations never happened, with China's ruling Communist Party only tightening its grip on power.",
      "And the second one didn't happen fast enough, with China not only still dependent on exports, but openly planning to become ever more dominant.",
      "Its infamous policy blueprint - published in 2015 and entitled Made in China 2025 - set out a huge state-backed vision of becoming a global leader in a number of key manufacturing sectors, from aerospace to ship building to electric vehicles.",
      "And so it was that just one year later, a complete political unknown began an outsider-run for US president, making the case repeatedly on the campaign trail that China's rise had hollowed out the American economy, driven rustbelt decline and cost blue-collar workers their livelihoods and dignity.",
      "Trump's first-term trade war broke the mould and shattered the consensus. His successor, President Joe Biden, kept much of his tariffs on China in place.",
      "And yet, even though they have undoubtedly caused China some pain, they have not done much to change the economic model.",
      "China now produces 60% of the world's electric cars \u2013 a large proportion of them made by its own homegrown brands - and 80% of the batteries that power them.",
      "So, now Trump is back, with this tit-for-tat escalation on levies.",
      "It would, arguably, be the biggest shock ever delivered to the established global trading system, were it not for all the other on-again off-again tariff measures the US president has rolled out in recent days.",
      "What happens next depends on two key questions.",
      "Firstly, whether China takes up that offer to negotiate.",
      "And secondly, assuming it eventually does, whether China is willing to make the kind of major concessions that America is looking for, including a complete overhaul of its export driven economic model.",
      "In answering them, the first thing to say is that we are in completely unchartered territory, so we should be wary of anyone who says they know how Beijing is likely to react.",
      "But there are certainly reasons to be cautious.",
      "China's vision of its economic strength - one based on strong exports and a tightly protected domestic market - is now closely bound up with its idea of national rejuvenation and the supremacy of its one-party system.",
      "Its tight control over the information sphere means it will be unlikely to drop its barriers to American technology companies, for example.",
      "But there is a third question, and it is one for America to answer.",
      "Does the US still believe in free trade? Donald Trump often suggests that tariffs are a good thing, not merely as a means to an end, but as an end in themselves.",
      "He talks about the benefit of a protectionist barrier for America, in order to stimulate domestic investment, encourage American companies to bring those foreign supply chains back home, and raise tax revenues.",
      "And if Beijing believes that is indeed the primary purpose of the tariffs, it may decide there is nothing to negotiate anyway.",
      "Rather than championing the idea of economic co-operation, the world's two biggest superpowers may find themselves locked in a fight for winner-takes-all economic supremacy.",
      "If so, that really would mark a shattering of the old consensus, and a very different, possibly very dangerous, future."

    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 21:28:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Online apps are posing a threat to physical stores, but their presence so far is limited to big cities.",
    "story": [
      "The corner shop Ramji Dharod has manned for over six decades is now on the brink of closure.",
      "The store sits in a bylane in the central Indian city of Mumbai's busy shopping precinct, and has served the community for 75 years.",
      "Dharod began coming to the shop with his father when he was just 10. These days, he mostly sits idle, waiting for an occasional customer to walk in.",
      "Behind him, cardboard boxes of unsold biscuit packets and snacks show a \"stock clearance sale\" sign posted on them.",
      "\"I wouldn't get a minute to breathe a few years ago, but now I rarely get anyone coming,\" says the septuagenarian wryly. \"They are all shopping online. I've decided to retire and down the shutters.\"",
      "As 10-minute online deliveries by \"quick commerce\" apps like Zomato, BlinkIt and Zepto pervade urban India, hundreds of thousands of neighbourhood stores across cities have closed down.",
      "A lobby group of consumer product distributors estimated that number to be 200,000 last October, while the municipal body of the southern city of Chennai estimated 20% of small grocers and 30% of larger departmental stores had shut down in the city in the past 5 years.",
      "Sunil Kenia who runs a provision store right beside Dharod's shop says he's still in business only because his family owns the shop. Those on rent are no longer able to stay afloat, he says.",
      "\"It started going downhill after the Covid lockdowns. Business is at 50% of what we did before the pandemic,\" Kenia told the BBC.",
      "Most of his revenue now comes from wholesale customers \u2013 hawkers or those selling street-side snacks. The retail customer has all but \"vanished\", he says, because of the convenience of mobile deliveries.",
      "Mumbai-based graphic designer Monisha Sathe is among the millions of urban Indians who've stopped their weekly run to the market because of the ease of quick commerce.",
      "\"Lugging groceries back home was a big pain,\" says Sathe. And occasionally, when she took out her car, navigating narrow market lanes and finding a parking slot would be a challenge.",
      "Sathe says she misses the human interaction she had with the grocers and vegetable vendors and even the variety of fresh produce on sale \u2013 but for her, the balance still tilts in favour of online deliveries because of how much easier it has made her life.",
      "A recent survey by consultancy PwC shows some 42% of urban consumers in India's big cities think like Sathe, especially preferring quick delivery for their urgent needs. And these shifts in buying behaviour have led to three out of 10 retailers reporting a negative impact on their business, with a 52% drop in essential goods sales.",
      "But to what extent is quick commerce really hollowing out the Indian high street?",
      "There's no doubt general trade \u2013 which includes grocery stores, corner shops and even big retail outlets \u2013 has come under threat, says Ankur Bisen, a partner at Technopak retail advisory. But at least for now \"quick commerce is still a three-four city story\", he says. Nearly all of their sales come from these cities.",
      "Lightning fast deliveries bucked the global trend and became successful in India largely due to a large concentration of people staying in urban clusters.",
      "They are serviced through low-rent \"dark stores\" - or small shops dedicated to delivery and not open to the public - in densely populated areas, enabling economies of scale.",
      "But the precarious nature of demand and fragmented demographics of smaller towns could make it expensive for quick commerce players to expand and make money beyond the metros, says Mr Bisen.",
      "There's little doubt though that these online deliveries will disrupt trade in the longer run.",
      "Bain and Company expects quick commerce to grow at over 40% annually through to 2030, driven by expansion across \"geographies\".",
      "And this has made traditional retail nervous.",
      "Trade organisations - like the Confederation of All India Traders, or the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation which calls itself the voice of India's 13m retailers - have made urgent and repeated pleas to the government against this breakneck expansion.",
      "They allege that these companies are using billions of dollars in venture capital funds to engage in anti-competitive practices like \"predatory pricing\" or \"deep discounting\" which has further distorted the playing field for mom-and-pop shops.",
      "The BBC spoke to several small retailers who shared these concerns. Mr Bisen too agreed there's evidence of such practices in the clusters that quick commerce companies operate.",
      "Swiggy, Zepto and Blinkit, who primarily control this market, did not agree to comment on the BBC's queries on these allegations.",
      "But a source within one of the quick commerce companies told the BBC the discounting was done by traders on the platform and not by them.",
      "The source also said that contrary to the binary narrative of the \"big guy versus small guy\", online deliveries were solving real-world challenges for people for whom going to the market was a \"traumatic\" experience.",
      "\"Think of women or senior citizens - they don't want to be harassed or navigate potholes and traffic,\" the source said. \"Also consider the small brands that sell on our platform - they never get shelf space in physical shops where only the big names are displayed. We've democratised the market.\"",
      "Analysts say, the sheer diversity of India in terms of its stages of development, levels of income and infrastructure will mean that in the end all retail models - small corner shops, organised big retailers and quick commerce platforms - will cohabit in the country.",
      "This is not a \"winner takes all market\", says Mr Bisen, giving the example of e-commerce which came into India in 2010 and was meant to sound the death knell of local retailers.",
      "Even after all these years, only 4% of all shopping is done online in India.",
      "But the ripples caused by quick commerce should be a warning for physical retailers, say analysts, to improve their marketing and integrate technology to use both online and offline channels to give their consumers a better shopping experience.",
      "Competing with click-of-a-button delivery means it can no longer be business as usual for the millions of corner shops who've existed for decades, with little or no innovation.",

      "For days, Donald Trump and his White House team had insisted they were fully committed to their decision to impose sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries. They even derided a report on Tuesday that said the president was considering a 90-day pause \u2013 news that triggered a brief stock market surge.",
      "But now that pause on higher tariff rates, with a few notable exceptions, is a reality. The reordering of the global economic order is on hold, and Trump's promise of a golden age of American manufacturing will have to wait.",
      "The White House has said that going big on tariffs and then hitting the pause button, before entering negotiations with individual countries, was the plan all along.",
      "\"We've had more than 75 countries contact us, and I imagine, after today, there will be more,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters shortly after the announcement.",
      "That framing from the White House is not surprising, of course. And it is difficult to ignore the investor panic, tumbling bond market and growing chorus of Republican criticism and public disapproval that preceded the announcement.",
      "So was it a strategic retreat in the face of unexpected resistance, or yet another example of Trump's \"art of the deal\" negotiating strategy at work?",

Were Mexico and Canada, which had avoided the original 10% baseline tariffs, somehow now get included? Were tariffs targeting specific sectors affected?",
      "Ultimately, the White House provided some clarity on these questions \u2013 but for hours US trading partners were left to scrutinise Trump's Truth Social post and glean details from answers to questions shouted by reporters at press gaggles.",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, Trump acknowledged that the markets had looked \"pretty glum\" and that \"people were getting a little queasy\" \u2013 a reflection that undercut some of the bravado he expressed over the past week and could hint at the real reason for his tariff change of course.",
      "Earlier in the day, he was on Truth Social, urging people to \"BE COOL!\" and promising that \"everything is going to work out\". And on Monday he lashed out at what he called \"panicans\" - a party based on \"weak and stupid people\" who weren't patient with his efforts.",
      "In the end, however, it was Trump who made an abrupt change of course.",
      "He insisted, however, that his tariff announcement was one that had to be made, and that any economic disruptions reflected a sickness that had been allowed to fester in the American economy.",
      "Democrats, meanwhile, painted a less rosy picture. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of \"governing by chaos\".",
      "\"He is reeling, he is retreating, and that is a good thing,\" he said.",
      "In the end, the thought process behind Trump's decision may not really matter.",
      "The reality is that the US is now making nice \u2013 or at least nicer - with nations that had faced their retaliatory trade fire, even though Trump is still imposing a 10% across the board tariff that by itself would have been huge news just a few weeks ago.",
      "It is enough of a step down for the stock market to bounce back, however, and Trump is now leaning into a trade war with China which he hit with 125% tariffs.",

    "story": [
      "It sounds like something from a science fiction movie, but Stephen Eisele is confident that one day his company will open a data centre on the Moon.",
      "\"The way we see it is that by putting the data centre in space, you're really offering unparalleled security,\" says the president of Lonestar Data Holdings.",
      "Last month, the Florida-based firm claimed to have successfully tested a tiny data centre the size of a hardback book that hitched a ride to the Moon on the Athena Lunar Lander from US space exploration firm Intuitive Machines. This, in turn, had been launched by a rocket from Elon Musk's SpaceX.",
      "Data centres are the vast warehouses that house stacks of computers that store and process data used by websites, companies and governments.",
      "Lonestar says that putting them on the Moon will offer customers secure, reliable data processing, while taking advantage of unlimited solar energy to power them.",
      "The environmental campaigners fighting against data centres",
      "Data centre power use 'to surge six-fold in 10 years'",
      "Concern UK's AI ambitions could lead to water shortages",
      "And while space-based data centres may sound far-fetched, it's an idea that's really starting to take off.",
      "Part of the reason is rocketing demand and the difficulty of finding suitable sites on Earth.",
      "The ever-expanding use of artificial intelligence (AI) computing has seen a massive increase in the amount of data that needs to be stored and processed around the world.",
      "As a result, the need for data centres has shot up too, with annual demand set to rise between 19% and 22% by 2030, according to global management consultants McKinsey.",
      "New facilities are springing up all the time - but it's getting hard to find places to put them. Data centres are large and sprawling, and use enormous amounts of power and water for cooling.",
      "And increasingly local people don't want them built nearby.",
      "Putting data centres in space \u2013 either in orbit around Earth, or on the Moon - the theory goes, means they can't do quite so much harm. There's more-or-less unlimited energy available from the sun, for example, and no neighbours to complain about the environmental impacts.",
      "Not only that, space-based data centres could specialise in services for spacecraft and other space facilities, with space-to-space data transfers quicker than from the ground.",
      "Last summer, a European Commission-funded feasibility study into orbiting data centres published its results.",
      "The Ascend report by carried out by Thales Alenia Space - a joint venture between French and Italian aerospace groups Thales and Leonardo - published its results.",
      "It determined that deploying data centres in space \"could transform the European digital landscape\", and be \"more eco-friendly\".",
      "Thales Alenia Space envisages building a constellation of 13 satellites measuring  a combined 200m-by-80m, and with a total data processing power of around 10 megawatts (MW). That's equivalent to a current medium-sized, ground-based data centre, with some 5,000 servers.",
      "Based on technologies that already exist or are under development, the satellites would be assembled in orbit.",
      "Damien Dumestier, Ascend project architect at Thales Alenia Space, says that for space-based data centres to be more environmentally friendly than existing ground-based ones it will be necessary to make the rocket launchers 10 times less emissive over their lifecycles. He says this looks possible.",
      "\"But in order to cover the new technology's developments and the production capacity ramp-up to benefit from scale, we have to consider larger system capacity, around 200MW, meaning 200 of our envisaged large space infrastructures and 200 launches,\" he says.",
      "\"The main question is when an adapted launcher will be ready. Depending on the investment and decisions to be taken, this could be done for 2030 or 2035, meaning commercial viability before 2037.\"",
      "However, despite this optimism from firms aiming to develop the technology, Dr Domenico Vicinanza, associate professor of intelligent systems and data science at Anglia Ruskin University in the UK, says there are numerous big hurdles before space-based data centres can be a viable proposition.",
      "\"Even with the contribution and advancements of companies like SpaceX, launching hardware into orbit remains extremely expensive,\" he says. \"Each kilogram sent into space costs thousands of dollars.",
      "\"Space-based data centres would require not only the data equipment but also the infrastructure to protect, power, and cool them. All of which add up in weight and complexity.\"",
      "Cooling the equipment will be a particular problem,  because even though space is cold, conventional cooling systems don't work will without gravity.",
      "Meanwhile, space weather can damage electronics, while the ever-increasing quantity of space debris puts the physical hardware at risk.",
      "Dr Vicinanza adds: \"And fixing problems in orbit is far from straightforward. Even with robotics and automation, there are limits to what can be repaired remotely.",
      "\"A big hardware failure might necessitate a costly human mission, potentially making downtime stretch for weeks or months.\"",
      "Yet firms like Lonestar are supremely confident, and say that they are responding to demand. \"We wouldn't be doing this if the customers weren't asking us to,\" says Mr Scott.",
      "Its next target is to put a small data centre in orbit around the moon in 2027. Meanwhile, other companies are hoping to get there a bit faster, such as Washington state-based Starcloud, which is due to launch a satellite-based data centre next month, and start commercial operations in mid-2026.",
      "Lonestar's Mr Eidele says that space-based facilities offer more security for governments and businesses because their data does not need to be routed through terrestrial networks. Instead the information can be beamed directly from space to a dedicated ground station.",
      "\"It's like having the vaults at the back of the bank,\" he says. \"You don't have to open it every day, but it's there to provide an extra measure of security, and the distance from the Earth to the moon offers that - it's that much harder to hack, that much harder to access.\"",
      "The distance to the Moon means that data takes about a second and a half to reach the ground - this doesn't matter for some applications, like longer-term data storage and backups.",
      "And meanwhile, says Lonestar founder and chief executive Chris Stott, space-based data centres can help organisations meet regulations about data sovereignty - the need to hold peoples' data in the country of origin.",
      "\"Under space law, that box of electronics is literally under the law of the licensing or launching state - it is an actual embassy in space,\" he says.",

      "Whether or not a fair comparison, Zelensky's role in keeping his country in the spotlight and convincing allies to invest has certainly been crucial for Ukraine's fight.",
      "His transformation from prime-time comedian to wartime president has long been cast - it dates back to 2022 when he decided to remain in Kyiv as Russian troops closed in. That decision meant Ukraine would go on to defend itself to this day.",
      "In the years since, I've stood across from him in person dozens of times, and Zelensky now casts a more authoritative, perhaps battle-hardened figure, moulded partly by his increased isolation on the international stage.",
      "But with the unpredictability of Trump's second term - not least following the pair's Oval Office bust-up in February - Zelensky may now have to transform again.",
      "Politically it is no longer a story of oppressor versus oppressed. Rather, it is muddied by the dual challenge of voicing an appetite for peace whilst protecting his country's interests.",
      "But is a man used to having so much authority at home and being so influential abroad really going to stage a second big transformation, shifting his focus to Trump-era diplomacy? Or will he decide the best way of standing up for Ukraine is to yield little?",
      "'Very clever and calculated'",
      "Before Trump's chapter two began, Ukraine's leader had effectively lobbied for western support. He appealed for air defences, tanks, rockets and fighter jets, with nations such as Germany hesitating over fears of the war escalating, before yielding to his requests.",
      "His message was rigid and he was successful in procuring support.",
      "\"Zelensky was very clever and calculated in the early days of the war,\" says Ed Arnold from defence and security think tank, Royal United Services Institute (Rusi).",
      "His decision go to the Munich security conference two weeks before the invasion, despite being advised that this would be a security risk, was pivotal, argues Mr Arnold.",
      "\"It personalised support to Ukraine within the minds of people who personally attended.\"",
      "Serhiy Leshchenko, an advisor to Zelensky's office, explains: \"We have to be visible to the world. If public opinion is on Ukraine's side, there is a better chance to get help from the international community.\"",
      "Leshchenko points to Zelensky's daily video addresses, which he has created since start of the invasion. \"It's unusual to be so open.\"",
      "Ukraine's victory in the battle of Kyiv cemented Zelensky as a symbol of the country's survival, and boosted his case for continued military aid from western allies.",
      "Later in 2022, Zelensky was able to demonstrate the difference their supplies were making when swathes of Ukrainian territory, including the city of Kherson, were liberated. He had initial success with European allies.",
      "\"They are invested in Zelensky personally and Ukraine,\" says Mr Arnold. \"He's gone through four UK prime ministers since the start of the war \u2026 and they've all signed new declarations with Ukraine, again through Zelensky.",
      "\"He's been able to weather the changes in national politics within Europe throughout his tenure.\"",
      "But when further successes failed to materialise, Zelensky's message did not change - and as time went on, this would be to his detriment.",
      "After Ukraine's failed counter-offensive in the summer of 2023, for example, the merits of supporting Kyiv were increasingly questioned by an influential minority of US Republicans and pleas were starting to be passed over in some quarters.",
      "Maria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Democratic Initiatives Foundation, a Kyiv-based think tank, believes Zelensky is partly responsible.",
      "\"He and his close circle relied on the logic that they must always be demanding when speaking with their partners - pushing the argument that Ukraine simply needs something. That worked really well during 2022, but with the US and others this kind of messaging stopped working in 2023,\" she argues.",
      "\"But his diplomacy really didn't adjust quickly enough.\"",
      "'Zelensky has never been a diplomat'",
      "On 27 September 2024, in a lobby in New York, things truly changed for Ukraine. Only the driving force was not approaching Russian armour but the political reincarnation of Ukraine's biggest ally: the US.",
      "On that day, just over a month before the US Presidential election, Zelensky had a last minute meeting with Trump in Trump Tower.",
      "Tensions between the pair had heightened before this meeting: Zelensky had claimed a few days earlier that Trump didn't \"really know how to end the war\", after he asserted he could do it in \"one day\".",
      "After the Trump Tower meeting, the two men emerged looking awkward.",
      "Despite announcing a \"common view\" of wanting to end the war, their body language suggested a lack of chemistry.",
      "The pair would not meet again until five months later in the Oval Office, where their now famous encounter would be a diplomatic disaster for Kyiv.",
      "\"Trump should have liked him,\" says Vadym Prystaiko, who was present when the pair first met after Zelensky's election win in 2019. \"Zelensky saw Trump as more or less as himself, as a media guy who moved into politics, who was anti-establishment,\" he says.",
      "Mr Prystaiko was Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, before he was sacked in 2023. Kyiv gave no official reason for the dismissal, but it came after Mr Prystaiko criticised Zelensky's response to a row over gratitude for British military aid. He said there had been a \"little bit of sarcasm\" in his president's response, which he believed was \"unhealthy\".",
      "\"Zelensky has never been a diplomat,\" Mr Prystaiko adds. \"He has never been a usual political leader who kisses babies and shakes hands.\"",
      "A 'rollercoaster' relationship",
      "\"The relationship with Trump is like a rollercoaster,\" says Volodymyr Fesenko, director at the Pento Center for Political Studies. \"Sometimes there is constructive cooperation, and then, all of a sudden, some kind of crisis appears.\"",
      "Then there is their war of words. Trump has blamed Zelensky for starting the war, calling him a \"dictator\", while Ukraine's leader accused his US counterpart  of \"living in a Russian disinformation space\".",
      "While Mr Fesenko believes Zelensky is continually changing tactics to find a working relationship with Washington, Ms Zolkina believes the issues go deeper.",
      "\"There is a triangle between the US administration, the Kremlin and Kyiv,\" she claims. \"Ukraine is considered to be a weaker part of this triangle. For Trump, Zelensky is not in the same league, and that's the problem.\"",
      "When it came to the now infamous Oval Office meeting with Trump and his Vice President JD Vance, this was the first time I'd seen Zelensky seemingly run out of political rope as he was accused of \"not showing enough gratitude\" and \"playing with World War Three\".",
      "His defensive body language, the folding of his arms for example, also seemed new.",
      "Zelensky has always appeared comfortable hosting or visiting other leaders. He is at ease on a stage and often injects timely humour \u2014 but this was different.",
      "A mineral agreement, in which Zelensky had originally suggested trading a portion of Ukraine's mineral resource wealth for continued military aid, was never signed, and has since evolved into a less favourable proposal for Kyiv.",
      "The US would also briefly pause its military aid and intelligence sharing to ensure Ukraine danced to its tune.",
      "But the official view from some is that the Oval Office meeting was not a calamity.",
      "\"Nobody took it as the end of something,\" claims Ihor Brusylo, the deputy head of the Presidential Office, who travelled to the White House with Zelensky. \"We discussed how to move forward. It was not a disaster.\"",
      "When the US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz told them the meeting was over, \"we just shrugged our shoulders and decided to go back to the hotel,\" he recalls.",
      "\"My presumption is that on a personal level, they [Trump and Zelensky] get on well,\" he adds. \"They understand each other better, and are frank and honest.\"",
      "Whatever the truth about their relationship behind closed doors, there have been signs of a willingness to bend from Zelensky since that meeting - European allies are said to have convinced him to subsequently take a more compliant tone, because of the inescapable truth that they, and Ukraine, still need the US to combat an aggressive Russia.",
      "Yet others argue more bend still is needed.",
      "'It is very difficult to bend Zelensky'",
      "\"The war changes everyone, it has changed us all in some sense. But I don't think fundamentally Zelensky has changed - for good or bad in some instances,\" says Olga Onuch, professor of Comparative and Ukrainian Politics at the University of Manchester.",
      "\"It is very clear that certain actors have decided it's difficult to negotiate with Zelensky. Why? Because he has red lines that he is sticking to.\"",
      "Trump has turned his back on the foundation of US economic might - the fallout will be messy",
      "Trump has blown up the world order - and left Europe's leaders scrabbling",
      "Russia's next move? The countries trying to Putin-proof themselves",
      "Mr Brusylo agrees. \"It is very difficult to bend Zelensky,\" he says. \"It's like watching a spring, the more you press, the bigger the pushback.\"",
      "And yet whenever Ukraine is attacked, politically or diplomatically, increased political unity follows. The Oval Office clash was no exception, as Zelensky's popularity rating soared to around 70%.",
      "\"Zelensky is very powerful, and his authority is made up of himself and a certain circle of people,\" argues Ms Zolkina.",
      "Orysia Lutsevych, head of the Ukraine Forum at Chatham House says it's interesting how Ukrainians rallied around Zelensky after the Oval Office, almost like they took it as a personal insult of Ukrainian statehood.",
      "\"People rally around him, what he represents and how he behaves\".",
      "Mr Prystaiko argues if the Americans wanted him to be replaced \"they've shot themselves in the foot as he might easily be re-elected\".",
      "Some political experts, like Ms Zolkina, do not think this is a certainty. \"I don't think he understands that this boost is a direct reaction to what Trump is doing, not his personal position,\" she says.",
      "\"He has pretty strong political ambitions for a second term, and is pretty politically egocentric, as all leaders are at his level.\"",
      "Prof Onuch does not think that pursuit of political power alone motivates Zelensky. \"[He is] much more of a careful and considered and tactical political operator than people give him credit for\".",
      "Still, imagining a Zelensky second term can be difficult, simply because of the sheer demands of the job. Even post-war challenges would be considerable.",
      "For now, Mr Arnold suspects that an exhausted Zelensky would not want to stand again and suggests that he may want a way out from at least the frontline politics.",
      "As for the near-term, Zelensky cannot afford another Oval Office. So, given that Trump is a keen player, will Ukraine's leader ever join him for a round of golf?",
      "\"He is a quick learner,\" says his Mr Brusylo. \"When there is a need to play golf, I'm sure he will tackle this task.\"",

It is now joined by his 1969 experimental album, \"Bitches Brew,\" which marked an even further departure from traditional jazz. Davis composed most of the two-discs' long-form tracks (with Wayne Shorter and Joe Zawinul each contributing one). Critic Robert Christgau described the music here as \"very much like jazz and something like rock.\"",

    "story": [
      "Journalist E.A. Hanks shared that her father, actor Tom Hanks, and brother, Colin Hanks, were among the first to read her deeply personal new memoir, \"The Ten: A Memoir of Family and the Open Road,\" which details her childhood with her late mother.",
      "\"The first thing my dad said is, 'This is an accurate portrayal of what it was to love and fear this woman.' Once I knew that I had gotten her right, everything else flowed,\" she said during an appearance on \"CBS Mornings\" on Wednesday.",
      "The book details Hanks' six-month journey along Interstate 10 from California to Florida, during which she sought to better understand Susan Dillingham \u2014 who died in 2002 \u2014 and reflect on her own difficult childhood.",
      "\"I'm just another girl trying to make sense of her dead, crazy mother,\" Hanks said.",
      "Hanks revealed that while growing up, she had language to understand addiction \u2014 her mother hosted 12-step programs in their home \u2014 but lacked vocabulary for mental illness.",
      "\"My mom \u2014 I had language for addiction because we used to host 12-step programs in our house, and my mom would have sponsees stay with us. I had a language even from 8 years old about addiction, but there was no language for mental health and what was sort of wrong in the house,\" Hanks explained. \"A lot of the book is me trying to create that language and share it.\"",
      "The author described her mother's \"fluid\" relationship with reality, saying in the book that \"mom's relationship with reality was fluid. Truth was fed through the meat grinder of mental illness.\"",
      "She detailed both emotional and physical abuse in her childhood home. Hanks explained that in California during the late 1980s, family law typically required evidence of physical abuse before a child could be removed from a situation.",
      "\"Family law in California in the late '80s wasn't enough room for it. At that time, you kind of had to have the receipts of physical abuse to get pulled out of a situation. And once we crossed that rubicon is when I moved to Los Angeles,\" she said.",
      "What Hanks learned about her mother",
      "Despite the difficult relationship, Hanks said she remained protective of her mother. In writing the memoir, she incorporated her mother's poetry as a way to reconnect with her.",
      "\"At the time, my mom kind of had this stance like a thoroughbred who had been put out to pasture too soon, and she didn't get her chance as an artist because of my dad's, as I describe it, catastrophic fame,\" Hanks said. \"I think including her poetry in the book is a way of treating her seriously as an artist and getting back into conversation with her. And anybody who's buried a parent knows that a two-way conversation suddenly becomes a one-way conversation.\"",
      "When asked about the truth she now understands, Hanks reflected, \"The truth is, my mother had good days and bad days. And I was lucky to experience the good days, and I was shaped by the bad days. All of the care and protection I had for the child that I was doesn't diminish what happened between us. But it means that as I get older, there's more wiggle room and acceptance for her flaws and mine.\"",
      "The memoir also explores themes of place and identity. As a journalist accustomed to interviewing others, Hanks discovered, \"When you're talking to stone-cold strangers, you can't start with, 'Tell me about your mom,' but you can start with, 'Tell me where you're from.' If someone wants to talk about their hometown, it's an elevator to their deepest self.\"",
      "She added, \"Identity and where you're from, that's the whole story. I learned that I'm the product of where I'm from.\"",

      "The stardom came at a cost to the child. He told the Los Angeles Daily News in 1993 that he had been abused by his aunt and uncle, who would be with him on set while North's single mom was at work. \"If it took me more than one or two takes, I would be threatened and then whacked,\" North said.",

      "After appearing on stage in \"Butterflies Are Free,\" North had a brief stint in the Navy in the 1970s, and tried to return to show business with more mature, darker roles. Aside from a 1985 Yugoslavian World War II film, \"Wild Wind,\" North's appearances were mostly playing off his child actor past. He satirized his Dennis the Menace role on HBO's \"Not Necessarily the News,\" and played himself in a 1999 episode of \"The Simpsons\" and the David Spade comedy \"Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star.\"",

      "Commit to What Matters",
      "I had come from a world of higher-end restaurants, of finesse and creativity. So a tapas restaurant was not exactly what I was looking for. But my new partners in Washington, DC, had a clear idea: they wanted to open a Spanish restaurant that was fun. They called it Jaleo, which means \"merrymaking, a joyful celebration,\" inspired by the John Singer Sargent painting of a Spanish woman dancing to guitars. It lives in Boston, but it had traveled on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, and they had seen it there. They even painted a reproduction of it on a wall of the new restaurant.",
      "I understood that sense of joy. I'm the kind of guy who doesn't like tables. I prefer standing up at bars. If I can, I like to hop around to five different bars and eat good food at each one. Jaleo was a chance to show how I like to enjoy life. These little plates of tapas were also a chance to give people more access to different bites of Spanish food, different tastes of the various regions of Spain. Maybe people didn't know what they wanted to eat, and the small plates would be a way to move a little bit further out of their comfort zones. Of course, it was an opportunity to make a mark for myself. And I could do that while being a kind of ambassador for my country, in the capital of the United States, not too far from the White House and the US Capitol. It felt like an extension of my military service, going from port to port on a historic tall-mast ship, showing the best of Spain to the world.",
      "I knew there were immigrants before me who had brought Spanish food to every corner of America. They opened restaurants, maybe some of them played guitar or danced flamenco. They were mythical places. Tio Pepe in Baltimore. Caf\u00e9 San Martin in New York. Montse Guill\u00e9n's El Internacional in Tribeca, which was short-lived but put Spanish food and drink on the map. There was already a high-end Spanish restaurant in Washington called Taberna del Alabardero, and the more informal Churreria Madrid in Adams Morgan.",
      "Washington at that time was not seen as a culinary mecca, even by the people of DC, and Jaleo opened in a downtown neighborhood, known as Penn Quarter, that was empty at night. But it would not stay that way. It would become a very important part of the city, not too far away from where all the big decisions were made that affected the country and the world. It was a part of the city where senators, congressmen, lobbyists, and business executives would gather. It was the home of new businesses like America Online, and so many other amazing new companies. Slowly but surely, Jaleo became a huge success.",
      "That's not to say it was easy. I was young, just twenty-three years old, and I was still learning how to run a kitchen. The movie in my head cast me as the creative guy, but now I needed to learn how to run the place. Fortunately, I had a wonderful, patient teacher: Ann Cashion, who was the first executive chef of Jaleo, showed me how to do the job properly, even though I preferred the creative side of things.",
      "We didn't really know whether American diners would accept these little plates, or the idea of sharing plates at all. What happened if people didn't want to share? Our waiters were concerned and would often tell me how some people said they weren't comfortable with sharing. I had a simple answer. If they didn't want to share, they could move the plate ten inches closer to them and use their knife and fork to protect the dish for themselves. I wasn't going to Americanize tapas for them. It's what we did in the south of Spain and in Catalonia. They would adapt because it was a fun way to be with friends. Who doesn't want to dig a fork into the plate of the person across the table?",
      "My heart was full of the joy that comes from introducing Spanish food to new people. That joy translated into happy guests eating the dishes I knew. Jaleo was a place where I could share what I knew about Spanish food: croquetas, gazpacho, gambas al ajillo, sangria. But it was also a way to learn more about what I didn't know about Spanish food. I had not traveled all across Spain at the age of twenty-three, nor did I know about all of Spanish gastronomy. Far from it. The reality is that you need to keep learning in any line of work. People say I'm one of the biggest experts in Spanish cooking, but I still feel clueless sometimes. Every time I go back to Spain and discover a new ingredient or a new dish, it feels to me the same as looking at the stars. You can see a few, but how many more are out there that you cannot see? You can read books, and you can travel, but learning is a lifetime of curiosity and discovery.",
      "Sometimes that work can feel less joyful and more of struggle. In particular, in those early days, it was a struggle to buy the right ingredients. Believe it or not, I'm a pragmatic guy. You can support the local economy, buying local fruit and vegetables for instance. But there are some ingredients that cannot be replaced. I observed the success of Italy, where they have been amazingly successful in supporting the small towns where their unique food products are made. I believed we could do the same for the small towns and food producers of Spain. Manchego cheese is like no other. Sweet roasted piquillo peppers are unique. Our olive oil is the envy of Europe, and even gets repackaged under Italian names. Our sherry vinegar is unmatched. And nothing compares to our pure-bred Ib\u00e9rico ham, the very best ham in the world. You can't have Spanish cooking without some of the staples. It was a symbiotic relationship.",
      "Still, importing food is not always easy. There are regulations and policies, rules to protect consumers and businesses. The US Department of Agriculture insists that slaughterhouses operate according to American standards, not European ones, if they want to sell their meat in the United States. They need to be inspected, even though Europeans have been eating these foods for centuries without any problems. It was crazy but also fascinating. Of course, it wasn't just a question of safety; there were concerns that ham from Spain would hurt ham in America. So one day I met a bearded man visiting Washington, and he happened to be a great Ib\u00e9rico ham producer who was investing to comply with US regulations at his slaughterhouse: Santiago Mart\u00edn, the owner of Embutidos Ferm\u00edn. I helped producers like Santiago navigate these challenges with Congress and the administration, finding a lawyer who assisted the Italians in bringing Parma ham to America. Because in reality these European hams were much more expensive than the American hams, and they helped elevate the perception of all pork products in America. It was a win-win for America and Spain.",
      "That's the world of work. Your commitment to your values, to what's important, can turn a seemingly small decision\u2014like buying a type of roasted pepper or a slice of ham\u2014into something as big as international relations.",
      "Your sense of responsibility is what matters. How was I going to be a Spanish chef without all these ingredients? I had to do the work, just like other chefs and importers who made Spanish food available in the United States. People like Tim Harris, who created the incredible Spanish food store La Tienda, and Juana Gimeno Faraone, who started La Espa\u00f1ola Meats. Or Almudena de Llaguno and Steve Metzler bringing Spanish wines to America; and Jorge Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez, who would walk the streets of Manhattan with a big bag filled with wine bottles, trying to get his wines into a few restaurants. The whole ecosystem of Spanish food people kept me going, and I needed to play my part, too.",
      "So Jaleo became much more than a restaurant; it was a way to build bridges between these two countries, to inspire American chefs to buy and cook with Spanish ingredients, to spread the culture that made me who I am. Something like 80 percent of all restaurants close before they reach their five-year anniversary. Jaleo has now been open for thirty years, and we have new Jaleos in Orlando, Las Vegas, and even Dubai. Because we committed from the first year to what we value\u2014to what matters\u2014even when we didn't yet have all the expertise to make it happen.",
      "I feel a sense of joy when I see Ib\u00e9rico ham, or Spanish anchovies, or wines from the Bierzo region in restaurants and shops. I know that nothing would have happened without the persistence and vision of so many people who may now be forgotten. They built the bridges that will last forever\u2014because they cared so deeply.",
      "Follow what you feel is your purpose\u2014not what others tell you to do. Otherwise you lose your soul and become a commodity. Don't be a commodity. Be true to yourself.",

      "Nintendo has announced a June 5 launch date for its latest gaming console, the Switch 2, which will introduce interactive chat and screenshare functions to connect gamers. Pre-orders in the U.S., however, will not start April 9 as expected \"in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,\" Nintendo said, promising to update timing soon.",
      "At its 60-minute Nintendo Direct presentation, the company revealed a more vibrant display on the Switch 2, a larger screen and several games that will launch with the console.",
      "Central to its updated system is a new \"C\" button on its Joy-Con controller, which will launch a new \"GameChat\" feature that allows you to \"communicate with friends and family while playing a game\" and lets you share your game screen with other players. A built-in microphone will also allow you to chat with other gamers. The \"GameChat\" feature requires a subscription to Nintendo's Switch online service.",
      "\"When you think about some of the biggest titles on (the Nintendo Switch), it's like Mario Kart, Super Mario Jamboree, even though that's quite a new title, has cracked the top 10 of most play games on the console. So, it does make a lot of sense that the sort of headline feature is geared primarily towards that sort of use,\" said Hannah Cowton-Barnes, a London-based video game industry expert for Tech Advisor.",
      "Perhaps the most contemporary function yet for the Switch 2 is the ability to use the Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse. The developer displayed multiple ways to use the new function in games, such as angling a club in a golf game.",
      "The new portable console features a 7.9 inch LCD screen that displays in 1080p. Nintendo also revealed in the live stream that, when docked, the system will be able to support 4K resolution for compatible games.",
      "Wednesday's presentation started off with an extended look at \"Mario Kart World\" \u2014 the console's launch bundle game \u2014 which adds a bit of flair to the series with in-game characters doing tailwhips, flips, rail grinds and other tricks.",
      "The developer also unveiled a new James Bond game, dubbed \"Project 007,\" revisiting a classic Nintendo 64 console hit revered by many first-person shooter fans.",
      "Nintendo also announced two more Switch 2 exclusives featuring its marquee characters. \"Donkey Kong Bananza,\" a 3D adventure with the big ape punching his way through a huge underground world, arrives July 17. \"Kirby Air Riders,\" a racing game from the director of the \"Super Smash Bros.\" series, is due later in the year.",
      "Third-party exclusives likely to create some buzz include Koei-Tecmo's \"Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment,\" a hack-and-slash prequel to \"The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom,\" coming this winter. From Software's \"The Duskbloods,\" a baroque multiplayer title from the creators of Elden Ring, is scheduled for 2026.",
      "Miss the GameCube? Nintendo said Switch Online subscribers will be able to access a limited selection of GameCube titles such as \"The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker\" and \"F-Zero GX.\"",
      "The new console will be backwards compatible \u2014 able to play physical and digital Switch games \u2014 but users will need to purchase a microSD express memory card for the Switch 2. The presentation revealed that normal SD cards will not be compatible with the system. However, data from the original Switch can be transferred to the new console using a transfer feature.",
      "The original Switch, released in 2017, is \"one of the most popular game consoles of all time,\" Scott Stein, editor-at-large at CNET,\u00a0told CBS News Boston in January.",
      "It became popular in part because of its unique design. Resembling a tablet, the device has detachable pieces on each side that can be used to control game play. It also allows users to continuing playing a game on a television screen when docked on a charging station, a first-of-its-kind feature at the time.",
      "But the original has aged, leading to some of the excitement for the new version, Stein said.",
      "\"There's a lot of stuff it does well but there's a lot of stuff that people I think want it to do better for playing games they can play elsewhere,\" he said, noting the ability to take it on the go differentiates it from other gaming consoles.",
      "How much does the Nintendo Switch 2 cost?",
      "Nintendo will retail the Switch 2 for $449.99 at launch, which is significantly higher than the original Switch's $299 price tag. A separate bundle that includes the new \"Mario Kart World\" game will also be available for $499.99.",
      "Gene Park, a Washington Post reporter covering video games and gaming culture, told CBS News the console is \"a little pricey, but it is a more powerful system.\"",
      "He noted that the \"Mario Kart World\" game itself is priced at $80.",
      "\"It's a little eyebrow-raising. It's really the first Nintendo game to broach $80, and there's a lot of talk about video games becoming $100 right now,\" Park said.",
      "The Trump administration's tariffs have hit the video game console industry at a fragile moment, said Joost van Dreunen, author of \"One Up: Creativity, Competition, and the Global Business of Video Games.",
      "\"At the beginning of a new hardware cycle, all of a sudden we're looking at this price hike,\" said van Dreunen, a games industry researcher. \"I had originally predicted that the Switch 2 would be $400. Now it's announced that it's $450. That $50 difference is a Trump tax.\"",
      "The tariffs, he said, impact games hardware because console devices are manufactured and shipped from China and that region at large.",
      "The early stages of a hardware life cycle are already very low margin, or usually a loss for hardware manufacturers, van Dreunen said. Those manufacturers typically eat the margin in order to get the devices out to stores.",
      "\"But with an increased tariff, that means that margin is probably even worse than it historically is. But their hands are kind of tied. They can't not progress. They can't not launch a new hardware generation. So for the consumer base, people are just going to pay more.\"",
      "The Consumer Technology Association also predicted President Trump's tariffs would drive up prices of video game consoles, and retailers like Best Buy have warned they may have to raise prices due to the tariffs.",
      "Nintendo plans to host \"Switch 2 Experience\" events in several countries, where gamers can get a hands-on experience with the new system. Those events are planned for cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London and Paris beginning this month.",

      "Marks also said he recently warned U.S. senators that more deaths would occur if the administration didn't mount a more aggressive response to the outbreak. Kennedy has been called to testify before the Senate health committee on Thursday.",
      "Texas doctors on high alert",
      "The death of a second unvaccinated child with measles in West Texas has doctors in North Texas, like Dr. Carla Garcia Carreno, the Children's Medical Center Plano director for infection prevention and control, on high alert.",
      "\"Measles, as we know, it's a preventable disease. Unfortunately, a majority of the cases that we're seeing right now in the outbreak are in unvaccinated people,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Garcia Carreno said the hospital has been preparing to see patients in North Texas since the measles outbreak started in West Texas in January.",
      "\"They need to be seen, and it's very important to try to get the test as early as possible and isolate those people that are suspected to have the measles or have the measles,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Garcia Carreno   said to check your medical records to see if you've gotten the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. You can get a blood test if you can't find your vaccine history. The blood test checks for measles antibodies.",
      "\"We do need to have a population that is immune against measles,\" Garcia Carreno said. \"At least 95% of the population needs to be protected, either immune because of the vaccination or because they have a history of having had the infection.\"",
      "Garcia Carreno said the vaccine is 93% effective after one dose and 97% effective after two doses. Babies as young as six months can get an early dose.",
      "\"Unvaccinated adults can receive the vaccine with doses at least 28 days apart,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "About 20%of unvaccinated children who get measles may need to be hospitalized, and between one to three cases in every 1,000 is fatal.",
      "\"If you get the measles and are unvaccinated, your immune system is going to be suppressed for weeks to months and seven to 10 years later, even more than that, you can have a very fatal, brain inflammation,\" Garcia Carreno said.",
      "Experts said it's even more important to get vaccinated ahead of the busy summer travel season to keep the virus under control.",
      "CDC teams deploy",
      "Kennedy said Sunday that in March, he deployed a CDC team \"to bolster local and state capacity for response across multiple Texas regions, supply pharmacies and Texas-run clinics with needed MMR vaccines and other medicines and medical supplies, work with local schools and healthcare facilities to support contact investigations, and to reach out to communities, including faith leaders, to answer any questions or respond to locations seeking healthcare.\"",
      "The Health Secretary said, at Gov. Greg Abbott's request, CDC teams have been redeployed to Texas.",
      "Experts and local health officials expect the outbreak to go on for several more months if not a year. In West Texas, the vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated people and children younger than 17.",
      "With several states facing outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable disease, some worry that measles may cost the U.S. its status as having eliminated the disease.",
      "Measles is a respiratory virus that can survive in the air for up to two hours. Up to 9 out of 10 people who are susceptible will get the virus if exposed, according to the CDC. The first shot is recommended for children ages 12 to 15 months, and the second for ages 4 to 6 years.",

    "summary": "Consumers fraudulently enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage could receive unexpected tax bills \u2014 possibly their only clue they've been victimized.",
    "story": [
      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has begun redeploying staff to respond to the deadly outbreak of measles in Texas, a spokesperson said Monday, a week after steep layoffs at the agency impacted its response to the spread of the virus.",
      "\"A team of three deployed yesterday to meet with county and state officials to assess the immediate needs to respond to this outbreak. The team is meeting with officials again today,\" CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald said in an email.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. first said Sunday that the CDC would be redeploying to Texas at its governor's request, after another unvaccinated child died in the measles outbreak. An 8-year-old girl was the second fatality there this year.",
      "\"Once the assessment is complete, more CDC staff will be sent to Texas per Sec. Kennedy's order and the governor's request. The first teams deployed to Texas arrived on March and returned to CDC on April 1,\" McDonald said.",
      "Multiple agency staff working on the CDC's measles response were among the thousands cut from the agency last week, officials have told CBS News.",
      "A handful of employees at agencies within the department have been brought back to work so far, multiple officials said, at least through the end of the 60 day period before their layoff notices formally take effect.",
      "McDonald did not comment on whether laid-off staff who had been working on the agency's measles response would be among those Kennedy might reinstate.",
      "The ongoing outbreak in Texas and neighboring states has driven this year's tally of U.S. measles cases to the highest levels seen since a large wave of cases in 2019, which was the worst in the U.S. in decades.",
      "While dozens of measles cases are reported every year, usually linked to undervaccinated travelers returning from trips outside the country, health authorities have warned that ongoing community spread of the virus this year is now threatening America's status of having eliminated endemic spread of the virus.",
      "There have been six measles outbreaks so far this year, a CDC spokesperson told CBS News on Friday. The outbreak in Texas and neighboring states makes up the majority of cases. Smaller outbreaks are also ongoing in New Jersey, Georgia, Ohio and Kansas.",
      "Details of the sixth outbreak have not yet been released, the spokesperson said, citing patient privacy.",
      "Kennedy calls vaccine \"most effective way\" to stop measles spread",
      "While in Texas, Kennedy also posted on X that the \"most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" The MMR vaccine protects against measles, mumps and rubella, and is normally given in two doses in early childhood.",
      "Kennedy's range of statements about the measles vaccine in recent weeks have drawn scrutiny from health experts, including after a Fox News interview in which he falsely inflated the shot's risks.",
      "In a later post, Kennedy also said he had met with \"two extraordinary healers\" who he said have \"healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children using aerosolized budesonide and clarithromycin.\"",
      "Budesonide can sometimes help to treat respiratory illnesses, reducing inflammation in the lungs, said pediatrics professor Dr. James Campbell of the University of Maryland in an email in March. CBS News reached out to Campbell after Kennedy previously hailed \"miraculous and instantaneous recovery\" from use of these treatments.",
      "\"In 2025, we should not have to treat measles in the US because it is completely preventable, but of course, like all preventable diseases, we do,\" said Campbell.",
      "Campbell is vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee that develops recommendations for treating measles and other infectious diseases.",
      "Clarithromycin, an antibacterial drug, has no effect on viruses like measles but can be used by doctors to treat coinfections from some bacterial pneumonias that sometimes develop in infected children, Campbell said. However, it does not work for all bacteria.",
      "\"These choices should be made on an individual basis by the doctors, not as sweeping recommendations for all children with measles,\" said Campbell. He said that the drugs don't have evidence proving they should be used as routine treatments for measles and cautioned against \"sweeping statements about how those singular choices related to treatment of measles in general.\"",
      "\"Vaccination will prevent measles, but for those who do get measles, rigorous studies, and not anecdotal reports, will help us to better treat them,\" said Campbell.",
      "Kennedy's embrace of alternative therapies has been contradicted by other health experts, including former Trump administration officials.",
      "\"My children and grandchildren will not die of measles, because they are vaccinated.\u00a0 And there is no substitute, nor any effective treatment, for measles,\" Dr. Brett Giroir, an adviser to the department this year, wrote in an opinion piece published by RealClearHealth last week.",
      "The editorial from Giroir, who previously worked as assistant secretary of health during President Trump's first term, was published before news of the second child to die in the Texas measles outbreak. In the U.S., a child last died from measles in 2015.",
      "\"One child's death from measles is a tragedy not only for the family and their community but also for our nation.\u00a0 If we can't stop measles, really what can we do?\u00a0 Let's not wait for another tragedy,\" Giroir said.",

      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "The European Union announced on April 9 tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including beauty products, soybeans and motorcycles, according to AFP.",

      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect today at a rate of 104%.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. But on Wednesday afternoon the president announced he is pausing most of the new import taxes for 90 days and lowering the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately,",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump said he's increasing the tariff on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president continued, \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"",
      "China decries U.S. \"mistake\"",
      "China's announcement signals Beijing isn't backing down in a global trade war sparked by Mr. Trump's April 2 decision to levy so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every nation. In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Beijing has also expanded its exports to other countries, particularly developing nations, as it seeks to lessen its reliance on the U.S., research group Onyx Strategic Insights noted in a recent report.",
      "\"China has spent the last five years Trump-proofing its economy \u2014 it has been working to nationalize supply chains, it has been working to penetrate different export markets, particularly in the developing world,\" Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. China is \"willing to endure the pain, thinking they can handle it longer than we can, and they might have a point.\"",
      "China was the third-largest export market for the U.S. in 2023, following Canada and Mexico, with $145 billion in goods shipped to the Asian nation that year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. Oilseeds and grains are the top export that the U.S. sends to China, followed by oil and gas.",
      "EU also hitting back",
      "Separately, the European Union on Wednesday announced its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. The 27-country trading bloc announced tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products, according to AFP.",
      "\"The EU considers U.S. tariffs unjustified and damaging, causing economic harm to both sides, as well as the global economy,\"\u00a0 the European Commission said in a statement issued after EU member states approved the measures.",

    "summary": "A new breed of veterinary clinic is changing how pets \u2014 and their owners \u2014 are treated. \"I'd rather see four pets a day,\" one vet said.",
    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At Veterinary Emergency Group (VEG), this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG's most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer VEG hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",

Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",

      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",

The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",

      "Because of past fraud by rogue brokers, some Affordable Care Act policyholders may get an unexpected tax bill this season.",
      "But that isn't the only potential shock. Other changes coming soon - stemming from proposals by the administration of President Donald Trump - could affect their coverage and its cost. And sorting out related problems and challenges may take longer as federal workers are laid off and funding for assistance programs is cut.",
      "First up: taxes",
      "Tax season is when some consumers learn they were fraudulently enrolled in an ACA plan or switched to a different one without their knowledge.",
      "Those unauthorized enrollments or changes took off in late 2023 and continued through last year, drawing more than 274,000 complaints in the first eight months of 2024 to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, mostly about rogue agents or call centers.",
      "Tax problems can arise if those enrollments resulted in premium tax credits exceeding the amount the consumer should have received. In those cases, consumers may have to pay all or part of those credits back. The amount owed could range from a few hundred dollars to thousands, with some caps based on income.",
      "The first clue some people have is when they get a 1095-A form in the mail.",
      "Those documents are sent out by the state and federal marketplaces to the IRS and ACA enrollees, showing any tax credit payments made to health insurers on a taxpayer's behalf. Taxpayers use the premium tax credit information from the 1095-A when completing their return.",
      "Returns can be held up if the IRS has information indicating the taxpayer has ACA coverage that they failed to report on their return, or if there are other discrepancies.",
      "The Biden administration last year took steps to slow the fraudulent switching, including requiring a three-way call between the broker, client, and marketplace for some enrollment issues.",
      "\"While we may be seeing less [fraud], we're still dealing with 2024 taxes,\" said Erin Kinard, director of systems and intake for the Health and Economic Opportunity Program at Pisgah Legal Services, a nonprofit serving western North Carolina that offers both legal help and assistance with ACA problems.",
      "Consumers who suspect they were fraudulently enrolled should immediately call their federal or state ACA marketplace, experts say. Some consumers will be referred to special federal caseworkers throught he marketplaces. But some of those caseworkers are now part of the broad reduction in force by theTrump administration.",
      "In recent days, \"they laid off two divisions on the Affordable Care Act side,\" said Jeffrey Grant, who oversaw ACA issues as CMS' deputy director for operations in the Center for Consumer Information and Insurance Oversight before leaving in February.",
      "With fewer caseworkers, \"it will take longer to get problems taken care of,\" said Grant, who is now president of Schedule F Healthcare Strategies, a consulting group that aims to help laid-off federal workers find new jobs. \"The marketplace is twice as big as it was the last time the Trump administration was here, and now they are cutting caseworkers to less than were around then.\"",

      "And these cases are difficult because the rogue brokers who enrolled consumers sometimes misstated their income so they would qualify for the largest tax credits possible. Other consumers have found they were enrolled even though they had affordable employer coverage, making them ineligible for ACA subsidies.",
      "That's what happened to Anthony Akra and his wife, Ashley Zukoski, in Charlotte, North Carolina. They were enrolled in a plan without their knowledge in 2023, by a broker in Florida with whom they had never spoken. The couple had health insurance through Zukoski's employer. The broker listed an income that qualified the household for a large subsidy that fully offset the monthly premium cost, so the couple never received a bill. One day, a 1095-A form showed up in their mailbox.",
      "\"I didn't know what the hell it was,\" said Akra, who said the form showed that he had been receiving hundreds of dollars a month in premium tax credits.",
      "He would owe a big chunk of that back unless he could get the plan retroactively canceled. Because their pharmacy, part of a national chain, had switched them to the new plan, also without telling them, they had used the new coverage every time they filled a prescription. That inadvertent use of the policy complicated their efforts to get the fraudulent coverage revoked.",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS withheld more than $4,000 from their tax refund based on the information sent through that 1095-A form.\u00a0 Months passed, but with assistance from a \"navigator\" program \u2014 a government-fundednonprofit that helps people deal with insurance problems \u2014 they were able to get the incorrectinsurance canceled and a refund at the end of October.",
      "It is not unusual for people to spend weeks or even months trying to sort out the mess, said Kinard, whose organization is similar to the one that helped Akra.",
      "While navigator programs nationwide are still operating to help people sign up for health coverage or address issues, the Trump administration has targeted their funding for a 90% cut. Meanwhile, ACA enrollees may face a range of other surprises due to policy and budget steps proposed by the Trump administration.",
      "More Potential Changes",
      "Congress must decide whether to extend premium tax credits that were enhanced during the covid pandemic, which expanded eligibility for the credits and made them larger for many enrollees. Keeping them in place would be expensive, with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation estimating it would add $335 billion to the deficit through 2034.",
      "That debate will come amid another deficit-affecting decision: whether to extend tax cuts enacted during the first Trump administration, which would add trillions to the budget deficit through 2034.",
      "If the enhanced subsidies are not renewed, monthly premium costs would rise by an average of over 75%, according to KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. Premiums could more than double in some states, including many GOP-led ones, such as Texas, Mississippi, Utah, Wyoming, and West Virginia.",
      "That could spark a political backlash. Additionally, the enhanced subsidies are seen as a main reason for strong enrollment growth, leading to more than 24 million people signing up for ACA plans for this year.",
      "A recent KFF study found the 15 states with the most enrollment growth since 2020 were all won by Trump in 2024.",
      "A proposed rule released last month by the Trump administration includes provisions to shorten the annual enrollment period, get rid of a special open enrollment period that allows low-income people to sign up year-round, and require stricter verification of income and other information when people apply for coverage. The administration says most of these steps are needed to reduce fraud in the system.",
      "The administration estimates that 750,000 to 2 million fewer people would enroll in coverage as a result of the changes.",
      "The new rule, if finalized, will make it harder for people to enroll, said Xonjenese Jacobs, director of Florida Covering Kids & Families at the University of South Florida College of Public Health. Losing the year-round enrollment for very low-income people, for example, would affect people short on cash who move often to stay with relatives or friends, and those who have unsteady employment, making it hard to know when or where to enroll and what their income might be in the coming year.",
      "\"They don't have the same ability to plan,\" Jacobs said. \"It's definitely going to make a difference for a lot of the individuals that we service.\""

      "Starting tomorrow, the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China, as President Trump follows through on a threat issued against Beijing on Truth Social Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products. China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in his Truth Social post that the U.S. would cease all negotiations with China, while proceeding with trade talks with other nations.",
      "China's commerce ministry on Tuesday asserted that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if Mr. Trump did not walk back his latest threat.",
      "In the press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said retaliatory tariffs on roughly 90 countries were designed to open negotiations with the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "\"To countries around the world, bring us your best offers and he will listen,\" Leavitt said of Mr. Trump. \"Deals will only be made if they benefit American workers.\"",
      "She added that 70 nations have already approached the White House to begin negotiations and presumably lower their assigned tariff rates in exchange for concessions that Mr. Trump deems beneficial to the U.S.",
      "\"On the other hand, countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate, and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers are making a mistake,\" Leavitt said.",
      "She also reiterated Mr. Trump's \"firm belief\" that the U.S. needs to prioritize the bringing of manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has a spine of steel and will not break,\" she said, later adding that \"a strong America cannot be solely dependent on foreign countries for our food, medicines and critical minerals.\"",
      "Critics of Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including some prominent Wall Street figures, say levies could stoke inflation and slow the U.S. economy.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.",
      "Economists are also raising the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession on Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement, with Goldman Sachs analysts on Monday putting the odds of the economy entering a recession within the next 12 months at at 45%, up from 35% in its previous forecast.",
      "Goldman cited tightening financial conditions, consumer boycotts of U.S. goods and uncertainty over the Trump administration's economic policies, saying those factors are \"likely to depress capital spending\" by more than the bank had previously forecast.",

    "summary": "Small business owner Emily Ley says new U.S. tariffs on China will devastate her stationery store, calling the added costs \"catastrophic.\"",
    "story": [
      "Many U.S. small businesses could face a financial crunch as President Trump's reciprocal tariffs take effect on Wednesday, slapping new import duties on products from almost every nation across the globe.",
      "Some small businesses told CBS News they're worried about the impact from the sharp increase in tariffs that they'll soon be required to pay to the federal government. After paying the levies, they said they'll be left with two choices: raise the prices they charge customers or swallow the costs and take a financial hit.",
      "Small businesses, generally defined as enterprises with fewer than 500 employees and revenue of less than $7.5 million, account for almost half of all private-sector employment in the U.S. But they're also more vulnerable to tariff costs because they don't have the deep pockets or financial flexibility of large businesses, noted Aaron Terrazas, an economist at Gusto, which provides payroll and HR services to small and midsize businesses.",
      "\"For many small businesses, this is a one-two punch,\" Terrazas said. \"They are getting higher prices from suppliers, and their customers are more skittish\" just as they're grappling with heavier tariffs.",
      "Among those businesses reckoning with the added costs is Simplified, an online stationery business that has manufactured its colorful planners in China since 2013. Its owner, Emily Ley, told CBS News that the new reciprocal tariffs \"will have a devastating impact\" on her business, costing her an additional $630,000 in fees over the next year.",
      "On April 3, Ley filed a lawsuit\u00a0alleging Mr. Trump has exceeded his authority in dictating the import duties. Under the Constitution, Congress has the power to impose tariffs and regulate foreign commerce.",
      "\"This additional tax burden is catastrophic to our business,\" Ley added. \"We've already raised our prices as much as possible to absorb previous tariff increases. There's a limit to how much we can increase prices before we price ourselves out of the market.\"",
      "To cope with the costs, she said the company is reducing salaries and scaling back expansion plans.",
      "Recipe for a revival?",
      "Mr. Trump has said tariffs will revive American manufacturing by incentivizing both domestic and foreign companies to build factories in the U.S. But small businesses, which typically operate on thin margins, generally don't have the capacity to quickly shift their supply chains or build local production facilities given the higher cost of labor in the U.S.",
      "Even large businesses that have the financial heft to move its plants back to the U.S., such as Apple, would require years to build a factory in the U.S., noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in an April 8 research note.",
      "\"Maybe over time, we will build a supplier base, but that takes time,\" Terrazas said. \"But in the interim there is this transition period that is very perilous for small businesses.\"",
      "Not all small businesses can wait that long. Alyssa Chambers, the founder of NOVA Essence Inside Out, which makes candles and other wellness products, said she plans to absorb the cost of tariffs applied to the Chinese-made candle jars and waxes she relies on \u2014 for now.",
      "Chambers said she would reassess her business' pricing toward the end of summer and depending on the state of the economy.",
      "For small businesses, buying from American manufacturers isn't really an option, Chambers added, noting that a U.S.-made candle jar costs about $12 each. By contrast, she can buy a 15-pack of jars made in China for about $20. Although she expects that price to rise to about $40 after the tariffs hit home, it's still cheaper than buying domestically.",
      "Other small businesses simply don't have the option of buying from domestic manufacturers, said Matt Weyandt, co-founder of chocolate maker Xocolatl. Because cocoa is grown near the equator, very little of it can be grown in the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"Despite that, we'll now be paying an additional 10% or more for all of our cocoa beans on top of their already elevated prices,\" Weyandt said. \"This is not going to bring cocoa farming jobs to the U.S. or increase American manufacturing \u2014 it's just going to hurt American chocolate manufacturers.\"",
      "To be sure, there are some small businesses that could continue to thrive even with higher tariffs Terrazas said. That includes domestic food manufacturers or health care businesses that don't rely on imports, such as elder or child care companies.",
      "Skittish consumers",
      "Small businesses are coping with the tariffs just as Americans are growing more pessimistic about the economy, with consumer confidence slumping to a 12-year low last month.",
      "\"In the long term, American consumers are really remarkable. But in the short term, it's hard,\" said Kevin Klowden, an economist with the Milken Institute, a think tank. \"It is definitely different because this is an intent to force a structural shift.\"",
      "But, Klowden added, Mr. Trump is doing so \"by significantly putting pressure on the cost structure of the entire system.\"",
      "Whether inflation-weary consumers will accept price hikes from businesses remains to be seen. If the tariffs aren't reduced, inflation could pick up this year, reaching as high as 4% by year end, up from about 2.8% currently, according to Wall Street economists.",
      "\"This is a moment of elevated risk for the economy,\" Terrazas said.",

    "summary": "President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on dozens of countries go into effect Wednesday. Here's what to know about the import taxes.",
    "story": [
      "A core element of the protectionist trade policies President Trump\u00a0announced last week\u00a0\u2014 an import tax blitz on long-standing global trade partners he referred to as \"Liberation Day\" \u2014 are so-called reciprocal tariffs.",
      "The additive tariffs were unveiled alongside an across-the-board levy of 10% on\u00a0dozens of nations and territories, from major exporters to the U.S. such as China to the British-controlled Falkland Islands, which has fewer than 4,000 residents.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in the April 2 news conference, touting the tariffs as a way to boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with countries he said impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products.",
      "But economists note that that in addition to roiling global commerce and driving up costs\u00a0for U.S. consumers and businesses, the tit-for-tat tariffs with key trading partners are hard to structure.",
      "While the 10% baseline tariffs on all U.S. trading partners went into effect on April 5, the reciprocal levies are\u00a0 set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9.",
      "Here's what to know about Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariffs.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Truly reciprocal tariffs would impose the same tax on U.S. imports that other countries charge on American exports on a product-by-product basis. For example, if a country imposed a 6% levy on American-made shoes, Mr. Trump would tax that nation's footwear at the same rate.",
      "Currently, the U.S. and its trading partners charge each other different levies on the same products. Germany, for instance, puts higher tariffs on vehicles made in the U.S. than what Washington, D.C., charges for German vehicle imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal means that if a country has higher tariffs than we do on certain products, we would raise it to that level,\" Alex Jacquez, chief of policy and advocacy at Groundwork Collaborative, a left-leaning public policy think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "But applying tariffs that match other countries' exactly would be an administratively complex task given the tens of thousands of codes that determine the tariff rates on a variety of products, noted Jacquez.",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the\u00a0CBS News app\u00a0on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "\"Setting up reciprocal tariffs across every product category with every trade partner would be completely infeasible with our administrative capacity,\" he said.",
      "Other experts have suggested that Trump's goal behind the levies is less about driving companies to shift their production to the U.S., or generating federal revenue, than about pressuring other nations to strike trade deals with the Trump administration.",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs the same as country-specific tariffs?",
      "Rather than impose perfectly reciprocal tariffs across the board, the White House announced country-specific tariff rates calibrated to their trade imbalances with the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump on April said his administration would impose reciprocal tariffs at roughly half the rate of duties charged by other nations. In calculating the percentage of taxes charged by each nation on U.S. exports, the White House said it included not just levies, but all trade practices on a country-by-country basis that it deemed unfair, including currency manipulation, tariffs and other barriers. Mr. Trump characterized the discounted tariff rates as \"kind.\"",
      "For example, the U.S. said it would match China's 67% rate with a 34% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S. China retaliated last week, saying it would impose its own\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, to which Mr. Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. If Mr. Trump carries through with the threat, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%.",
      "At 50%, Lesotho, an African nation, and French territories Saint Pierre and Miquelon face the highest country-specific tariff rates. Vietnam, where Apple produces some of its iPhones, is subject to a 46% tariff under Mr. Trump's plan.",
      "Jacquez, who formerly worked as an economic policy analyst in the Biden administration, anticipated that the White House would \"come up with a blended rate that is not reciprocal by product, but is reciprocal by saying their tariffs are 10% higher than ours on average, so we'll be imposing 10% tariff across-the-board on all goods.\"",
      "As a result, the U.S. would tax some other nations' products at vastly different rate than they do ours, in a scenario Jacquez predicted would lead to retaliation against the U.S.",
      "\"It will hit a lot of products very differently in a proximate way, because it would be balanced by country but not by import or export,\" Jacquez said. \"That is where complications will arise, and you could see a scenario in which countries retaliate against us.\"",
      "Who are the \"Dirty 15\"?",
      "Trump administration officials have singled out a group of nations they dubbed the \"Dirty 15,\" a reference to the 15% of countries expected to be hit hardest by the new reciprocal tariffs given their trade surplus with the U.S.",
      "Those nations account for \"a huge amount of our trading volume,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on March 18, without naming the trade partners. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett also told Fox News that the White House is targeting 10 to 15 nations with the biggest trade surplus with the U.S. Like Bessent, he also refrained from naming those nations.",
      "Simon MacAdam, deputy chief global economist with Capital Economics, anticipated that likely targets would include leading U.S. trading partners such as China, the European Union and Vietnam. In 2024, the largest U.S. trade deficits around the globe \u2014 meaning countries from which the U.S. imports more than it exports \u2014 were with the following nations, according to federal data:",

      "Sweden ($9.8 billion)",
      "Are reciprocal tariffs likely to drive up consumer prices?",
      "While the levies have not yet gone into effect, experts say any reciprocal tariffs would mean added costs for U.S. businesses, which in turn would likely raise consumer prices\u00a0as companies look to protect their profit margins.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on a business bringing a product into the country. When they receive it at a port of entry, whether it be an airport or seaport, they have to pay the duty to have it admitted into the country,\" Chris Barrett, a professor at Cornell SC Johnson School of Business, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You've just added a cost on for the business, and those costs get passed on, at least to some degree, to consumers.\"",
      "Consumer costs are likely to rise more sharply for products for which there are no comparable substitutes.",
      "\"The more price-insensitive they are, the more likely they are to shoulder the burden of the tax,\" Barrett said.",
      "Prices could also fall later on, if Mr. Trump lowers or removes reciprocal tariffs following trade negotiations, he noted.",

Other Wall Street leaders are also starting to express tariff-related concerns, including billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman.",
      "While many corporate leaders have been notably silent around Mr. Trump's trade policies, Wall Street executives this week spoke critically of the Trump administration's range of tariffs, some of which went into effect over the weekend, following the loss of trillions of value in last week's stock market rout.",
      "In his annual\u00a0letter to shareholders Monday, Dimon warned that Mr. Trump's \"tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\" Dimon's remarks come after he said in January that Americans should \"get over\" concerns about the effects of tariffs.",
      "Dimon, who heads the largest U.S. bank, added in his shareholder letter that while the economy is weakening, stock market \"prices remain relatively high.\" While Dimon did not criticize Mr. Trump directly, he noted that the tariffs would have \"short-term effects\" including anticipated higher prices on both domestic and imported goods.",
      "Such conditions could lead to what's known as stagflation \u2014 a mashup of \"stagnation\" and \"inflation\" \u2014 which describes economic periods when growth slows even as prices remain painfully high. Inflation typically eases when the economy contracts.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" Dimon said.",
      "He said potential retaliatory actions by other nations are weighing on confidence, and said unequivocally that the \"quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse.\"",
      "\"Economic nuclear war\"",
      "A chorus of other high-profile Wall Street executives echoed Dimon's remarks, with some sharply criticizing the White House's recent tariff actions. Many corporate leaders have thus far been reluctant to openly criticize the Trump Administration's agenda.",
      "Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, CEO of Pershing Square, said on X Sunday that \"by placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital.\"",
      "Ackman said that the\u00a0reciprocal tariffs slated to go into effect on dozens of countries April 9 would be tantamount launching \"economic nuclear war on every country in the world.\"",
      "As a result, \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he said.",
      "He took aim at Mr. Trump directly, saying \"The president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe\" and that if he doesn't pause the tariffs from going into effect, the U.S. is headed for a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter.\"",
      "Tariff \"errors\"",
      "Other prominent investors that are chiming in include billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Family Office, who wrote in a\u00a0social media\u00a0post, \"I do not support tariffs exceeding 10%.\"",

That could reduce consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, as well as crimp business investment.",
      "Import taxes are largely borne by businesses, which typically pass on part or much of those added costs to consumers.

      "David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management, thinks U.S. trade officials will eventually lower tariff rates as they negotiate with their counterparts abroad. But that process is likely to take time, and the investment bank doesn't expect a speedy reversal in U.S. tariffs. As a result, UBS economists have lowered their forecast for U.S. economic growth this year to less than 1%.",
      "China strikes back",
      "Investors are also nervously watching as the barrage of U.S. tariffs prompts retaliation from key trading partners. China on Friday said it will impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10.",

    "summary": "As world leaders wrung their hands over President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcements, Argentine president Javier Milei was feted at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "story": [
      "Europe vowed retaliation. China plotted tariffs of its own. Mexico scrambled to blunt the blow. But while the world's leaders were wringing their hands over President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports, Argentina's right-wing president was ebullient, feted at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club.",
      "As part of his enthusiastic outreach to Mr. Trump, Argentine President Javier Milei flew from one of the planet's southernmost nations all the way to Palm Beach for 24 hours to receive an award honoring his libertarian agenda and, he'd hoped, to chat with Mr. Trump, who was also scheduled to attend the right-wing \"American Patriot\" gala.",
      "\"Make Argentina Great Again!\" Milei bellowed from the ballroom stage at at Mar-a-Lago late Thursday.",
      "It would have been the fourth face-to-face meeting between the leaders since Mr. Trump's election victory last November as President Milei, who has imposed a sweeping austerity program to fix Argentina's long troubled economy, offers himself as one of Mr. Trump's strongest allies in the global culture war against the \"woke\" left.",
      "Whether Milei's staunch alliance with Mr. Trump can actually help crisis-stricken Argentina remains to be seen, analysts say.",
      "\"He has a special relationship with Trump that has been good for him politically, but he needs to translate that into being good for the country economically,\" said Marcelo J. Garc\u00eda, director for the Americas at New York-based geopolitical risk consultancy Horizon Engage. \"He hasn't managed to do that yet.\"",
      "Earlier this year, Milei pulled Argentina out of the World Health Organization after the U.S. announced its own exit.",
      "He threatened to quit the Paris climate accord after Mr. Trump did. He outlawed gender change treatments for minors after Mr. Trump banned transgender athletes from participating in women's sports. He even promoted a cryptocurrency token echoing the $Trump memecoin \u2014 at great political cost. In Milei's case, the cryptocoin Libra collapsed and left investors holding the bag, to the tune of $250 million. He later admitted that he posted about the coin without properly vetting the details.",
      "Milei has also slashed government spending, similarly to what Mr. Trump and Elon Musk have done with the Department of Government Efficiency. He has reduced government spending in Argentina by over 30% since taking office in 2023 by eliminating about a dozen government agencies, laying off 10% of the federal workforce and freezing state wages and pensions. While the cuts have lowered the country's hyperinflation, they have pushed up unemployment and poverty rates. Weekly protests have been held criticizing the cuts.",
      "The cuts were something Milei promised while running for office, even wielding a chainsaw during his campaign. He then gifted Musk\u00a0a giant chainsaw modeled\u00a0after the power tool. Musk waved the chainsaw during remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference.",
      "Railing against socialism and feminism at speaking events all over the world \u2014 including at CPAC \u2014 Milei has fashioned himself into something of a MAGA celebrity.",
      "Argentinian government reacts to Trump tariffs",
      "While U.S. partners and rivals alike were criticizing Mr. Trump's tariffs, a tux-clad Milei was holding forth beside a painting of Mr. Trump's pumped fist, reveling in the opportunity to prove himself a dogged champion of the American president.",
      "\"As you can see, we conduct policy with actions, not mere words, and on that we agree with President Donald Trump,\" Milei told the crowd at Mar-a-Lago, drawing cheers at the mention of the American president's name as he spoke in Spanish.",
      "In Buenos Aires, Milei's government sought to reconcile Mr. Trump's major round of tariffs with its own radical libertarian ideology and fervent support for free trade.",
      "\"We do not believe this is an attack on free trade, quite the opposite,\" Milei's spokesperson, Manuel Adorni, said of Mr. Trump's announcement. \"I don't see why there should be so much concern about this.\"",
      "For all the leaders' mutual flattery, Argentina was slapped with a 10% minimum tariff. But officials framed it as uniquely preferential treatment. The front page of Argentina's largest-circulation daily, Clar\u00edn, declared: \"Trump raises the tax on our products less than on other countries.\"",
      "In Washington, Argentine Foreign Minister Gerardo Werthein on Thursday held what he described as \"highly productive\" meetings with top U.S. trade negotiator Jamieson Greer and Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, releasing rosy statements promising that Argentina was on its way to negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.S.",
      "Milei praised progress toward the free deal in his Mar-a-Lago speech. But far more important to the Argentine leader is a hoped-for $20 billion bailout with the International Monetary Fund. The badly needed cash would help Milei keep his ambitious economic reforms on track as pressure mounts on the country's sparse foreign currency reserves.",
      "Milei has already used executive powers to remove the need for Congress to approve a new IMF program. But the loan hasn't cleared the finish line, with negotiators still haggling over how much cash Argentina, a serial defaulter that owes some $44 billion to the fund, will be allowed to access up-front.",
      "It was against this backdrop on Wednesday that Milei, accompanied by his economy minister, hopped on the plane to the U.S., the fund's biggest stakeholder. He told journalists he expected \"an informal meeting\" with Mr. Trump, who was instrumental during his first term in helping Argentina secure a major $56 billion loan from the fund in 2018.",
      "But on Friday, Milei's much-anticipated photo-op with Mr. Trump was nowhere to be found in his publicist's slick montage of the Argentine president snapping selfies with fans on Mar-a-Lago's red carpet.",
      "The president's office said nothing about his meeting \u2014 or, non-meeting \u2014 with Mr. Trump, and did not respond to multiple requests for comment.",
      "Mr. Trump arrived at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach very late Thursday evening after attending an event with professional golfers at one of his golf courses near Miami. The White House didn't say whether he and Milei met.",
      "Major Argentine newspapers cited anonymous officials saying the leaders never met, drawing instant scorn from his political enemies.",
      "\"When I woke up, I thought I'd find on TV the photo-op with your 'friend' Trump that you went looking for,\" left-wing former President Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner wrote on social media. \"What a way to mess around and spend money on nothing.\"",

    "summary": "Wholesale egg prices are falling, with stores saying they're now lowering prices and easing restrictions. But tariffs could be an issue.",
    "story": [
      "When announcing his latest round of tariffs on April 2, President Trump veered into the subject of eggs, noting that prices \"dropped now 59%, and they're going down more, and the availability is fantastic.\"",
      "Wholesale egg prices \u2014 or the price paid by large buyers like grocery stores \u2014 have declined 43% since year start, with much of the decline occurring since Mr. Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. While retail data for March isn't yet available, grocery stores tell CBS MoneyWatch that lower prices are now starting to trickle down to consumers, and that there should be plenty of eggs available for Easter and Passover later this month.",
      "Lower egg prices may represent a bright point for consumers at a time when inflation remains sticky, and\u00a0may reignite\u00a0this year due Mr. Trump's tariffs, economists say. The new levies are set to hit all imports from food products to automobiles. Egg prices have declined partly due to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's five-point plan to tackle the issue, which includes battling the bird flu and importing eggs\u00a0from nations including Turkey and South Korea.",
      "Egg prices at Northeast grocery chain Stew Leonard's have declined recently, with conventional eggs now down to to about $5.99 a dozen from $10 a dozen at their peak in December, said Andrew Hollis, director of sales.",
      "\"We're definitely back to low price eggs again \u2014 there's lot of relief and plenty of supply,\" Hollis told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our demand will go up 40% for Easter, so we're not worried at all and feel like we'll have plenty of eggs on the shelf.\"",
      "Demand for eggs also fell due to the high retail prices at the end of 2024, which caused some households to cut back on buying them, Hollis added. That's allowed farmers to rebuild their supply, he said.",
      "Walmart, one of the nation's biggest grocers, also said that its egg prices have declined in recent weeks, although it didn't specify the decline. A dozen eggs are retailing for about $5 a dozen, according to Walmart's website.",
      "After months of the bird flu impacting egg supplies and prices, egg losses\u00a0due to the disease declined in March, according to a release last week by USDA.",
      "But one issue that could pose a threat to egg prices are Mr. Trump's new tariffs, which will apply import taxes to products from all nations, including Turkey and South Korea, where the U.S. has an agreement to source additional eggs. The nations will face tariffs of 10% and 25%, respectively. Those taxes are likely to be passed onto consumers in the form of higher prices.",

    "summary": "A deal to sell the widely popular platform remains a work in progress.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday said he would sign another executive order to delay enforcement of a law that effectively bans TikTok, amid talks about a possible deal to sell the widely popular platform.",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0signed an executive order on his first day directing the Justice Department to not enforce the ban for 75 days. The order instructed the Justice Department to not take action or impose penalties against \"any entity for any noncompliance.\" The executive order expires Saturday, April 5.",
      "Mr. Trump said Friday he wouldn't enforce the law for at least another 75 days.",
      "\"My Administration has been working very hard on a Deal to SAVE TIKTOK, and we have made tremendous progress. The Deal requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed,\" the president wrote. \"We do not want TikTok to 'go dark.' We look forward to working with TikTok and China to close the Deal.\"",
      "A deal had been reached Wednesday between investors, TikTok's Beijing-based parent company ByteDance and the U.S. government that would have spun TikTok's operations in the U.S. into a new company that was owned and operated by a majority of American investors, according to a source familiar with the plans. The deal allowed ByteDance to keep a minority stake, and Mr. Trump planned to sign an order approving the deal and allowing for a 120-day closing period.",
      "But after Mr. Trump announced sweeping tariffs, ByteDance told the White House on Thursday that China would no longer approve the deal until issues over trade and tariffs were resolved, the source said.",
      "Under a bipartisan law passed last year, ByteDance, originally had until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok or be cut off from U.S. app stores and hosting services.",
      "TikTok\u00a0briefly and voluntarily shut down before the January deadline, but reinstated access to U.S. users after Mr. Trump, who took office one day after the deadline, vowed to take action.",
      "Apple and Google did not\u00a0restore TikTok to their U.S. app stores for nearly a month after Mr. Trump issued the first directive.",
      "Even though Mr. Trump has declined to enforce the ban, the law is still on the books, and companies like Apple and Google could be penalized down the road for violations. But the law provides the authority for the restrictions to be lifted on TikTok in the event of a sale.",
      "When TikTok challenged the law last year, it argued that it never had a choice between divestment or a ban because a forced sale \"is simply not possible: not commercially, not technologically, not legally.\" The Chinese government previously vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm which tailors content recommendations to each user.",
      "In a statement after Mr. Trump's announcement Friday, a ByteDance spokesperson acknowledged the company has been in discussions with the U.S. government about \"a potential solution.\"",
      "\"An agreement has not been executed. There are key matters to be resolved. Any agreement will be subject to approval under Chinese law,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "Mr. Trump suggested last month he could ease tariffs on the Chinese if they approved the deal.",
      "\"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" the president said on March 27. \"Every point in tariffs is worth more than TikTok.\"",
      "But on Wednesday he announced he would impose a 34% additional tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S.",
      "Lawmakers, however, are likely to be dissatisfied if any deal does not fully sever ties between ByteDance and TikTok.",
      "\"If ByteDance stays involved in any way, the deal is illegal \u2014 plain and simple,\" Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House China Committee, said last month.",
      "He said a deal that allows TikTok to continue operating in the U.S. while using ByteDance's algorithm runs afoul of the law because ByteDance would still have access to user data.",
      "\"This setup reeks of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu \u2014 in 2023, through the failed Project Texas, ByteDance tried to create the illusion of better data privacy by storing Americans' data on U.S. servers, all while ByteDance kept its grip on the platform. On the surface, shifting data storage to the United States might have seemed like a reasonable fix, but it ignored the real issue: ByteDance's control over TikTok,\" Moolenaar\u00a0wrote in an opinion piece in the National Review last month.",
      "In 2022, TikTok began an initiative known as \"Project Texas\" to safeguard American users' data on servers in the U.S. and ease lawmakers' fears. But the Justice Department said the plan was insufficient because it still allowed some U.S. data to flow to China.",
      "Moolenaar and Republican members of the China committee said in a statement Friday that they \"stand firm\" in their position.",
      "\"Any resolution must ensure that U.S. law is followed, and that the Chinese Communist Party does not have access to American user data or the ability to manipulate the content consumed by Americans,\" they said. \"We remain committed to enforcing the framework established by Congress to safeguard the American people.\"",
      "During a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing last year, then-Sen. Marco Rubio, who's now secretary of state, explained that U.S. officials viewed TikTok as a national security threat because the algorithm that powers the platform is controlled by a China-based company. The Chinese government, he said, could force TikTok to give it access to the data it collects on tens of millions of Americans or use it to push propaganda to them.",
      "\"TikTok does not work without that algorithm, and that algorithm is controlled by a company that's controlled by the Chinese Communist Party under the law of China,\" Rubio said.",
      "Three Democratic senators\u00a0wrote to Mr. Trump in March asking him to work with Congress to find a long-term solution to TikTok's survival. The senators \u2014 Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and Cory Booker of New Jersey \u2014 said they opposed a TikTok ban, but called it \"unacceptable and unworkable\" for the Trump administration \"to continue ignoring the requirements in the law.\"",
      "TikTok challenged the law in court, but it was rejected by a unanimous Supreme Court days before it took effect. The Supreme Court's decision said the divest-or-ban law does not violate the free speech rights of TikTok or its 170 million users in the U.S., agreeing with the government's position that the platform could be used by China to collect a vast amount of sensitive information on Americans.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Speaker Mike Johnson delayed a vote on a Republican budget plan, lacking enough GOP support to get it over the finish line on Wednesday.",
      "Several House Republicans have resisted increasing pressure from President Trump to swallow a blueprint that's key to extending his tax cuts, which are set to expire this year.",
      "The resolution's passage was in peril heading into the planned vote, making it a gamble for Johnson, who huddled with conservatives off the House floor as the preceding vote was held open for more than an hour while he tried to flip the holdouts. It's the latest setback for Johnson and creates further uncertainty about the future of Mr. Trump's agenda.",
      "Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, said the vote could be rescheduled for Thursday morning.",
      "At a fundraiser for House Republicans Tuesday night, Mr. Trump told GOP holdouts to \"close your eyes and get there.\" Earlier in the day, he met with some of them at the White House, urging them to back the budget resolution adopted by the Senate\u00a0on Saturday.",
      "But more than a dozen members have balked at the low level of spending cuts in the Senate resolution \u2014 just about $4 billion \u2014 compared with the nearly $1.5 trillion in cuts in the House version. The budget resolution serves as a blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities.",
      "\"They have to do this. They have to get there,\" Mr. Trump said at the House GOP campaign arm's fundraising dinner, adding that he had a great meeting with some of the holdouts, but \"just in case there are a couple of Republicans out there \u2014 you just got to get there. Close your eyes and get there. It's a phenomenal bill. Stop grandstanding.\"",
      "The president criticized Democrats on their policies, but admired the fact that \"they always vote in unison,\" saying, \"you don't see somebody that's holding up.\"",
      "\"One little thing the Republican Party has to do is get together and damn vote,\" Mr. Trump said, adding that individual lawmakers may not get \"every little ounce \u2014 it doesn't work that way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who's played a key role in shepherding the House GOP on legislation in recent months, promised a \"massive victory\" in the 2026 midterm elections if Republicans follow through on the budget resolution and enact his agenda more broadly. He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",

      "\"Republicans, it is more important now, than ever, that we pass THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,\" he said. \"The USA will Soar like never before!!!\"",
      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",
      "\"I will not vote for this bill,\" Roy said. \"Because it is not responsible.\"",

      "The tariff rate of 10% includes the European Union. It's unclear what will happen after the 90-day period concludes, while countries negotiate with the Trump administration. Previous tariff rates on steel, aluminum and auto imports remain unchanged, a White House official said.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote: \"Conversely, and based on the fact that more than 75 Countries have called Representatives of the United States, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, and the USTR, to negotiate a solution to the subjects being discussed relative to Trade, Trade Barriers, Tariffs, Currency Manipulation, and Non Monetary Tariffs, and that these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States, I have authorized a 90 day PAUSE, and a substantially lowered Reciprocal Tariff during this period, of 10%, also effective immediately.\"",
      "Speaking to reporters during a race car event at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, the president was asked to explain how he reached a decision to issue the pause.",
      "\"Well, l thought that people were jumping a little bit out of line, they were getting yippy, you know?\" the president said. \"They were getting a little bit yippy, a little bit afraid, unlike these champions.\"",
      "\"I was watching the bond market,\" he added. \"The bond market is very tricky. I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's, it's beautiful. The bond market right now is beautiful. But yeah, I saw last night where people were getting a little queasy.\"",
      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt reiterated Mr. Trump's insistence that he wasn't considering an extension or delay.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",
      "The so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs above the baseline 10% worldwide rate went into effect Wednesday.",
      "\"It's unfolded exactly the way it should. It's a beautiful thing,\" said top White House adviser Peter Navarro on Fox Business Channel.",

In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the orders harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the firings unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",

More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that it was unlawful for Mr. Trump to fire them. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",

The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",

We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",

      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

    "story": [
      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",
      "\"The tariff clouds parted for the first time today, but it's too soon to know how sunny the skies will be tomorrow \u2014 or 90 days from now,\" said Daniel Skelly, head of Morgan Stanley's Wealth Management Market Research & Strategy Team, in an email.",
      "Worst-hit countries",
      "Before he announced the pause, Asian nations were set to face the worst of the brunt, with Cambodia facing a tax rate at 49% and Vietnam at 46%, according to Nationwide Chief Economist Kathy Bostjancic.",
      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",
      "If the tariffs are maintained by the Trump administration and if other nations impose retaliatory tariffs, both the U.S. and other countries \"will suffer serious recessions,\" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "China retaliated by saying it planned to impose a retaliatory\u00a034% import fee\u00a0on American products, followed by Mr. Trump retaliating with plans to impose an additional 50% tariff on its imports and China ratcheting up its rate to 84%.",
      "Full list of Trump's reciprocal tariffs by country",
      "When do these tariffs go into effect?",
      "The reciprocal rates went into effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 9. That's in addition to a baseline 10% tariff which took effect at 12:01 a.m. on April 5.",
      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",
      "Mr. Trump said his administration determined the tariff rate for each country based on the monetary levies those nations charge on U.S. imports, as well as non-monetary trade barriers like regulations that make it tougher for American products to enter those markets.",
      "The president added that the reciprocal tariffs are still only half the rates charged by those nations on U.S. products, characterizing his new levies as \"kind.\"",
      "Are other countries retaliating against U.S. tariffs?",
      "Yes. China said it would impose a\u00a034% tariff on imports\u00a0of all U.S. products starting April 10, and then raised the level to 84%. The Chinese Commerce Ministry also said it would implement tighter restrictions on exports of rare earths \u2014materials used in products such as computer chips and electric vehicle batteries \u2014 as well impose 27 additional U.S. companies to trade sanctions.",
      "\"This is an aggressive, escalatory response that makes a near-term deal to end the trade war between the two superpowers highly unlikely,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a research note.",
      "The European Union announced on April 9 tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including beauty products, soybeans and motorcycles, according to AFP.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill in recent days, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",

    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judges in New York and Texas temporarily blocked the deportations of certain Venezuelan migrants facing removal under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. addressed health program cuts and the measles vaccine in his first network TV interview since joining the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "In his first network TV interview since becoming Health and Human Services secretary under the Trump administration, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spoke with CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook about the measles vaccine, major government cuts and health care costs.",
      "LaPook met with Kennedy in Mesa, Arizona, where he visited a native health center as part of a three-state tour to promote the Trump administration's \"Make America Healthy Again\" agenda, which includes overhauling standards for food processing.",
      "\"FDA needs to start regulating food again and saying, you know, not just when food is adulterated, when there's bacteria in it, let's look at the chemicals in it,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Cuts to health programs and staffing",
      "Since his appointment in February, Kennedy has facilitated sweeping cuts affecting a wide range of\u00a0programs and employees.",
      "When asked by LaPook if he personally approved the more than $11 billion proposed in cuts to local and state programs that address infectious disease, mental health, addiction and childhood vaccination, Kennedy said, \"No I'm not familiar with those cuts. We'd have to go \u2026 the cuts were mainly DEI cuts, which the president ordered.\"",
      "LaPook provided Kennedy with an example of a $750,000 University of Michigan grant focused on adolescent diabetes, which was eliminated.",
      "\"I didn't know that, and that's something that we'll look at,\" Kennedy said. He added that he could not speak to if it should be considered a DOGE cut.",
      "\"I just, I'm not familiar with that particular study. But there's a number of studies that were cut that came to our attention and that did not deserve to be cut, and we reinstated them. Our purpose is not to reduce any level of scientific research that's important.\"",
      "Around\u00a010,000 HHS employees\u00a0are being laid off in a restructuring move by Kennedy and Elon Musk's\u00a0DOGE. The secretary acknowledged that some of the DOGE cuts will\u00a0need to be reinstated.",
      "\"HHS's job is to make America healthy, and we're spending $1.9 trillion a year, and people are not getting healthy. ... What Elon said is that, when you do a disruption of this, a lot of times, 80% of the people that get cut ... You may make mistakes, as much as 20[%], and then you go back and remedy that.\"",
      "With billions of dollars in cuts at stake, Kennedy addressed the cost of health care.",
      "\"People have a choice about how sick they are going to be, many people. If you don't have any choice, then we should give you all the resources that you want, but I mean... it's a moral question too, and it's a philosophical question,\" the secretary said. \"If you're smoking three packs of cigarettes a day, should you expect society to pay when you get sick?\"",
      "Measles vaccine",
      "For decades, Kennedy has been a vaccine skeptic and promoted false claims that vaccines cause autism. But now, Kennedy told CBS News he encourages people to get the measles vaccine.",
      "\"The federal government's position, my position, is that people should get the measles vaccine, but ... the government should not be mandating those,\" he said.",
      "Kennedy had previously said the measles vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the virus from spreading, but until now had stopped short of recommending it.",
      "Yet he also continued to raise\u00a0doubts, despite decades of research and extensive testing that backs up the effectiveness and safety of vaccines.",
      "\"When I say they're not safety tested, what I mean is they're not adequately \u2014 many of the vaccines are tested for only three or four days with no placebo group,\" Kennedy said. \"I always said during my campaign and every part, every public statement I've made: I'm not gonna take people's vaccines away from them. What I'm gonna do is make sure that we have good science so that people can make an informed choice.\"",
      "The growing multi-state measles outbreak has hit Texas the hardest. As of Tuesday, the state reported more than 500 confirmed measles cases since January and two deaths in unvaccinated children, ages 6 and 8.",
      "Following the death of the second child\u00a0from measles-related causes, Kennedy traveled to Gaines County, Texas, posting on X that he was there \"to comfort the Hildebrand family after the loss of their 8-year-old daughter Daisy.\"",
      "As of April 3, the CDC has reported 607 confirmed measles cases\u00a0in more than 20 states, including Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Washington.",
      "The outbreak centered in West Texas has primarily impacted children and teens, most of whom were unvaccinated or have an unknown vaccination status.",

      "Kathleen Walters, the IRS chief privacy officer, Teresa Hunter, IRS chief financial officer, and Mike Wetklow, IRS chief risk officer, are also leaving the agency, two sources familiar with the situation said. Walters' departure is through the Deferred Resignation Program as well and is related to the Department of Homeland Security-data sharing agreement, one source said.",
      "Late Monday, the IRS disclosed its memorandum of understanding with the Department of Homeland Security in a court filing in a lawsuit filed by Public Citizen, which seeks to bar the Treasury Department from disclosing tax return information to immigration enforcement authorities.",
      "According to the exhibit, the IRS will review all requests and account for disclosures made under the memorandum. While some of the memo is highly redacted, it reveals that the IRS will disclose to ICE the names and addresses of immigrants, among other information.",
      "The new data-sharing arrangement will allow ICE to cross-verify the names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally with their IRS tax records.",
      "Treasury argues that the agreement will help carry out President Trump's agenda to secure U.S. borders and is part of his larger nationwide immigration crackdown, which has resulted in deportations, workplace raids, and the use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants.",
      "Advocates say the IRS-DHS information sharing agreement violates longstanding privacy laws and diminishes the privacy of all Americans.",
      "A Treasury official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to explain the agency's thinking on the agreement said the basis for the agreement is founded in \"longstanding authorities granted by Congress, which serve to protect the privacy of law-abiding Americans while streamlining the ability to pursue criminals.\"",
      "Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, told reporters at the Border Security Expo in Phoenix on Tuesday that the agreement would help ICE find people who are collecting benefits they aren't entitled to and are \"kind of hiding in plain sight\" using someone else's identity.",
      "Working with Treasury and other departments is \"strictly for the major criminal cases,\" Lyons said.",
      "The IRS has already been called upon once to help with immigration enforcement earlier this year.",
      "Noem in February sent a request to Bessent to borrow IRS Criminal Investigation workers to help with the immigration crackdown, according to a letter obtained by The Associated Press. It cites the IRS' boost in funding, though the $80 billion infusion of funds the federal tax collection agency received under the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act has already been clawed back.",
      "Tax law experts for the NYU Tax Law Center wrote Monday that the agreement \"threatens to violate the rights that many more Americans have under longstanding laws that protect their tax information from wrongful disclosure or dissemination.\"",

Prosecutors said Routh hoped to purchase the .50 caliber rifle at a gun show, but his contact was ultimately not able to locate the type of gun Routh wanted until after the assassination attempt at the golf course.",
      "Routh is suspected of hiding in some bushes with a gun near Trump International, about 300-500 yards away from Mr. Trump, who was then the Republican presidential nominee, while he was playing golf in West Palm Beach in September 2024.

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang using a seldom-invoked wartime authority, but clarified that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review.",
      "The high court split 5-4 in granting a request for emergency relief sought by the Justice Department in the dispute over President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to swiftly remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang without a hearing. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined with the three liberal justices in criticizing the majority's decision.",
      "In its unsigned decision, the Supreme Court said the detainees who are challenging their removals under the Alien Enemies Act are confined in Texas, so the venue for their case is \"improper\" in the District of Columbia, which is where the dispute has been considered.",
      "\"As a result, the government is likely to succeed on the merits of this action,\" the court said in its ruling lifting two temporary restraining orders issued by a federal district judge in Washington that prevented removals under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "It added that going forward, detainees subject to the 1798 law \"must receive notice\" that they face removal under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "\"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court said.",
      "The federal district court issued an order last month that prevented the government from deporting the migrants under the 220-year-old law while legal proceedings move forward, and the administration asked the Supreme Court to lift that order.",
      "The decision from the high court to do so comes amid rising tensions between the president and the judiciary, as Mr. Trump's second-term policies have collided with the federal courts. More than 100 cases that challenge key aspects of his agenda have been filed across the country, and disputes challenging at least six of the president's actions have so far reached the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority.",
      "The ongoing fight over Mr. Trump's effort to summarily deport Venezuelan migrants is one of the most high-profile of the cases, and the district court's decision temporarily blocking the removals sparked calls from the president and his GOP allies for the judge presiding over the dispute to be impeached.",
      "In its decision, the court said the opinion confirms that detainees subject to removal orders under the Alien Enemies Act are entitled to notice and a chance to challenge their deportation.",
      "\"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. For the reasons set forth, we hold that venue lies in the district of confinement,\" it said.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor issued a scathing dissent joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, and joined in part by Barrett. She called the majority's legal conclusion \"suspect\" and accused the Trump administration of largely ignoring \"its obligations to the rule of law.\"",
      "\"The government's conduct in this litigation poses an extraordinary threat to the rule of law. That a majority of this court now rewards the government for its behavior with discretionary equitable relief is indefensible. We, as a nation and a court of law, should be better than this,\" Sotomayor wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Brett Kavanaugh highlighted the area of agreement among the court. All nine justices, he wrote, agree that judicial review is available. But he said they split as to where that review should take place.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on social media after the ruling, \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem cheered the ruling with a warning to migrants in the U.S. unlawfully, saying in a statement, \"leave now or we will arrest you, lock you up and deport you.\"",
      "Lee Gelernt, a lawyer with the ACLU who argued before the lower courts, told CBS News, \"We are disappointed that we will need to start the court process over again in a different venue, but the critical point is that the court rejected the government's remarkable position that it does not even have to give individuals meaningful advance notice to challenge their removal under the Alien Enemies Act. That is a big victory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump signed a proclamation under the Alien Enemies Act last month, claiming that Tren de Aragua is \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion\" against the U.S. and declaring that all members of the gang in the U.S. unlawfully were subject to immediate detention and removal. The law had previously been invoked three times, and only during declared wars.",
      "The day after Mr. Trump's proclamation, five Venezuelan nationals who were being held at a detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act violated the terms of the law and asked a federal district court in Washington, D.C., to block their removals.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg swiftly agreed to stop their deportations for 14 days and later expanded his temporary order to prohibit the administration from removing all noncitizens in U.S. custody who are subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation. The judge allowed deportations under other legal authorities. A hearing on a request for a longer preliminary injunction is set for April 8, though it's unclear whether that will proceed as scheduled.",
      "Boasberg is also separately examining the circumstances surrounding the removal of 137 people under the Alien Enemies Act who were on planes bound for El Salvador while proceedings unfolded. The deportations raised questions as to whether the Trump administration violated an oral order from Boasberg calling for any planes carrying migrants subject to removal under the law to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration appealed Boasberg's temporary order, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit last month\u00a0declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations. The appeals court divided 2-1 in turning down the government's request to halt Boasberg's directive.",
      "In the emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act grants the president sweeping national security authority.",
      "The district court's order, she argued in a filing, is \"forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans. Those orders \u2014 which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "The administration also reiterated its request that the Supreme Court step in to curb the temporary restraining orders that have been issued by federal judges and block enforcement of a policy nationwide.",
      "\"Here, the district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "But lawyers for the Venezuelan migrants accused the president of stretching the limits of the Alien Enemies Act, which they said risked allowing the government to \"immediately begin whisking away anyone\" it unilaterally claims is a member of a criminal gang to a foreign prison.",
      "\"The president's effort to shoehorn a criminal gang into the AEA, on a migration-equals-invasion theory, is completely at odds with the limited delegation of wartime authority Congress chose to give him through the statute,\" they wrote in a filing.",
      "They also argued that many of the people flown out of the U.S. to a Salvadoran prison are not members of Tren de Aragua, and at least eight were Venezuelan women who were returned to the U.S.",
      "Allowing the deportations to resume would have devastating consequences for their clients, the lawyers said. Already, 130 Venezuelan men have been sent to El Salvador, where they have been \"confined, incommunicado, in one of most brutal prisons in the world, where torture and other human rights abuses are rampant,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Without the TRO, plaintiffs will suffer extraordinary and irreparable harms \u2014 being sent out of the United States to a Salvadoran prison, where they will remain incommunicado, potentially for the rest of their lives, without having had any opportunity to contest their designation as gang members,\" lawyers for the migrants said.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court comes as the justices are considering a separate request from the Trump administration to lift a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador to the United States.",
      "The man, Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, was among those on the deportation flights at issue in the case involving the Alien Enemies Act, but he was removed under a different immigration law. Chief Justice John Roberts earlier Monday temporarily paused the district court's order that set an 11:59 p.m. Monday deadline for the government to return Abrego Garcia from El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. But the same day,\u00a0three flights\u00a0carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men \u2014 137 of whom were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "The March 15 order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court\u00a0on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\u00a0to lift the lower court orders.",
      "On Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court cleared the way for the administration to resume deportations using the law, but said that individuals subject to removal are entitled to judicial review.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation. Top White House officials had argued migrants subject to deportation under the law are not entitled to due process. But, the Supreme Court said on April 7 that going forward, Alien Enemies Act detainees must receive notice \"that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" and the notice must allow them to challenge their detention.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "story": [
      "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 China said Tuesday it would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.'s imposition of \"so-called 'reciprocal tariffs'\" on China was \"completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.\"",
      "China, the world's second-largest economy, has imposed retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.",
      "\"The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,\" the ministry said. \"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\"",
      "CBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens and economists have warned that the odds of a global recession are rising fast.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.",
      "\"If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" the president wrote on his own Truth Social platform. \"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\"",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union.",
      "European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called on China to negotiate with the EU to come up with solutions to the global challenges presented by the sweeping U.S. tariffs.",
      "During a phone call with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday, Von der Leyen \"stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field,\" according to a statement from her office.",
      "The statement said the leaders had discussed establishing a mechanism to track any diversions of goods caused by the U.S. levies on trade, amid concern in Europe that China could try to divert cheap exports that had been destined for the U.S. to the EU market. Such diversions could amount to what is called \"dumping\" in international trade, a practice that can saturate a market with underpriced goods at the expense of domestic producers and sellers.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014\u00a0The Senate's\u00a0budget resolution, which has been backed by President Trump and is key to extending his tax cuts, is opposed by a number of House Republicans who say it doesn't cut enough spending.",
      "The House must adopt the Senate-passed resolution to move forward on the president's agenda, and GOP leaders hoped to take that vote this week. But nearly a dozen House Republicans say they oppose the resolution or have serious concerns about the $1.5 trillion gap between the House and Senate versions. Speaker Mike Johnson's\u00a0slim\u00a0GOP majority means he can afford to lose the support of just three Republicans.",
      "The president met with Republican holdouts on Tuesday as Johnson tries to coax them to back the 70-page resolution, the blueprint for implementing Mr. Trump's border security, defense, energy and tax priorities. Although Johnson has in the past been able to overcome pockets of opposition, this time, the Louisiana Republican faces objections from multiple corners of the GOP conference.",
      "Johnson said he thought Mr. Trump helped change some minds. \"The president was very helpful and engaged. We had a lot of members whose questions were answered,\" the House speaker said after the White House meeting, adding that they're \"making great progress.\"",
      "But several holdouts said they didn't attend the meeting \u2014 or weren't invited.",
      "House leaders aren't ruling out working through the weekend if they're unable to push the resolution through the lower chamber this week. Congress is scheduled to be in recess the next two weeks.",
      "The president endorsed the Senate-adopted budget resolution Monday night, saying in a post on Truth Social that it includes all of \"the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT.\"",
      "\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" Mr. Trump continued, adding that \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"",
      "He continued to put pressure on the holdouts in a Tuesday post that said, \"I AM FOR MAJOR SPENDING CUTS! WE ARE GOING TO DO REDUCTIONS, hopefully in excess of $1 Trillion Dollars.\"",
      "But many of the holdouts want assurances that there will be much more than $1 trillion in cuts.",
      "The budget plan is the first step in the reconciliation process, which allows Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate.",
      "The Senate adopted the compromise resolution Saturday after Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year. But both chambers must adopt identical budget resolutions to kickstart the broader reconciliation process, prompting GOP leaders to come together on the path forward in recent weeks.",
      "Still, the resolution doesn't address disagreements over where and how to make substantial spending cuts, pushing a confrontation further down the road.",
      "In the resolution, the Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans argue the spending cuts aren't deep enough.",
      "The Senate's plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing current policies incurs no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "But the tax cuts were originally passed using \"current law\" scoring, which treats the renewal of expiring policies as new legislation. The House budget resolution relied on the current law baseline and acknowledges that continuing the tax cuts will cost $3.8 trillion. The 2017 Trump tax cuts are set to expire this year, and if they are not extended, taxes will go up for many filers.",
      "House Republican leaders are still barreling forward with the Senate-adopted plan, meeting with skeptical Republicans, while the White House seeks to apply pressure of its own.",
      "Johnson met with the House Freedom Caucus Monday night, after the conservative group's chairman, Rep. Andy Harris of Maryland, advocated for the chamber to move forward on the president's agenda without the budget resolution.",
      "\"It needs to at some point in the future. It doesn't need to be right now,\" Harris said of the resolution's adoption.",
      "Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas also advised against holding a vote this week.",
      "\"They literally produced a budget that will have deficits going up,\" Roy said Tuesday. \"That's what they did. I didn't come here to make deficits go up. The Senate apparently did.\"",
      "House Majority Leader Steve Scalise acknowledged the hurdles ahead at the GOP leadership's news conference Tuesday morning, saying \"nobody said it would be easy.\" But the Louisiana Republican added that \"our commitment is firm in getting this done.\"",
      "\"There are members that have questions \u2014 that's not a surprise,\" Scalise said. \"Our job is to continue answering those questions while moving the ball forward. But it's critical that we advance this agenda, that we don't delay, because passing the budget doesn't end the process, it starts the reconciliation process.\"",

    "summary": "The executive orders are meant to reenergize the coal industry, which has been steadily declining for years.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump signed four executive actions on Tuesday aimed at reversing policies that transitioned the country away from coal production and aimed at boosting America's \"beautiful clean coal industry,\" as the White House put it.",
      "The actions are meant to help the U.S. achieve affordable and reliable energy by \"slashing unnecessary regulations,\" Mr. Trump said. The president said he's using the Defense Production Act to \"turbocharge\" coal mining in America. Mr. Trump also said his administration is working through the legalities of making it harder for companies to shut down coal plants.",
      "\"Today, we're taking historic action to help American workers, miners, families and consumers,\" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room, flanked by men in coal mining uniforms and hard hats. \"We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all. And it wasn't just Biden, it was Obama, and there were others. But we're doing the exact opposite. And all those plants that have been closed are going to be opened.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has had a long affinity for coal, as previous Democratic administrations and many developed nations have worked to move away from the fossil fuel toward renewable resources. The term \"clean coal\" typically refers to processes designed to reduce emissions from coal-fired power plants, but environmental groups say any coal combustion is harmful.",
      "The president's move Tuesday defines coal as a \"mineral,\" which the administration says will give it more leeway on its use. The government has traditionally classified it as a nonrenewable fossil fuel. One of the executive orders directs agencies to lift barriers to coal mining on federal lands and prioritize coal leasing, formally ending an Obama-era moratorium against coal leasing on federal land. The president also directed federal agencies to rescind any policies transitioning the country away from coal production.",
      "Another executive order the president signed Tuesday is meant to promote grid reliability, including by using fossil fuels. And yet another executive order Mr. Trump signed Tuesday directs the Justice Department to investigate states that are discriminating against coal.",
      "\"For years, people would just bemoan this industry and decimate the industry for absolutely no reason, because with modern technology and all of the other things that we do, it's one of the great, great forms of energy,\" Mr. Trump said Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has expressed a desire to harness U.S. coal, along with oil, natural gas and nuclear power, and this executive order is one of a number of actions he has taken to reverse Obama and Biden administration energy policies. The president has also withdrawn the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement, and declared a national emergency on energy, and he ended predecessor Joe Biden's efforts to encourage widespread EV adoption.",
      "The president said coal miners want to mine coal, not work in high-tech jobs or other fields.",
      "\"You could give 'em a penthouse on Fifth Avenue and a different kind of job, and they'd be unhappy,\" Mr. Trump said, with the miners behind him. \"They want to mine coal. That's what they love to do.\"",
      "But despite Mr. Trump's emphasis on coal in his first term, coal production decreased slightly between 2016 before he took office and 2020, his final full year in office, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And, in keeping with a trend in declining coal employment, there were fewer Americans working in the coal industry in January 2020 ahead of the COVID-19 pandemic than there were in January 2017 when he took office, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "No new coal plant has come online since 2013, during the Obama years, and the average age of the current fleet is 53 years old. Currently,\u00a0coal makes up about 16%\u00a0of the electricity mix in the U.S., down from 50% two decades ago.",
      "As of this year, only about 41,000 Americans work in the coal industry. By comparison, solar energy employed nearly 280,000 Americans in 2023, according to the National Solar Job Census.",
      "Environmental groups suggested Mr. Trump's executive order to reinvigorate coal will be a step backward.",
      "\"What's next, a mandate that Americans must commute by horse and buggy?\" Kit Kennedy, managing director for power at the National Resources Defense Council, said in a statement.",
      "\"Trump's coal orders take his worship of dirty fossil fuels to a gross and disturbingly reckless new level,\" said Jason Rylander of the Center for Biological Diversity's Climate Law Institute. \"Forcing old coal plants to keep spewing pollution into our air and water means more cancer, more asthma and more premature deaths.\"",

      "The U.S. will impose a 104% tariff on China beginning at 12:01 a.m. EDT Wednesday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a briefing Tuesday.",
      "Starting tomorrow, the White House will begin collecting steep levies on imported goods from China, as President Trump follows through on a threat issued against Beijing on Truth Social Monday.",
      "Mr. Trump on Monday threatened to slap an additional 50% tariff on imports from China after the nation said it would impose a 34% import fee on American products. China's retaliatory move came after Mr. Trump said China would face a 34% tariff on all goods imported to the U.S., a rate tailored specifically to China.",
      "Mr. Trump also said in his Truth Social post that the U.S. would cease all negotiations with China, while proceeding with trade talks with other nations.",
      "China's commerce ministry on Tuesday asserted that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if Mr. Trump did not walk back his latest threat.",
      "In the press briefing Tuesday, Leavitt said retaliatory tariffs on roughly 90 countries were designed to open negotiations with the U.S.'s trade partners.",
      "\"To countries around the world, bring us your best offers and he will listen,\" Leavitt said of Mr. Trump. \"Deals will only be made if they benefit American workers.\"",
      "She added that 70 nations have already approached the White House to begin negotiations and presumably lower their assigned tariff rates in exchange for concessions that Mr. Trump deems beneficial to the U.S.",
      "\"On the other hand, countries like China, who have chosen to retaliate, and try to double down on their mistreatment of American workers are making a mistake,\" Leavitt said.",
      "She also reiterated Mr. Trump's \"firm belief\" that the U.S. needs to prioritize the bringing of manufacturing back to the U.S.",
      "\"President Trump has a spine of steel and will not break,\" she said, later adding that \"a strong America cannot be solely dependent on foreign countries for our food, medicines and critical minerals.\"",
      "Critics of Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including some prominent Wall Street figures, say levies could stoke inflation and slow the U.S. economy.",
      "\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders Monday.",
      "Economists are also raising the odds of the U.S. economy entering a recession on Mr. Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement, with Goldman Sachs analysts on Monday putting the odds of the economy entering a recession within the next 12 months at at 45%, up from 35% in its previous forecast.",

      "The figure has been growing ever since a lengthy civil fraud trial ended with Mr. Trump, two of his sons and a former Trump Organization executive ordered to pay back $364 million in disgorgement for \"ill-gotten gains\" and $100 million more in interest dating back years.",
      "They appealed the February 2024 judgment but interest has continued to build, at a rate of more than $114,000 per day. The total for all defendants hit $500 million on Dec. 29.",
      "That figure is now nearly $512 million, and Mr. Trump's personal share \u2014 98% of the total judgment \u2014 was at $500,070,167.42 on Tuesday morning, according to a spokesperson for New York Attorney General Letitia James, who brought the case against Trump and others.",
      "James's office has said the judgement reflects the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud. The defendants were accused of a multi-year scheme to cheat banks and insurers by inflating property valuations and estimates of Mr. Trump's wealth.",
      "James declined to comment Tuesday. Attorneys for Mr. Trump did not reply to requests for comment.",
      "Judge Arthur Engoron said evidence proved \"over and over again\" that the defendants provided \"blatantly false financial data\" to Mr. Trump's business partners. Engoron concluded that the scheme allowed Mr. Trump and his company to gain massive windfalls through deal terms that they wouldn't have otherwise gotten.",
      "Mr. Trump blamed his employees and others during several hours of testimony in November 2023. Trump said on the stand that his company \"underestimated\" the value of his properties, because the value of his brand was not being factored into the estimates at the heart of the case.",
      "He claimed the case was brought in order to tarnish his reputation.",
      "Soon after the judgment, Trump and his co-defendants brought the case to New York's Appellate Division, First Department. In September, at least two of five justices on the appeals panel appeared skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 GOP Rep. Don Bacon is building support for a bill to return more control of tariffs to Congress after President Trump's\u00a0far-reaching new tariffs\u00a0caused days of economic and political turmoil since he announced them last week.",
      "\"It's time that Congress restores its authorities here,\" the Nebraska Republican said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" and he told Brennan, \"I have some beginning support on the House side.\"",
      "Bacon argued that the Constitution is clear on the issue, giving Congress \"the power of tariffs and taxes, and we gave some of that power to the executive branch,\" which he called a \"mistake.\"",
      "Bacon's bill is companion legislation to a measure introduced in the Senate last week by Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The Trade Review Act of 2025 would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to cancel the tariff with a joint resolution.",
      "\"We have a total of seven Republicans in the Senate,\" Bacon said, adding that he plans to unveil his House bill, with some beginning support, on Monday.",
      "Bacon thinks the legislation will be difficult to pass in the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority, but he believes that there are scenarios that would ease its path.",
      "\"I think if we get 60 votes in the Senate, they'll put pressure on the House to look at this,\" Bacon said. \"And if we continue to see the stock market go a certain direction, or if we see inflation or unemployment shift in a bad way, I think then this bill becomes a very viable bill.\"",
      "On Sunday, the White House Budget Office said Mr. Trump would veto an attempt to curb his tariff power.",
      "Mr. Trump announced 10% tariffs on imports from all countries last week, as well as higher levies effective this week on dozens of countries that have trade surpluses with the U.S. Meanwhile, the president urged Americans to \"hang tough\" as financial markets saw their worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "Bacon said the bill \"will not pass tomorrow or maybe in the next couple weeks, but this will be in the queue that we can use.\"",
      "Cantwell, who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said seven Republicans signed on as cosponsors on the first day the Senate measure was introduced.",
      "\"So, usually you don't get first introduction and get so many people on board, but I think it shows the anxiety that people have,\" Cantwell said, while noting that industry groups have also backed the effort.",
      "But whether the measure will get a vote in the GOP-led Senate remains to be seen. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 2 Senate Republican who also appeared on \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday, said the Senate legislation \"will get a thorough hearing.\"",

      "Tattoos of crowns, a clock and other symbols have been used by the Trump administration to allege Venezuelan men deported from the U.S. are members of the Tren de Aragua gang. But experts and police in a Colorado city who have investigated the gang say tattoos aren't reliable markers of affiliation.",
      "The administration alleges the deportees it sent to El Salvador's notorious maximum security prison are gang members, mostly with Tren de Aragua, and some with MS-13. It has also acknowledged that \"many\" of them have no criminal records.",
      "President Trump invoked the 1798 wartime Alien Enemies Act, claiming Tren de Aragua is invading the United States, to deport many of the men. The administration also declared Tren de Aragua a terrorist organization.",
      "Court documents, lawyers and family members of some of the migrants have said their tattoos were reasons they were determined to be alleged Tren de Aragua members.",
      "The wife of Franco Jose Caraballo, a barber from Venezuela with no criminal record, said officers kept asking questions about his tattoo of a pocket watch that marks the time of their daughter's birth.",
      "A lawyer for Caraballo says he's not a gang member and his wife said he is innocent when asked what worries her about his detention in the Salvadoran prison.",
      "Another man, Andry Jos\u00e9 Hern\u00e1ndez Romero, has crown tattoos over the words \"Mom\" and \"Dad.\" Hern\u00e1ndez Romero is a makeup artist who identifies as gay. He faced discrimination and threats in Venezuela because of his sexual orientation and political views and was seeking asylum in the U.S., his attorney said in a court filing.",
      "A questionnaire, used in correctional facilities to assess potential gang affiliation, appears to show that Hern\u00e1ndez Romero's tattoos were the only basis to allegedly connect him to Tren de Aragua.",
      "\"The crown has been found to be an identifier for a Tren de Aragua gang member,\" an officer wrote in the filing.",
      "Many experts disagree that tattoos can identify members of the gang.",
      "\"Expert after expert tells us tattoos are not a reliable indicator of whether you're part of this particular gang,\" Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union attorney who is leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act, told 60 Minutes.",
      "Rebecca Hanson, an assistant professor of sociology and criminology at the University of Florida, wrote in a court filing for the case that there are no tattoos, symbols or hand gestures associated with the group.",
      "\"The TdA, and gangs more generally in Venezuela, do not have a history of using tattoos to indicate membership,\" she said. \"TdA members may, of course, have tattoos, but this is not part of a collective identity.\"",
      "In Aurora, Colorado, which Mr. Trump has claimed is a \"war zone\" overrun by the Tren de Aragua, Police Chief Todd Chamberlain said it's very difficult to identify Tren de Aragua members.",
      "Chamberlain said he would not describe the city as a \"war zone,\" but said Aurora has been \"ground zero\" for the gang's activities. The city saw organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes, one of which is now shuttered.",
      "The Aurora Police Department likely has the best understanding of the Tren de Aragua gang of any U.S. law enforcement agency, he said.",
      "\"It's unlike MS-13, it's unlike a Crip or a Blood,\" he said. \"If you go back to gangs in the early '80s or the '90s again, the way they walked, the way they talked, what they wore, they had very obvious signs.\"",
      "But Tren de Aragua does not, he said.",
      "Rather than focusing on trying to identify gang members, Chamberlain said his department has focused on criminal activity.",
      "\"For us, it wasn't about what gang they were involved in. It's about what criminal activity they were involved in, and we knew that there was criminal activity,\" he said. \"If we could connect it to TdA as we were evolving this process, that's great.\"",
      "Chamberlain said his department counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "Jeanette Rodriguez, who serves as a liaison between local law enforcement and the Venezuelan migrant community in Aurora, said Tren de Aragua members don't flaunt obvious signs of gang membership.",
      "\"If you compare it to like MS-13, they're very proud of who they are, and they would tattoo them on their faces, and are very proud of who they are. Tren de Aragua, they know the value of laying low,\" she said.",
      "Hanson noted that the Trump administration's partial reliance on tattoos to conclude migrants are members of Tren de Aragua \"appears to result from an incorrect conflation of gang practices in Central America and Venezuela.\"",
      "It's different than in El Salvador and Honduras, where \"gangs have long used tattoos to indicate membership and identity,\" she said.",
      "At CECOT, the El Salvador prison, many of the inmates have prominent tattoos. One, Marvin Vazquez, who is an MS-13 member, said \"you gotta kill\" to get a tattoo like the \"MS\" ones he showed on his chest and abdomen.",
      "Vazquez was arrested in El Salvador after the government declared war on the gangs in 2022.",
      "Gustavo Villatoro, El Salvador's minister of justice and public security, said tattoos are one way the government identifies gang members. He said not all the prisoners in CECOT have been convicted of crimes.",
      "Top White House officials have argued the Trump administration does not need to follow due process to remove individuals from the U.S. under the\u00a0Alien Enemies Act. However, on Monday, April 7, the Supreme Court said detainees must receive notice that they are subject to removal under the law and must be allowed to challenge their detention.",
      "Asked if he was worried some migrants were incorrectly identified as gang members, Mr. Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan said he's not.",

    "summary": "More than 16,000 probationary workers at six different agencies were fired in mid-February.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to halt a lower court order that required six federal agencies to rehire more than 16,000 probationary workers who had been fired.",
      "The high court granted a request for emergency relief from the Trump administration, which sought to move forward with its efforts to drastically scale back the size of the federal government as legal proceedings continue. In an unsigned order, the Supreme Court said the injunction issued by the district court in mid-March \"was based solely on the allegations of the nine non-profit-organization plaintiffs in this case. But under established law, those allegations are presently insufficient to support the organizations'\" legal right to sue, a concept known as standing.",
      "Its stay will remain in place will litigation plays out. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson said they would have denied the Justice Department's request for relief.",
      "Probationary workers, generally those who were still in one or two-year trial periods, were the early targets of mass firings that are part of President Trump's government-cutting initiative. Many have been left in limbo since mid-February, when they were fired and then had their employment restored weeks later as a result of court orders.",
      "Labor unions and nonprofit groups that brought the lawsuit challenging the firings vowed to continue fighting for probationary workers.",
      "\"There is no doubt that thousands of public service employees were unlawfully fired in an effort to cripple federal agencies and their crucial programs that serve millions of Americans every day,\" the coalition said in a statement. \"Today's order by the U.S. Supreme Court is deeply disappointing but is only a momentary pause in our efforts to enforce the trial court's orders and hold the federal government accountable.\"",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after thousands of probationary workers received notices that they had been terminated. The letters, many of which used similar language, based the firings on individual performance, though federal workers argued in court filings that they had received positive performance reviews.",
      "In response to the firings, a group of labor unions and nonprofit organizations filed a lawsuit in federal district court in California. The lawsuit claimed that the Office of Personnel Management directed the mass terminations of probationary workers, acting outside of its authority.",
      "In late February, U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued a temporary restraining order deeming earlier guidance from OPM to federal agencies about the firing of probationary workers \"illegal\" and invalid. The judge also concluded that the mass firings were likely unlawful.",
      "On the heels of that decision, OPM acting director Charles Ezell issued revised guidance clarifying that it is \"not directing agencies to take any specific performance-based actions regarding probationary employees.\"",
      "Following a hearing last month, the judge ordered six agencies \u2014 the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior, Treasury and Veterans Affair \u2014 to immediately offer reinstatement to all probationary workers who were fired the previous month.",
      "Human resources officials at the half-a-dozen agencies told the court that they had rehired the fired employees and placed them on administrative leave before returning them to full-duty status.",
      "The Justice Department asked a federal appeals court to pause that decision while it appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined the request.",
      "In an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris argued that the district judge did not have the power to grant reinstatement to thousands of probationary workers, and refuted that OPM had directed the firings in the first place.",
      "\"An order directing reinstatement of thousands of employees across six agencies is intolerable,\" she wrote in a filing. \"The injunction appears to prevent the agencies from terminating the employees based on an exercise of the agencies' independent judgment \u2014 and would even seem to prevent the employees' termination based on newly arising grounds like new instances of poor performance or misconduct without, at a minimum, obtaining permission from the district court.\"",
      "The acting solicitor general, who represents the government before the Supreme Court, told the justices that Alsup's order is a \"profound invasion\" of the executive branch's ability to direct its internal affairs.",
      "She also warned that the reinstatements have posed logistical burdens that require significant resources, and said that the obligation to pay the fired probationary employees \"inflicts massive financial costs\" that cannot be recovered.",
      "\"Each day the preliminary injunction remains in effect subjects the Executive Branch to judicial micromanagement of its day-to-day operations,\" Harris wrote.",
      "But the unions and organizations challenging the firings said that the harms alleged by the government are self-inflicted.",
      "\"While the government complains that the reinstatement of more than 16,000 employees at the six covered agencies is an 'enormous' task that would interfere with agency functioning (without presenting evidence supporting that assertion), the scale of the task is simply a reflection of the scale of the Government's own unlawful action and its 'move fast and break things' ethos,\" lawyers for the challengers wrote in a filing.",
      "They called OPM's directives \"hasty and sloppy,\" and said that the government can still fire employees, as long as it complies with the law.",
      "\"The district court's reinstatement merely orders the government to return to the situation that existed before it embarked on illegal mass termination of probationary employees,\" the legal team for the unions and nonprofits wrote. \"If there are 'practical burdens' associated with the return to the status quo, they are of the government's own making.\"",
      "The case brought by the unions and groups is one of two challenging the mass firings of probationary workers. A group of 19 states filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Maryland arguing the terminations were unlawful, and in March, a judge ordered affected probationary workers at more than a dozen agencies be reinstated.",
      "The judge then granted a preliminary injunction in early April, which applies to probationary workers at 20 agencies who live or work in the states involved in the lawsuit.",

      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",
      "The dwelling where it was found had anthropomorphic figures with tassels in red tones, a detail from the Teotihuacan culture, according to the ministry's statement.",
      "The\u00a0researchers published their findings in the archaeological journal Antiquity.",
      "The researchers made their announcement less than a year after a hidden Mayan city was\u00a0discovered in a dense Mexican jungle by a doctoral student who unknowingly drove past the site years ago on a visit to Mexico.",
      "Tikal National Park is about 325 miles north of Guatemala City, and the discovery site is guarded and there are no plans to open it to the public. Tikal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, reached its peak between 200 and 900 AD when Mayan culture encompassed parts of what are now Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.",
      "Teotihuacan, famous for its pyramids of the sun and the moon, is located about 25 miles northeast of Mexico City. That culture reached its peak between 100 and 600 AD.",

    "summary": "Colossal Biosciences said it used ancient DNA from the extinct species to create three dire wolf pups named Romulus, Remus and Khaleesi.",
    "story": [
      "For the first time ever, scientists say they have made a species de-extinct, bringing the dire wolf back into the world thousands of years after it died off.",
      "Colossal Biosciences, a company based in Dallas, says it successfully birthed three dire wolves \u2014 a species that once roamed North America but has been extinct for more than 12,500 years \u2014 using revolutionary science.",
      "Colossal CEO Ben Lamm said the team used DNA from a 13,000-year-old tooth and a 72,000-year-old skull to analyze the full genome of the species and create three healthy dire wolf puppies, according to a news release.",
      "The Colossal website explains that many dire wolf fossils were preserved in the La Brea tar pits, in the Los Angeles area, but the species' DNA was not preserved in the tar.",
      "But using two dire wolf samples from an international study on the extinct species, Colossal was able to uncover more dire wolf DNA that ever previously found. Company scientists were eventually able to analyze the species' genome \u2014 or its entire DNA set.",
      "Then they used CRISPR, a gene-editing technology, to genetically modify cells from a living gray wolf. Usually, cloning relies on tissue samples, but Colossal was able to use these modified cells to create embryos, then transferred them to a surrogate (a domestic dog, The Associated Press reported) to grow.",
      "Three litters of dire wolf puppies yielded two males, named Romulus and Remus, and a female, named Khaleesi after the \"Game of Thrones\" character \u2014 a nod to the HBO fantasy drama that featured dire wolves.",
      "However, critics say the physical and genetic resemblance to an extinct species falls short of a full revival.",
      "\"All you can do now is make something look superficially like something else,\" Vincent Lynch, a biologist at the University at Buffalo who was not involved in the research, told the AP.",
      "\"Whatever ecological function the dire wolf performed before it went extinct, it can't perform those functions\" in today's environment, Lynch said.",
      "The company says the animals are being cared for on a 2,000-acre preserve, \"certified by the American Humane Society and registered with USDA,\" enclosed by a 10-foot-tall fence and perimeter security.",
      "Colossal was also able to create two litters of cloned red wolves, which are the most critically endangered wolf in the world.",
      "The company says its de-extinction process could help support conservation efforts globally. \"Preserving, expanding, and testing genetic diversity should be done well before important endangered animal species like the red wolf are lost,\" said Harvard geneticist and co-founder of Colossal, Dr. George Church.",
      "In 2021, Colossal announced plans to de-extinct the woolly mammoth \u2014 a concept Church had been developing for years. He told \"60 Minutes\" in 2019, \"I would say that probably in five years we'll know whether we can get this to work for mice, and maybe pigs and elephants. And then if we can get embryos to grow in the laboratory all the way to term, then it's probably a decade.\"",
      "Last month, the company said its scientists have simultaneously edited seven genes in mice embryos to create mice with long, thick, woolly hair \u2014 dubbing its creation\u00a0the \"Colossal woolly mouse.\"",
      "While the results and images of the the shaggy-haired mice were posted online, Colossal did not publish its research in a peer-reviewed journal and it has not been vetted by independent scientists.",
      "The scientists edited mouse genes related to their hair and fat metabolism \u2014 two qualities woolly mammoths needed to survive in their Arctic habitat. After confirming the gene modification process works in mice, they planned on testing it with elephants, which are woolly mammoth's closest living relatives. But, since Asian elephants are endangered, the company will face a number of additional hurdles. It is also doing work aimed at protecting the world's\u00a0elephant populations.",

    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",

    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",
      "Along with three high-end professional cameras, the crew was equipped  with multiple laptops and tablets, a ham radio \"and even an X-ray  generator, which we'll use to capture the first-ever X-ray image of the  human body in space \u2014 something crucial for future long-duration  missions to Mars and beyond,\" Chun posted on X.",
      "Throughout the flight, the crew posted spectacular videos, including a timelapse view of Earth below as the Crew Dragon sailed over Antarctica all the way to the North Pole, making the trip from one pole to the other every 46 minutes.",
      "\"Proud to be able to bring to space some incredible cameras and lenses capturing the first images of the Arctic and Antarctic shot by humans from space,\" Mikkelsen posted on X. \"These videos are BIG in file size and we look forwards to sharing them with you post-mission splashdown.\"",
      "Another video showed the entire state of Florida and the southeastern United States. Zooming in on the Kennedy Space Center, Chun marveled \"there's our launch pad. Oh my God!\"",

    "summary": "Churchill, Manitoba, a small village on the Hudson Bay, is known as the polar bear capital of the world.",
    "story": [
      "Just on the edge of the western Hudson Bay lies the small town of Churchill, Manitoba.",
      "Here, the sea meets the boreal forest under the rippling northern lights. Farther to the north, the trees stop growing. Snow coats a harsh landscape of Canadian shield, and the ceaseless wind cuts through the willows.",
      "No roads lead to Churchill. Just a rail line and an airport runway, carrying the occasional charter plane.",
      "But it attracts tourists and scientists alike because for a short time in the fall, the kings of the arctic migrate through town back to their homes on the frozen sea ice. Travelers come here, from all over the world, seeking one thing: to lock eyes with a polar bear.",
      "The bears",
      "Polar bears meander through Churchill every autumn as they wait for ice on the bay to form. Males take to the ice first, roaming and testing out the edges, eager to travel north where they can finally hunt for the ringed seal \u2013 their primary food source.",
      "Scientists converge on Churchill because it is the most accessible point to study polar bears. The bears here are the most researched in the world, and the most photographed.",
      "These arctic beasts have big personalities: they play and cuddle and nap to pass the time. Males will often spar, trying to get to know each other so that they're prepared for the charged battles in the spring, during mating season.",
      "Cubs stay close to their mothers for two to three years before they're chased off and forced to live on their own. For the following year, they test the waters \u2013 sometimes struggling to survive as they learn to hunt and sustain themselves in the tundra.",
      "\"A stark change in the ecosystem\"",
      "In recent years, however, the warming arctic is melting their habitat on the ice, changing the bears' behavior: scientists from Polar Bears International say the ice is forming two weeks later than it was in the 1980s, and receding two weeks earlier in the spring.",
      "This monthlong change in their environment is forcing bears to keep to shore longer, closer to humans and farther from the seal lairs in the north.",
      "It's a change \u2014 sparked by the altering climate \u2014 that their parents and grandparents didn't have to face. Yes, the bears have been constantly evolving, ever since they diverged from the grizzly roughly 500,000 years ago, but the pace of change is what is alarming scientists.",
      "Chief climate scientist for Polar Bears International Flavio Lehner says because of the decline in sea ice, the polar bear population in the western Hudson Bay is as low as 618, approximately half of what it used to be in the 1980s.",
      "\"That's quite profound,\" he says. \"It's hard to find other places, other than maybe that have been deforested in the Amazon, where you see such a stark change in the ecosystem caused by climate change.\"",
      "Lehner doesn't anticipate that the situation will improve, and beyond the population decline, he's seeing a behavioral shift as well. It used to be much more typical to find mothers with triplets, which, in his personal experience, is now rare.",
      "Scientists at Polar Bears International say that these bears can only sustain themselves comfortably on land for 180 days. In other parts of the world, bears have been seen hunting birds and reindeer, but scientists say this high-protein diet can damage their kidneys, and doesn't stop them from losing 2-4 pounds a day when they're off the ice.",
      "\"The current pace of change is operating too fast,\" explained John Whiteman, chief research scientist with PBI. \"Polar bears won't be able to evolve or acclimate in time to be able to deal with our current rate of sea ice loss.\"",
      "Whiteman expects that the polar bears will stick around for the next 10 years or so in Churchill, but the timeline starts to get fuzzy 20 to 30 years into the future.",
      "\"We ultimately know if we lose sea ice, we lose polar bears,\" said Whiteman.",
      "The town",
      "Churchill has always been a town at the precipice. It's lived many lives \u2014 from home to First Nations to trading post to military town to now, the polar bear capital of the world.",
      "It attracts a special type of person. Often one that finds pleasure in the solitude. The people who come for employment are semi-nomadic tourist industry workers, or maybe they're looking for a change. They're guides and nature enthusiasts, seasonal workers attracted to this slow, simpler pace of life.",
      "Others \u2014 like the town's mayor of 30 years Mike Spence \u2014 have spent their lives here. Back when he was a kid, conservation officers in town were shooting 20 to 22 bears a year. But over time, the approach has changed.",
      "\"First of all, we respect wildlife,\" he says. \"The polar bears are quite significant in the Indigenous world \u2013 it's at the top of its food chain. There's a lot of respect in that.\"",
      "The town is now facing a future where the polar bear tourist season could potentially disappear. In the interim, the community will be forced to coexist more closely with the bears as they wait for the ice to form on the bay. And as infrastructure too struggles to adapt to a warming climate and melting permafrost, Spence is one of the many people looking for solutions.",
      "\"We've always been challenged,\" Spence says. But the community also \"usually finds a way.\"",
      "Those solutions include taking command of a port and rail line that collapsed in 2017 due to a combination of flooding and lack of maintenance. Once it starts operating at its full potential, the hope is that it will welcome more consistent jobs and resources for the community. Meanwhile, a new program in town grows microgreens, and new polar bear-resistant trash containers dot the streets, all to forge a sustainable path forward in the north for people, and the wildlife.",
      "\"What we need to do now is build on our young people growing up here, so that they play a bigger role in building a stronger community, and a bigger community,\" Spence says. \"They see for themselves what they've got is pretty precious.\"",
      "Fighting for a future",
      "On the outskirts of town, Wyatt Daley hooks up his sled dogs, preparing to lead the first of three tours for the day. Fall is peak tourist season, and he'll spend the day out among the trees of the boreal forest, gliding on the snow.",
      "Churchill relies on the tourism that comes from those wanting to see the polar bears. In order to sustain their businesses, some tourism companies are looking to pivot to protect their futures.",
      "One of these ways is by advertising other aspects of this wild north \u2013 the aurora that dances overhead 300 nights of the year and the annual beluga whale migration in the summer.",
      "But it's not just the economic engine that needs to be fueled: there's a yearning for families and the next generation to choose Churchill, tend to it and savor everything it has to offer.",
      "Wyatt Daley was one of those children who, years ago, begged his parents to move further south. His father Dave, a dog musher and tourism company owner, would shake his head and tell him, \"We have the dogs, this is where we make our living.\" And that was the end of that particular conversation.",
      "He watched his friends and their families move away \u2013 especially in the middle school years \u2013 searching for \"better opportunities.\" After graduation, he traveled throughout the world, working in the tourism industry in Australia and Cologne. But he came home. Back to the dogs, and back to Churchill.",
      "Churchill, he says, has given him \"everything.\" He feels a connection to the dogs, to the land. His father is his best friend. And that's exactly what he wants for his own son Noah \u2013 now 3 years old \u2013 who has an affinity for the dogs, too.",
      "\"I remember being a little kid and standing on the back ski with my dad and doing tours,\" he says. \"That's what I'm looking forward to most right now . . . I think about [Noah] coming out and doing tours with me.\"",
      "But this legacy is threatened by the warming arctic, and it's a weight the Daleys feel as they fight to protect their way of life in the north.",
      "\"It's a scary thought to think the polar bears may not be here one day,\" Dave Daley says. \"The planet earth is a living being, and we're the ones treading on it and changing everything. I think we really need to get a handle on it and start taking this seriously.\"",

    "summary": "The craft carrying astronaut Jonny Kim and two Russian cosmonauts docked with the space station. They're scheduled for an eight-month stay.",
    "story": [
      "Jonny Kim, a former Navy SEAL, Harvard Medical School graduate and now a NASA astronaut, blasted off with two cosmonaut crewmates aboard a Russian Soyuz rocket early Tuesday, chased down the International Space Station and moved in for a picture-perfect docking three hours after liftoff.",
      "With veteran commander Sergey Ryzhikov, 50, at the controls, flanked on the left by rookie cosmonaut Alexey Zubritsky, 32, and on the right by Kim, 41, the Soyuz MS-27/73S ferry ship rocketed away from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1:47 a.m. EDT (10:47 a.m. local time).",
      "\"The crew is feeling good, everything is nominal,\" Ryzhikov periodically assured Russian flight controllers as the rocket climbed toward orbit.",
      "Eight minutes and 46 seconds later, the third stage engine of the Soyuz 2.1a rocket shut down and the crew ship was released to fly on its own, followed moments later by deployment of its two solar panels and navigation antennas.",
      "The ferry ship then carried out an automated rendezvous with the space station, moving in for docking at the multiport Prichal module at 4:57 a.m. as the two spacecraft sailed 260 miles above western Russia.",
      "\"Congratulations, Sergey, congratulations on your arrival at the International Space Station,\" Russian mission control radioed. After extensive leak checks to verify an airtight structural seal, hatches were opened at 7:28 a.m., allowing Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim to float into the station.",
      "Welcoming them aboard were Soyuz MS-26/72S crewmates Alexey Ovchinin, Ivan Vagner and NASA astronaut Donald Pettit, along with SpaceX Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.",
      "\"It was the trip of a lifetime and an honor to be here,\" Kim told flight controllers during a traditional postdocking video conference.",
      "Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are replacing Ovchinin, Vagner and Pettit, who were launched to the ISS on Sept. 11 and who plan to return to Earth aboard their own Soyuz on April 19 to wrap up a 219-day stay in space.",
      "The Crew 10 fliers, launched on March 14, replaced their Crew 9 predecessors \u2014 Nick Hague, cosmonaut Alexander Gorbunov and Starliner astronauts Butch Wilmore and Sunita Williams \u2014 who returned to Earth on March 18.",
      "Rotating space station crews have typically carried out, on average, six-month tours of duty aboard the lab complex. But starting with Kim's flight, the Russians are increasing Soyuz durations to eight months to gather more data on the effects of long-term stays in space.",
      "As such, Ryzhikov, Zubritsky and Kim are expected to return to Earth around Dec. 9.",
      "In a pre-flight interview with CBS News, Jonathan Yong \"Jonny\" Kim, the son of South Korean immigrants and a father of three, said he first heard of the Navy's SEALs when he was 16 years old. He eventually joined the elite corps and went on to participate in more than 100 combat operations as a member of SEAL Team Three in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.",
      "\"To me, it is the strongest calling I've ever had in my life, even to this day,\" he said. \"I've had additional callings in life. But it was really that first calling I had to be a SEAL that I will remember for the rest of my life. Because it was the first time that I felt I had a purpose, and I had a dream.\"",
      "That dream was to serve as a warrior.",
      "\"Back then, I used to have a really narrow focus on that,\" he said. \"But to me, a warrior is someone that is in continued pursuit of excellence in their craft. It doesn't have to be combat. It can be in medicine. It can be as a NASA astronaut. It can be in politics. It can be anything.",
      "\"But it's someone who's passionate and in pursuit of continued excellence. And the reason why it just resonated so well with me is because it was everything I wasn't at the time, but I wanted to be.\"",
      "Kim said he had \"some terrible moments\" in combat and ended up \"just really burnt out. I was very burnt out from the combat, from the war and the loss. ... I needed a way to continue serving, and it seemed logical that medicine would be that vehicle.\"",
      "Already a veteran combat medic, Kim was accepted in Harvard Medical School. Along the way, he said, he \"probably went a little too extreme in ensuring that previous successes did not set myself up for the future.\"",
      "\"I ensured that the people I worked with in the hospital didn't know I was previously a SEAL, because I wanted my patients, I wanted my colleagues to think of me as dependable and proficient and a good physician. Not because I used to be a SEAL, but because that's who I was.\"",
      "Then, as he was wrapping up medical school and preparing for his residency, Kim watched the initial test flight of NASA's Orion moonship in 2014 on YouTube and became a self-described \"space nerd.\" He met physician and former astronaut Scott Parazynski, who encouraged him to apply to NASA for astronaut training.",
      "Out of 18,000 applications for the class of 2017, NASA chose 12, including Kim.",
      "He said learning Russian was the most challenging aspect of training to fly aboard a Soyuz, but added that his crewmates spoke excellent English and had gone out of their way to welcome him aboard.",
      "\"We are friends. I mean, we're very, very professional,\" Kim said. \"We work well together. ... I've had Alexey and Sergey over for dinner and they've done the same thing for me. So our relationships are personal and there's a lot of trust and friendship there.",
      "As for being assigned to a Soyuz flight, riding a vehicle that's been around for decades as opposed to the roomier touchscreen-equipped SpaceX Crew Dragon, Kim said he was more than happy to fly with the Russians.",
      "\"I just love technology (but) there's also something to be said about reliability, or as the saying goes, 'If it's not broke, don't fix it,'\" he said. \"The amount of testing and the reliability the Soyuz has shown over decades is unsurpassed and is absolutely admirable.\"",
      "During the course of his stay aboard the station, Kim said, he hopes to venture outside the lab for a spacewalk at some point, but added he would be more that happy to serve in any capacity.",
      "\"The modern day astronaut is a jack of all trades,\" he told CBS News. \"You know, we train to do spacewalks. We train to support space walks, train to do research. One day we might be plumbers or mechanics, we might be technicians repairing a radio or we might be pipetting various fluids into other fluids for research.",
      "\"So it's kind of all of the above, whatever the demands that the space station need at a time.\"",

      "The awe-inspiring experience won't happen in the U.S. again until 2044, with only three states in the path, and 2045, with more than a dozen states in the path.",
      "\"A total solar eclipse is one of the most spectacular things anyone can see in their lifetime,\" Virginia Tech astrophysicist Nahum Arav told CBS News. The eclipse \"looks like a black hole in the sky,\" said Arav, who watched the paths of totality of eclipses in 1991 and 2017.",
      "The 2024 eclipse started on the Pacific Coast of Mexico, and then moved into Texas.

      "Even with spotty weather in some states, millions of people from coast to coast saw a partial solar eclipse, in which the moon partially covers the sun. However, only those within the path of totality experienced the darkness of the total solar eclipse.",
      "When is the next total solar eclipse in the U.S. after the 2024 eclipse?",
      "Solar eclipses happen about twice a year, said Arav. \"Eclipses happen all over the Earth evenly,\" he told CBS News \u2014 but noted the timings when they occur are not regular. That means\u00a0eclipses can occur within just a few years, or every few decades, in North America.",
      "Before the eclipse in 2024, the last total solar eclipses visible from the U.S. were in 2017 and\u00a01979. The 2017 solar eclipse was the first whose path of totality crossed the entire continent in 99 years.",
      "Even though eclipses may seem to occur randomly, scientists can pinpoint exactly when and where they will happen.",
      "\"There is no ambiguity, as we know exactly where it will land,\" said Arav.",
      "There will be eight total solar eclipses visible from parts of the continental U.S. in the 21st century, Arav said, with one occurring about every 12 years, on average.",
      "The next one is predicted to occur on Aug. 23, 2044, NASA said. However, the path of totality from this eclipse will only touch three states, according to\u00a0The Planetary Society, a nonprofit organization dedicated to public interest in space.",
      "This next eclipse will mainly be observed in Canada, Arav said.",
      "Path of totality for the 2044 total solar eclipse",
      "The 2044 eclipse will start in Greenland on Aug. 23, 2044, and will continue its path through Canada.",
      "The total solar eclipse will be short, mostly appearing in Canada. It will be visible from just three states in the U.S.: Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota.",
      "The path of totality will cross Williston and Dickinson, North Dakota, and Great Falls, Montana.",
      "Path of totality for the 2045 total solar eclipse",
      "The next solar eclipse that crosses a significant portion of the continental U.S. will be in 2045, said Arav. That year, a solar eclipse on Aug. 12 will darken skies in parts of the U.S., Haiti, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Guyana, French Guiana, Suriname and Brazil.",
      "It will be visible in many states as it moves from coast to coast. The eclipse will start in California and move east to end in Florida, similar to 2017, Arav said.",
      "There will be numerous U.S. cities where eclipse watchers can view the total eclipse, including Reno, Nevada; Colorado Springs, Colorado; Tulsa, Oklahoma; Little Rock, Arkansas; Jackson, Mississippi; and Orlando, Florida.",

    "published": "Fri, 04 Apr 2025 14:48:24 -0400",
    "summary": "SpaceX's third all-civilian privately chartered flight was the first to carry a crew into polar orbit.",
    "story": [
      "A wealthy bitcoin entrepreneur and three fellow adventurers plunged back to Earth aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule Friday, splashing down in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of southern California to close out the first crewed flight around Earth's poles.",
      "Three-and-a-half days after launch Monday from the Kennedy Space Center \u2014 and after 55 passes above the North and South Poles \u2014 the Crew Dragon \"Resilience\" fired its braking rockets at 11:26 a.m. EDT and slammed back into the discernible atmosphere about 25 minutes later.",
      "Enduring heat shield temperatures up to 3,500 degrees Fahrenheit, the spacecraft rapidly slowed down, deployed four big red-and-white parachutes and settled to an on-target 16-mph splashdown at 12:19 p.m.",
      "SpaceX crews deployed nearby rushed to the gently bobbing capsule and rigged it for a lift onto the company's recovery ship Shannon.",
      "In the first test of its kind, the crew exited the craft on their own, demonstrating the ability to get out of a Crew Dragon without help from recovery crews.",
      "Unlike crews returning from long-duration flights to the International Space Station who are carried out of their capsules, mission commander Chun Wang and his three companions were able to lift emergency gear up and out of the hatch before climbing out themselves.",
      "While they moved a bit gingerly after three-and-a-half days in weightlessness, Chun, Norwegian cinematographer Jannicke Mikkelsen, Rabea Rogge, a German robotics specialist, and Australian polar guide Eric Philips were all smiles as they greeted support personnel and were escorted into the recovery ship for initial medical checks.",
      "Chun is a Chinese-born citizen of Malta who lives mostly in the extreme north of Norway, most recently in Svalbard, a Norwegian archipelago in the Arctic Ocean where he first met his crewmates, all veterans of polar expeditions.",
      "\"We ... all met on Svalbard, and we love the ice,\" Chun posted on X during the flight. \"The mission was planned when I lived there, and we fly polar because, in an ISS-like orbit, we are unable to see where we live. From this perspective, the mission has perfectly achieved its goal.\"",
      "Chun said before launch he planned to be on the lookout for Antarctic research stations, but Mikkelsen said during the flight that \"unlike previously anticipated, from 460 km above, it is only pure white, no human activity is visible.\"",
      "Neither Chun nor his crewmates are licensed pilots. While Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin has launched non-pilot crews to the edge of space in sub-orbital New Shepard flights, no crew has flown to orbit without at least one member with aviation expertise or astronaut experience.",
      "But the Crew Dragon is highly automated and can be controlled from the ground when necessary. SpaceX viewed the Fram2 flight as a stepping stone toward opening the door for more non-professionals to fly to orbit.",
      "Chun, an avid world traveler and polar visitor, paid SpaceX an undisclosed amount to charter Resilience for the trip to polar orbit, SpaceX's third privately funded civilian space tourism flight.",
      "The mission was named Fram2 in honor of a 19th century sailing ship \u2014 Fram, or \"forward\" in Norwegian \u2014 that carried arctic explorers to the poles. A small piece of the original ship's teak decking was carried into space aboard the Crew Dragon.",
      "\"My own journey has been shaped by lifelong curiosity and a fascination with pushing boundaries,\" Chun said before launch. \"As a kid, I used to stare at a blank white space at the bottom of a world map and wonder what's out there.",
      "\"Curiosity eventually took me across the continent and to the southern most tip of Earth in 2021, and also the North Pole in 2023. ... Fram2 isn't just about going to space. It's about pushing boundaries, sharing knowledge ... and we hope our mission will further inspire later people to do the same.\"",
      "The crew planned to carry out 22 experiments during the flight, ranging from filming auroral displays from orbit to testing compact exercise equipment for use in smaller spacecraft, growing oyster mushrooms in microgravity and taking the first X-rays in space.",

    "story": [
      "Meta whistleblower Sarah Wynn-Williams told senators in testimony Wednesday on Capitol Hill that the social media company worked \"hand in glove\" with the Chinese government to censor its platforms, according to her written remarks obtained by CBS News.",
      "Wynn-Williams began working at Meta, then known as Facebook, as the director of Global Public Policy in 2011. In her almost seven years at Meta, Wynn-Williams says she witnessed the company provide \"custom built censorship tools\" for the Chinese Communist Party, allow user data, including that of American users, to be accessed by the CCP, and remove the account of a Chinese dissident.",
      "Wynn-Williams alleged in her written remarks that Meta's artificial intelligence model known as \"Llama\" was used to help DeepSeek. DeepSeek is a Chinese AI company that sent shockwaves through the American technology industry earlier this year when its AI model was shown to be competitive with OpenAI's ChatGPT at a fraction of the cost.",
      "In response, a Meta spokesperson called Wynn-Williams' testimony \"divorced from reality and riddled with false claims.\"",
      "\"While Mark Zuckerberg himself was public about our interest in offering our services in China and details were widely reported beginning over a decade ago, the fact is this: we do not operate our services in China today,\" Meta said in a statement.",
      "In a statement last year, Meta spokesperson Andy Stone wrote, \"The alleged role of a single and outdated version of an American open-source model is irrelevant when we know China is already investing over 1T to surpass the US technologically, and Chinese tech companies are releasing their own open AI models as fast, or faster, than US ones.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Counterterrorism, announced the hearing last week.",
      "Meta, which changed its name from Facebook in 2021, operates some of the most popular social media platforms in the United States, including its previous namesake Facebook as well as Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads.",
      "The hearing comes as Washington takes a more aggressive posture toward China and its growing threat to American economic interests and national security. The Trump administration is set to implement 104% tariffs on goods from China in early hours Wednesday. In 2023, the House of Representatives created the Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party to investigate China's challenge to American global power.",

    "story": [
      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",
      "An April 3 analysis from Rosenblatt Securities found that the Cupertino, California-based company could raise iPhone prices by 43% to offset the effects of reciprocal tariffs.",
      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

He was charged with one count of unlawful possession of a firearm and was ordered detained by a magistrate judge, pending future hearings.",

He argued \"they will not be able to even touch your seat,\" and he predicted they'd pick up \"40, 50, or even 60\" seats in the House, an outcome that would defy conventional political dynamics, with the party in control of the White House often losing control of the House in the midterms.",
      "\"If we don't get it done because of stupidity or a couple of people that want to show how great they are, you just have to laugh at them or smile at them or cry right in their face,\" the president continued.",

      "Congressional leaders are pushing to get the budget plan adopted this week before they leave town for a two-week recess. Adopting the budget resolution marks the first step in the reconciliation process, a maneuver that enables Congress to bypass the 60-vote threshold required to advance most legislation in the Senate and pass the measure with a simple majority. It will allow Republicans to approve the legislation funding the president's agenda without support from Democrats.",
      "After Republicans in the House and Senate had forged ahead on their own budget blueprints earlier this year, the Senate on Saturday adopted the compromise resolution, giving the House just days to overcome opposition and get it over the finish line before the recess. And while GOP leaders came together on the path forward in recent weeks, the approach has frustrated many House Republicans.",
      "The Senate set relatively low minimum floors for spending cuts for several committees, at just about $4 billion dollars, though they expect to find far more. At the same time, it allows for House plans to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending. On top of that, the Senate-adopted plan relies on a budget scoring method known as \"current policy,\" which assumes that continuing the expiring current policies will incur no cost. Under that baseline, the $3.8 trillion it would cost to extend the Trump tax cuts would not be counted.",
      "The Trump tax cuts were originally passed in 2017 using a \"current law\" baseline, and they were set to expire this year. This scoring method, which was also used in the House budget resolution, means that the $3.8 trillion cost to extend the tax cuts is counted as new spending.",
      "Fiscal hawks have criticized the Senate-backed plan, including Rep. Eric Burlison, a Missouri Republican, who told reporters Tuesday that \"there's no way\" the House adopts it at this point. Burlison said he could be convinced by a guarantee that the Senate will make deeper spending cuts, calling the levels currently outlined in the resolution \"anemic\" and \"a joke.\"",
      "GOP Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, when asked if he'd consider backing the measure if he had assurances on spending cuts from the president, told reporters he would have to \"see some product from the Senate that actually shows that they're serious about cutting.\"",
      "Crane called the pressure from House GOP leadership to fall in line on the resolution to avoid jeopardizing the president's agenda \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"I think it's just another tactic to try and pressure us into the status quo,\" he added.",
      "During the House Rules Committee hearing on the resolution Wednesday, House Budget Committee chairman Jodey Arrington, a Texas Republican, said he has \"concerns\" about the Senate's resolution guiding the reconciliation process.",
      "Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican, reiterated during the meeting that \"the math still doesn't math.\"",
      "\"The Senate budget is all tax cuts and no spending cuts,\" Roy said, adding that he doesn't trust a promise from the Senate to cut spending.",
      "Roy said his message to the Senate and House GOP leaders, along with the White House, is to \"come show me the math.\"",
      "\"I will not vote for this bill,\" Roy said. \"Because it is not responsible.\"",

      "Sitting atop the Yankee Hill neighborhood in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is Ascent, a 284-foot luxury apartment building made mostly of wood. The first of its kind, Ascent is also the tallest timber-concrete hybrid building in the world.",
      "Tim Gokhman, one of the developers of Ascent, says building costs are comparable to more traditional structures, but he found that building with wood has advantages over steel and concrete.",
      "\"Concrete is imprecise, it's labor intensive, and it has a heavy carbon footprint,\" Gokhman said. \"Steel has advantages. It can span much better than concrete and mass timber, but it's even heavier, and it has the heaviest carbon footprint.\"",
      "Manufacturing both steel and concrete comes at a cost to the environment, with steel generating 7% of all global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "Ascent was built using pre-fabricated pieces of wood glued together, forming mass timber. It's strong, light and cheaper to produce than steel and concrete. It took a crew of only 12 workers just six months to construct Ascent's core.",
      "When asked if we have enough trees to make our cities more mass timber friendly, Gokhman said, \"I think we do. The largest cause of deforestation is a lack of demand for forest products, which causes our forest to be converted to industrial, agricultural, residential uses.\"",
      "It's also easy to deconstruct and recycle. But for all its advantages, wood has one real disadvantage: it burns. That's why Ascent beams were sent to the U.S. Forest Services' forest products laboratory at the University of Wisconsin.",
      "Before Ascent was even built, its timber was tested in a furnace at the lab, where temperatures can reach over 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Once it's cooled, engineers will be able to see just how much and how deep the char got, giving them an idea of its fire resistance rating.",
      "Laura Hasburgh, materials research engineer at the lab, found that while Ascent's mass timber burned, it burned slowly enough to meet building codes.",

      "The president said he \"did a 90-day pause for the people that didn't retaliate.\"",
      "Bessent said he expects the number of countries trying to negotiate with the U.S., which is over 75 now, to climb even higher.",
      "\"President Trump wants to be personally involved,\" Bessent said in explaining the reason for the 90-day pause.",
      "\"No one creates leverage for himself like President Trump,\" Bessent said. Despite the days of market volatility since the tariffs were announced, Bessent said this was Mr. Trump's \"strategy all along.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt reiterated Mr. Trump's insistence that he wasn't considering an extension or delay.",
      "But on Wednesday, the president said he'd been mulling a pause \"over the last few days.\" The president said he decided to forward with the pause early Wednesday morning. He and his top advisers wrote the statement without lawyers present, he said, and came \"from the heart.\"",

      "Prosecutors and attorneys for Bryan Kohberger, the man charged in the killings of four University of Idaho students in 2022, argued some of the final ground rules they want for his trial Wednesday during the first day of a two-day hearing.",
      "Kohberger, 30, is accused in the stabbing deaths of Ethan Chapin, Xana Kernodle, Madison Mogen and Kaylee Goncalves at a rental home near campus in Moscow, Idaho. Prosecutors say the four were killed in the early morning hours of Nov. 13, 2022, and their bodies were discovered later that day.",
      "Kohberger, then a criminal justice graduate student at Washington State University, was arrested in Pennsylvania weeks after the killings. Investigators said they matched his DNA to genetic material recovered from a knife sheath found at the crime scene.",
      "A judge previously entered not guilty pleas on Kohberger's behalf when he remained silent after being asked how he pleaded.",
      "Attorneys for the prosecution and defense have submitted more than 170 legal filings ahead of Kohberger's trial, CBS News correspondent Jonathan Vigliotti reported Wednesday on \"CBS Mornings.\" Among the filings are motions addressing whether Kohberger should face the death penalty if convicted, whether witnesses should be allowed to testify about issues like \"touch DNA,\" and whether certain people should or should not be allowed in the courtroom during the trial.",
      "The hearing gives the attorneys a chance to make their case in person, discussing the legal reasoning behind their requests, and gives 4th District Judge Steven Hippler a chance to ask the attorneys questions as he weighs their arguments.",
      "Hippler can \"rule from the bench\" \u2014 simply telling the attorneys what his decision is on each request \u2014 but he can also decide to issue a written ruling sometime after the hearing is over.",
      "Here are some of the motions discussed.",
      "Amazon purchase data",
      "Kohberger's defense team sought to limit how much of their client's online shopping data can enter the court, as prosecutors allege the suspect used his Amazon account to purchase what they believe to be the murder weapon \u2014\u00a0a Ka-Bar knife with sheath and sharpener \u2014 and legal filings show they want to introduce evidence of his \"click history\" at Amazon.com.",
      "Kohberger's attorneys have argued others had access to the account.",
      "Hippler said the defense is entitled to make the argument that Kohberger did make the purchase, but did not find grounds to exclude the click data as evidence.",
      "Investigators never found the Ka-Bar knife, although they did discover a sheath next to one of the victims at the crime scene. Defense attorneys have suggested the paraphernalia was planted, in another attempt by Kohberger's representation to push back on evidence that's central to the prosecution's case.",
      "Roommate testimony",
      "Kohberger's lawyers have argued against the admissibility of testimony from one of the slain women's surviving roommates, who claims to have seen a masked man with \"bushy eyebrows\" in the house the night of the murders. His lawyers suggested the testimony could unfairly influence the jury.",
      "Prosecutors want to introduce a photo that Kohberger took of himself hours after the time of the killings because they say it shows what he looked like at that time.",
      "Hippler did not make a ruling on the testimony Wednesday.",
      "911 call",
      "The defense and prosecution presented arguments over whether jurors should hear audio of a 911 call made by two women in the house roughly eight hours after the killings, as they realized one of their roommates wasn't waking up.",
      "One of the callers is repeating information she had been told, but the prosecution argued it is an exception to a rule against hearsay because it is \"excited utterance,\" or a statement made amid a stressful event.",
      "Hippler said much of the call meets the qualifications to be presented, but said he will give more specific guidance.",
      "Death penalty",
      "If the jury finds Kohberger guilty, the defense team asked the judge to issue an order that says Kohberger's autism-related characteristics can't be used by prosecutors as \"aggravating factors,\" or reasons that he should get the death penalty.",
      "The prosecution team countered that they have much better aggravating factors to present and don't plan to use Kohberger's autism spectrum condition if the case reaches the penalty phase. But they also don't want the defense to be able to chalk up anything as being related to autism.",
      "Hippler said he will issue a detailed ruling later, but for now is issuing a general ruling that the state can't use autism as an aggravating factor.",
      "Kohberger's family",
      "The prosecution has listed Kohberger's family as potential witnesses. Typically, witnesses are excluded from trials until after they have testified so their testimony isn't influenced by other evidence they may see.",
      "But the defense team says Kohberger's family should be able to attend because it is the humane thing to do and Kohberger relies on their support.",
      "Hippler asked the prosecutors to call family members as quickly as possible and said he will issue a ruling later.",
      "When does Kohberger's trial start?",
      "Jury selection in the case is expected to begin July 30, with the trial starting Aug. 11 in the Ada County Courthouse in downtown Boise.",

    "summary": "President Trump removed Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily halted lower court decisions that voided President Trump's firing of a member of the National Labor Relations Board and a member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, allowing their removals to go back into effect for now.",
      "Roberts issued an administrative stay that gives the Supreme Court more time to consider a Justice Department request to allow Mr. Trump's removal of Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board. He gave lawyers for Harris and Wilcox until 5 p.m. on April 15 to file a response with the court.",
      "The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court earlier Wednesday to block a pair of district court decisions that restored Harris and Wilcox to their roles at the two independent boards. In a request for emergency relief from the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the orders harm the president and the separation of powers.",
      "Sauer asked the high court to issue a stay of district court decisions that found the firings unlawful and said the justices could also take up the case before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit rules. If the Supreme Court chooses that route, Sauer asked it to consider the constitutionality of federal laws that provide removal protections for members of the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"The president should not be forced to delegate his executive power to agency heads who are demonstrably at odds with the administration's policy objectives for a single day \u2014 much less for the months that it would likely take for the courts to resolve this litigation,\" he wrote.",
      "The bid for the Supreme Court's intervention comes as the justices have been faced with a flurry of requests for emergency relief from the Trump administration. More than 150 cases challenging Mr. Trump's second-term agenda have been filed in courts across the country and are progressing through the federal judiciary.",
      "At the center of these disputes is the president's authority to remove executive branch officers from their positions at independent agencies. Wilcox was appointed to the NLRB by former President Joe Biden in 2021 and confirmed to a second, five-year term in 2023. Harris, meanwhile, was named to the MSPB for a seven-year term by Biden in 2022 and designated its chair in 2024.",
      "But Wilcox and Harris received emails soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House informing them that they were being removed from their positions on their respective boards. They each challenged their firing in federal district court, asserting that their termination violated federal laws that limited the grounds for their removal to neglect of duty or malfeasance, and sought relief restoring them to their roles.",
      "In early March, two separate federal judges in Washington, D.C., ruled for Harris and Wilcox, finding that it was unlawful for Mr. Trump to fire them. The judges declared the removals null and void, and said the two each remained members of their respective boards.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit last month agreed to pause those decisions, clearing the way for the president to remove Harris and Wilcox once again. The officials asked the full complement of judges to reconsider their cases, and earlier this week, the full D.C. Circuit ruled 7-4 to put the district court orders back in place, meaning Wilcox and Harris could go back to their jobs at the NLRB and MSPB while they challenged the removals.",
      "In the emergency appeal with the Supreme Court, Sauer argued that Article II of the Constitution empowers the president to remove at-will members of multi-member boards that exercise \"substantial executive power,\" like the NLRB and MSPB.",
      "\"Federal courts lack any constitutional, statutory, or equitable authority to order the reinstatement of agency heads whom the president has removed and to force the president to rely on principal officers whom the president believes should not be exercising any executive power,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer said that the NLRB and MSPB both fall outside an exception to the president's power to remove executive officers established by the Supreme Court in 1935. In that case, Humphrey's Executor v. United States, the high court found that Congress could impose for-cause removal protections to multi-member commissions of experts that are balanced along partisan lines and do not exercise any executive power.",
      "Both agencies, he said, exercise \"substantial\" executive power in executing laws governing the workforce or labor relations.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has shaken up\u00a0stock markets\u00a0around the world as he announced\u00a0sweeping tariffs\u00a0on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\"\u00a0last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.",
      "In the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report\u00a0raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and\u00a0\"will likely increase inflation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.",
      "Exactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.",
      "The reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs\u00a0on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and\u00a0then announced a pause just two days later.",

      "As markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent\u00a0reciprocal import duties\u00a0paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.",
      "Trump reverses course, pauses tariffs",
      "Two days after Mr. Trump said during a\u00a0meeting with Israeli Prime Minister\u00a0Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% \u2014 with the exception of China.",
      "The U.S.\u00a0stock market surged\u00a0immediately after the president's announcement.",
      "When reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"",
      "\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"",
      "On April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would\u00a0raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%.",
      "The president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.",
      "\"Hang tough\"",
      "In a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"",
      "\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.",
      "\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"",
      "\"Sometimes you have to take medicine\"",
      "Mr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.",
      "Addressing the U.S. market plunge\u00a0that followed his April 2 announcement \u2014 Wall Street's worst in five years \u2014 and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.",
      "He also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.",
      "\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"",
      "Echoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on\u00a0\"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"\u00a0Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"",
      "\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"",
      "\"Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!)\"",
      "In the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.",
      "\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"",
      "He posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day, with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.",
      "Additional tariffs on China",
      "Mr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.",
      "On Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.",
      "\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "China did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped\u00a0its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84%.",

      "A global trade war is brewing as the U.S. imposes tariffs on a growing list of countries, heightening concerns about economic growth and roiling stock markets around the world.",
      "President Trump on April 2 announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations that are above a 10% across-the-board tax applied to all imports to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \"Liberation Day,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase a trade deficit between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to the European Union.",
      "Some nations are facing only the universal tariff of 10%, while imports from dozens of other countries are charged a higher specific reciprocal import levy. For instance, Australian imports face the baseline rate of 10%, while China-made products are now paying an import duty that has jumped to 104%\u00a0\u2014 the reciprocal tariffs combined with previously announced duties of 20% \u2014 after slapping its own tariffs on U.S. imports.",
      "\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us, and we do it to them,\" Mr. Trump said in his April 2 remarks.",
      "However, on April 9 Mr. Trump backed away from parts of his plan, announcing a 90-day pause on the reciprocal tariffs and lowering the tariff rate to 10% for almost all nations. The notable exception was China, with Mr. Trump saying that he's instead raising the tariff rate on the country's imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social.",
      "Stocks soared after Mr. Trump's April 9 announcement, with the S&P 500 gaining 8.4% in afternoon trading and the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging 7%. Still, some on Wall Street cautioned that the pause is still on track to end in 90 days, which could signal more volatility ahead.",

      "Mr. Trump also said such levies will boost domestic manufacturing and level the playing field with other countries that impose higher tariffs on U.S. imports than the U.S. charges for their products. Still, economists are forecasting that the tariffs will cause inflation to reignite, while also prompting some trade partners to retaliate with higher tariffs on American imports to their nations.",

      "How did the Trump administration decide what tariffs to charge which countries?",

      "Apple iPhones could become even pricier under President Trump's reciprocal tariffs on roughly 90 foreign nations, which were slated to take effect Wednesday, but are now on hold for 90 days, with the exception of levies on China.",
      "In a move that threatens to raise costs on all electronics, including iPhones, the White House on Tuesday said it would follow through on a threat to enact a 104% tariff on all Chinese goods imported into the U.S. The levy took effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EDT. Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump raised the tariff rate to 125%, effective immediately.",
      "The price for the popular tech tool, which starts at $599 for the most basic model, the iPhone 16e, is poised to increase by hundreds of dollars, depending on how Apple responds to the sweeping levies. The iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which features Apple Intelligence, costs $999.",
      "The iPhone accounts for about half of Apple's revenue. Most of its smartphones are manufactured in China.",
      "Wedbush Securities tech analyst Dan Ives said in a research note Tuesday that the added levies could create a \"category 5 price storm\" for personal electronics and other gadgets. Taxing China and other nations at such rates is the equivalent of \"flipping a boat upside down in the ocean with no life rafts,\" he added.",
      "How much more could an iPhone cost?",
      "The iPhone 16 Pro Max 256 GB, which is among the devices that are assembled in China, retails for $1,199. Under the new tariffs on Chinese imports, the price of the device could rise by $675, or 56%, lifting the price tag to $1,874, an April 9 analysts from UBS Investment Research shows.",
      "The cost of an iPhone 16 Pro 128 GB, which is made in India and costs $999, could increase to $1,119, an increase of 12%, the investment bank found.",

      "Apple didn't respond to a request for comment on how the Trump tariffs could affect iPhone prices.",
      "What if Apple moved production to the U.S.?",
      "President Trump has said the new U.S. tariffs are aimed at spurring both domestic and foreign companies to build in the U.S. But for Apple and other companies, manufacturing their products in the U.S. entail significantly higher labor costs \u2014 costs that would largely be passed on to consumers.",
      "If Apple were to begin assembling iPhones in the U.S, a Chinese-made device that previously sold for $1,000 would cost $3,500 if manufactured in New Jersey, Texas or some other state, Ives estimated.",
      "\"Saying we can just make this in the USA is a statement that incredibly understates the complexity of the Asia supply chain and the way electronics, chips, semi fabs, hardware, smartphones, etc. are made for U.S. consumers over the last 30 years,\" he said in a report.",
      "As a result, Ives is highly skeptical that tariffs alone will lead companies to shift their manufacturing plants from low-cost havens like China to the U.S., calling the idea \"absurd.\"",
      "But some companies, including Apple, could attempt to rejigger supply chains to avoid the steepest tariffs. For example, Apple plans to manufacture more iPhones in India to reduce its reliance on China, the Wall Street Journal\u00a0reported, citing people familiar with the matter.",

      "The 84% tax will make it much more costly for Chinese companies to purchase and bring U.S.-made goods into the country, and could cut U.S. producers off from an important trade market.",

      "China's top imports from the U.S. in 2023 were oilseeds and grains, followed by oil and gas. Oilseeds and grain exports fell by $7 billion from 2022 to 2023, and could fall even more substantially under the current tit-for-tat tariff spat between the U.S. and China. Grains include crops such as soybeans, wheat and corn.",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 14:09:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The first firing squad execution in over 15 years was carried out last month. It provides a glimpse into how such executions may go.",
    "story": [
      "South Carolina is set to execute another death row inmate by firing squad, a little more than a month after a convicted murderer was executed the same way.",
      "The March 7 execution of Brad Sigmon marked the first execution by firing squad since 2010. Before Sigmon, only three people i the U.S. had been executed by firing squad since the 1970s.",
      "Mikal Mahdi is set to be executed on Friday, April 11. He chose firing squad over lethal injection or electrocution, just as Sigmon did.",
      "Mahdi, 41, was convicted of the 2004 death of Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers. Authorities said that Mahdi had killed a store clerk in North Carolina and stole a vehicle at gunpoint in Columbia when he hid in Myers' shed at his Calhoun County farm after he couldn't buy gas for the stolen car.",
      "Myers was shot eight or nine times. His wife found his burned body in the shed, which had been the backdrop for their wedding 15 months earlier. Mahdi was arrested several days later in Myers' unmarked police truck in Florida.",
      "Mahdi also pleaded guilty to shooting Winston-Salem, North Carolina, convenience store clerk Christopher Boggs twice in the head three days before Myers was killed. He was sentenced to life in prison for Boggs' death.",
      "South Carolina's highest court rejected Mahdi's last major appeal earlier this week. Mahdi's lawyers argued that his original attorneys put on a shallow case trying to spare his life and failed to call on relatives and others who knew him in his sentencing defense, but the state Supreme Court ruled that many of those arguments had been made in earlier, also unsuccessful appeals.",
      "South Carolina is legally required to keep some protocols for the execution method secret, but Sigmon's death last month reveals a few key details. Here's what to know about how the execution will go.",
      "Mahdi will wear black, have a target on his chest",
      "The execution process will begin just before 6 p.m. Friday, when the prison warden calls Governor Henry McMaster and asks if he is granting clemency. The warden will also ask the Attorney General's Office if there are any legal blocks to the execution.",
      "If both answers are no, Mahdi will enter the death chamber at the Broad River Correctional Institute in Columbia, South Carolina, the same prison where Sigmon was put to death. He will likely wear black jogging pants and a T-shirt, as Sigmon did, instead of the green prison jumpsuits usually worn by death row inmates. There will be a target with a red bull's-eye on his chest.",
      "Mahdi will then be secured to a chair, with straps around his waist, ankles and arms. Then a curtain to the witness room will open. The right side of Mahdi's face and body will be toward the window.",
      "Mahdi's lawyer or a prison official can read a final statement, if he wishes. A hood will then be placed on his head by a prison employee, who will then walk across the room and open a black pull shade covering the rectangular window where three volunteer shooters are waiting.",
      "All three volunteers are prison employees. Not much is known about them. Prison officials said they have \"completed all required training.\" A shield law passed in 2023, in part to keep the name of any supplier of lethal injection drugs secret, also keeps secret many details about the firing squad, including the names of anyone on the execution team and what specific training they received.",
      "The three volunteers will hold rifles about 15 feet from Mahdi. There won't be any kind of countdown before the three open fire. Shortly afterwards, a doctor with a stethescope will come out to confirm Mahdi is dead. Witnesses will sign an official document stating they saw the execution, then leave.",
      "Specialty bullets designed to destroy the heart",
      "While few details about the volunteer shooters have been made public, a few details about firing squad protocols came out in 2022 during an unrelated trial that ultimately led the state Supreme Court to rule the firing squad, electric chair and lethal injection were all legal and didn't violate the U.S. Constitution's ban on cruel and unusual punishment.",
      "The state will use .308-caliber Winchester 110-grain TAP Urban ammunition often found in police rifles, said Colie Rushton, the director of Security and Emergency Operations at the Corrections Department.",
      "The round is designed to break apart as soon as it hits something firm, in this case the prisoner's rib cage. Fragments will spread out, and the intent is to destroy as much of the heart as possible.",
      "A medical expert for the state said at the 2022 trial that if the heart is heavily damaged an inmate would lose consciousness almost immediately and likely not feel pain. The doctor said survivors of gunshots often report first feeling like they were punched and pain only following a few seconds later.",
      "But a doctor testifying for inmates said it could take longer for an inmate to lose consciousness. He said that, anyone who has broken a rib knows, breathing becomes extremely painful once the bones in the chest are cracked.",
      "If the aim of the executioners is not true, death could take even longer. Damaged hearts can continue to pump blood.",
      "The information released by the state to the public gives no indication what might happen if an inmate survives the initial shots. At the 2022 trial, a doctor testifying on behalf of inmates said his review of protocols indicated the squad could fire again.",
      "\"There was no sound\"",
      "Jeffrey Collins, one of three media witnesses for the firing squad execution of Brad Sigmon, detailed his experience in an essay\u00a0published by the Associated Press. He described many of the details listed above, including Sigmon's black clothing and the lack of warning for witnesses before the shots were fired.",
      "\"There was no warning or countdown. The abrupt crack of the rifles startled me,\" Collins wrote. \"And the white target with the red bullseye that had been on his chest, standing out against his black prison jumpsuit, disappeared instantly as Sigmon's whole body flinched.\"",
      "Collins described the site of the impact as a \"jagged red spot about the size of the small fist.\"",
      "\"His chest moved two or three times. Outside of the rifle crack, there was no sound,\" Collins continued. Sigmon was declared dead about two minutes later, he said.",
      "Collins noted that he will likely attend other firing squad executions at Broad River Correctional Institution, but did not specify if Mahdi was one of those cases.",

      "China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect today at a rate of 104%.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. But on Wednesday afternoon the president announced he is pausing most of the new import taxes for 90 days and lowering the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately,",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump said he's increasing the tariff on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president continued, \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"",
      "China decries U.S. \"mistake\"",
      "China's announcement signals Beijing isn't backing down in a global trade war sparked by Mr. Trump's April 2 decision to levy so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every nation. In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Beijing has also expanded its exports to other countries, particularly developing nations, as it seeks to lessen its reliance on the U.S., research group Onyx Strategic Insights noted in a recent report.",
      "\"China has spent the last five years Trump-proofing its economy \u2014 it has been working to nationalize supply chains, it has been working to penetrate different export markets, particularly in the developing world,\" Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. China is \"willing to endure the pain, thinking they can handle it longer than we can, and they might have a point.\"",
      "China was the third-largest export market for the U.S. in 2023, following Canada and Mexico, with $145 billion in goods shipped to the Asian nation that year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. Oilseeds and grains are the top export that the U.S. sends to China, followed by oil and gas.",
      "EU also hitting back",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Backlash to President Trump's tariffs cropped up throughout Capitol Hill in recent days, as Democrats, and some Republicans, expressed concern about the sweeping levies on foreign imports \u2014 while putting forward a handful of possible methods to counter them.",
      "On April 2, the president announced a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. trading partners while increasing levies on dozens of countries that charge higher taxes on American exports. And after what Mr. Trump described as \"Liberation Day,\" investors appeared spooked, with members of Congress unclear on the path forward.",
      "The response from some lawmakers was swift. Sens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced bipartisan legislation the next day aimed at reasserting Congress' role over trade policy. The measure, known as the Trade Review Act of 2025, would require the president to give Congress 48 hours' notice before imposing or raising tariffs. The president would have to include an explanation and analysis of the potential impact, while lawmakers would have the ability to end the levy with a joint resolution.",
      "Grassley said in a statement that Congress has for too long \"delegated its clear authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce to the executive branch,\" while Cantwell argued that the same check and balance that prevents the president from unilaterally declaring war should exist \"as it relates to protecting our commerce activities.\"Rep. Don Bacon is sponsoring\u00a0companion legislation\u00a0in the House, which he introduced Monday.",
      "Another House effort to address the president's tariffs also got underway this week. Rep. Gregory Meeks, a New York Democrat who serves as the ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, introduced a resolution Tuesday to force a vote to block the president's newest round of tariffs, after pledging to do so when Mr. Trump made the announcement.",
      "\"Republicans can't keep ducking this \u2014 it's time they show whether they support the economic pain Trump is inflicting on their constituents,\" Meeks said in a post on X last week.",
      "The move would force a vote on the House floor within 15 days. But the resolution would ultimately require the president's signature or a veto-proof majority, making it a gambit unlikely to succeed.",
      "The efforts come after the Senate approved a resolution last week aimed at blocking the president's Canada tariffs, as a handful of Republicans bucked their party leader to support the measure. The bill would have to be approved by the House, and Meeks announced plans last week to introduce a discharge petition to force the House to take a vote on the issue.",
      "Meanwhile, House Republican leadership has taken steps to quash efforts to block Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last month, they included as part of a\u00a0bill to keep the government funded\u00a0a provision that widely blocks members from forcing a vote on the Canada and Mexico tariffs amid a similar push by Meeks. And this week, as the House prepared to vote on another major piece of legislation, a provision that would prevent members from forcing a vote to block Mr. Trump's tariffs announced April 2 was tucked into a rule governing the measure. When Democratic Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez of New Mexico introduced an amendment to strike the provision, Republicans on the House Rules Committee opposed it.",
      "\"Republicans, through this rule, are refusing to follow the Constitution, which says that Congress shall have the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations,\" Leger Fernandez said, noting that just a handful of Republican would need to side with Democrats to review and effectively block the tariffs. \"But Republicans think that they can stop time and stop debate, and in that way, avoid actually voting on the tariffs, actually debating on the tariffs, which is our job.\"",
      "Whether any of the moves can make it through both chambers and have an impact on the tariffs or trade situation more broadly remains to be seen.",
      "Laura  Garrison and \n                                                  \n                      Alan  He\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "story": [
      "When Kathleen Whitman's daughter's Bernadoodle, Cody, swallowed a Kong toy, the family faced a veterinary emergency requiring immediate surgery.",
      "X-rays at their local suburban clinic suggested what looked like a hair tie tangled in Cody's intestines. When referred to a corporate emergency hospital, the family was quoted $10,000 for the procedure.",
      "\"They literally told me in the waiting room with a clipboard, thinking I was just coming in and we were doing $10,000,\" Whitman said. \"I said, 'No, I'm just coming in to hear the price.\"",
      "Desperate for an alternative, Whitman reached out to Vetique, a boutique veterinary clinic in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. There, Dr. Jessica Trice and Dr. Jennifer Remnes performed the surgery for what Whitman called \"an appropriate fee\" that was significantly less than $10,000.",
      "During the surgery, she and her daughter waited in the clinic's lobby with glasses of Prosecco while receiving regular updates.",
      "\"The humans were taken care of just as much as the puppy in distress was,\" Whitman said.",
      "This experience mirrors what many pet owners report when comparing corporate-owned emergency animal hospitals to independent practices. Kara Adams, whose 16-year-old rescue dog Shadow needed emergency eye surgery, also chose Vetique over corporate alternatives.",
      "When Adams called Vetique explaining she had only $1,000 available, staff accommodated her financial constraints.",
      "\"The planning manager came out with a payment plan for me,\" Adams said. \"I was crying because otherwise, what would I do? I didn't have any other options.\"",
      "\"You literally burn people out\"",
      "Drs. Trice and Remnes founded Vetique after witnessing firsthand how corporate consolidation was transforming veterinary medicine \u2014 often for the worse.",
      "\"Just coming from a corporation for many years, the whole thing is about quantity, getting all those pets,\" Trice explained after spending 10 years at Banfield Pet Hospital, followed by five years as a medical director at VCA Animal Hospitals. \"We feel the best way is not pushing about the number of quantity, because it gets very sloppy and you lose that interaction and relationship with the clients.\"",
      "Remnes' experience echoed her partner's concerns. At Banfield as a new graduate, she found herself overwhelmed by volume demands.",
      "\"As a new grad, you're still learning and trying to break into this brand-new world. I was seeing like 30 pets a day,\" Remnes said.",
      "She later moved to VCA before its Mars acquisition, initially enjoying the autonomy because \"each hospital was able to operate as they liked to.\" After the corporate takeover, however, the pressure intensified.",
      "\"It was like, 'Oh, you need to see this number of pets, or we're decreasing your salary.' That's what's burning out the industry,\" Remnes said. \"You literally burn people out doing that. You can't possibly offer your best when you're crammed with all of these patients.\"",
      "These pressures contribute to a profession in crisis. A 2024 study in the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association found that U.S. veterinarians are more likely to experience serious mental health struggles than most people.",
      "\"We have forums on Facebook where our industry has one of the highest suicide rates,\" Remnes noted. \"It's because of things like this, when you're given spreadsheets and quotas rather than focusing on patient care.\"",
      "Their solution was to create a different business model. Instead of maximizing patient volume, Vetique prioritizes extended appointment times and a calming environment with luxury touches like sparkling epoxy floors, examination tables with faux fur coverings and exam rooms named after the founders' pets.",
      "\"I'd rather see four pets a day. That meant that family was getting my full attention, that pet was getting everything that I do,\" Remnes explained.",
      "Alongside traditional veterinary medicine, Trice offers acupuncture, herbal remedies and chiropractic treatments \u2014 holistic approaches she had wanted to pursue at corporate practices but was discouraged from using.",
      "Surging pet care prices",
      "Setting prices at Vetique involves balancing fair market rates with the clinic's added value. What Remnes found surprising was how significantly corporate prices have increased in recent years. \"Prices are so drastically different from when I was at VCA seven years ago. They're charging actually close to what we're charging as a general practice for an exam,\" she noted.",
      "This observation led her to reconsider Vetique's own pricing strategy.",
      "\"It's like, 'Well, we can actually probably charge more, because we offer all these experiences along with it.' It's trying to find a happy medium, trying to be fair, but also knowing our value.\"",
      "Despite the appeal of the boutique model, both Remnes and Trice acknowledge significant business challenges. The clinic is in its third year of operation, still within the typical three-to-five-year window before seeing substantial returns. Unlike corporate-backed veterinary chains, Vetique is entirely funded through a bank loan.",
      "Vetique's founders see their clinic not as a competitor to corporate chains but as an alternative model for the industry. \"We're not competing,\" Trice said. \"We're creating a new veterinary culture.\"",
      "Corporate giants reshape vet landscape",
      "John Volk, senior consultant with Brakke Consulting, said veterinary practices historically grow 4-5% annually and carry minimal accounts receivable, making them attractive to investors.",
      "\"Pet care in general is very attractive to the financial community,\" Volk said. \"It's a very steady growth industry, and it's a cash business, so they carry very little accounts receivable because pet owners pay for their services at time of service.\"",
      "Mars Inc., best known for candy brands like M&M's and Snickers, has quietly become the largest owner of veterinary hospitals in the U.S. through a series of major acquisitions.",
      "The privately held company owns three of the nation's largest veterinary chains: Banfield Pet Hospital, VCA Animal Hospitals, and BluePearl Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital \u2014 giving it control of more than 2,000 clinics across North America.",
      "Mars entered the pet care industry in 2007 by acquiring Banfield, which primarily operates inside PetSmart locations. In 2017, it significantly expanded its footprint by purchasing VCA for $9.1 billion \u2014 one of the largest acquisitions in veterinary history,\u00a0according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.",
      "VCA operates more than 900 hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, while Banfield has over 1,000 clinics nationwide. Unlike VCA, which grew by acquiring independent practices, Banfield has mostly launched new locations within retail stores.",
      "Mars's scale allows for standardized protocols, shared technology platforms and subscription-based wellness plans across its network. According to the company website, Mars Veterinary Health serves more than 25 million pets annually.",
      "While private equity firms have been acquiring veterinary practices since the late 1980s, the trend has accelerated significantly over the past 15 years. Volk estimates approximately 30% of veterinary practices are now corporate-owned.",
      "Despite the growth in corporate ownership, Volk sees no evidence that care quality differs significantly between corporate and independent practices.",
      "\"I've not seen any data to suggest that the services provided by corporately owned practices are materially different than services provided by independently owned practices,\" he said.",
      "However, some policymakers have raised concerns about the impact of consolidation on pricing. In January 2023, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, specifically called out Mars Veterinary Health and other large veterinary corporations in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission. Warren cited \"troubling reports of anti-competitive consolidation\" and suggested these corporate entities were using market power to \"raise prices for consumers and lower wages for veterinarians.\"",
      "Even as consolidation continues, Volk finds that independent practices remain viable. \"If you have a DVM degree and don't have a bad personal history, you can get money to buy or start a practice,\" he said. \"Veterinarians are one of the lowest-risk borrowers of any category.\"",
      "For new veterinarians, the industry offers growing opportunities. The American Veterinary Medical Association reports the average starting salary in companion animal medicine reached approximately $137,000 in 2024.",
      "Design, investment, and a human touch",
      "When clients walk into a Bond Vet clinic, they won't find the sterile environment or cluttered waiting rooms traditionally associated with veterinary offices. Instead, they'll encounter soft pastel colors, comfortable seating and an atmosphere deliberately designed to feel more like a high-end hospitality experience than a medical facility.",
      "\"The industry has two categories of clinics historically \u2014 many designed very clinical, cold and sterile, and then others called mom and pop, which could be cluttered or dirty,\" said Garrett Lewis, CEO of Bond Vet. \"The question is how to solve both problems.\"",
      "That solution \u2013 creating premium veterinary experiences with transparent pricing and greater accessibility \u2013 has attracted significant private equity investment.",
      "While these premium services might suggest significantly higher costs, Lewis emphasizes transparency in Bond Vet's pricing model. \"When someone comes in, you can look at the laptop and see exactly what the pricing is,\" he said. \"Our prices are just a little bit above average, but the experience is what differentiates us.\"",
      "This transparency extends to digital platforms, where clients can check prices online or via text before visiting. During appointments, veterinarians show pricing information directly to clients on laptops, allowing for discussion about options.",
      "Bond Vet, backed by a $170 million investment from Warburg Pincus, has expanded to 57 locations across the Northeast and Midwest since its founding in 2019. The company was inspired by human-focused healthcare models like One Medical, focusing on convenience, design, and a better experience for both pets and owners.",
      "\"They saw the same issue, which was that the industry wasn't serving clients and pets at a much higher level,\" Lewis said of Bond Vet's founders, who included a veterinarian and her husband. \"They quickly found it was very different to change culture and design in existing practices, so they rebooted from the ground up.\"",
      "Bond Vet's approach represents a broader trend in veterinary medicine, where traditional practices are being reinvented with a focus on client experience alongside medical care.",
      "Bond Vet's model bridges the gap between traditional veterinary practices and emergency hospitals, offering urgent care alongside preventative services \u2013 all with a hospitality-focused approach.",
      "\"In the 90s, if you needed sick care, your veterinarian would say, 'Come on in.' If you needed preventive care, they'd say, 'Come on in,'\" Lewis explained. \"What happened in the 2000s is a lot of specialization occurred where practices became just preventative and started referring out anything that looked urgent or sick.\"",
      "Bond Vet handles non-emergency urgent cases that might otherwise end up in expensive emergency rooms. \"ER practices see about 40% of their volume as urgent rather than emergent cases. Clients go to ER and spend twice as much, often having to wait longer,\" Lewis noted.",
      "These clinics feature design elements specifically created to reduce stress for pets \u2014 an approach that appears to be working. \"I always see dogs dragging their owners into the clinic, which is not a common thing,\" Lewis said.",
      "The \"no walls\" philosophy breaking ground",
      "Imagine walking into a veterinary emergency room and instead of being separated from your pet during a crisis, you're welcomed directly onto the treatment floor. At Veterinary Emergency Group (VEG), this isn't just possible \u2014 it's mandatory.",
      "\"We built an entire business around it,\" said Dr. David Bessler, founder and CEO of VEG. \"It's much easier doing something 100% of the time than trying to do it 90% of the time.\"",
      "With 102 locations across 28 states, VEG represents an approach to emergency veterinary medicine that stands apart from both traditional practices and newer primary care models.",
      "Unlike other veterinary innovators that blend primary and urgent care, VEG focuses exclusively on emergency medicine \u2013 a deliberate strategy that Bessler calls \"a bit of a crazy bet.\"",
      "\"We took the hardest part of an industry, emergency, and created an entire business around that,\" said David Gladstein, co-founder and president of VEG. \"It's hard to make money, it's hard to get the team, it's hard to recruit, it's hard to train.\"",
      "VEG's most distinctive feature is its commitment to keeping pets with their owners throughout the entire treatment process, even during emergencies \u2014 an approach not found in traditional emergency hospitals where pets are typically treated in back rooms away from owners.",
      "This transparency extends to the physical design of newer VEG hospitals, which have eliminated traditional waiting rooms entirely. \"Our newer hospitals don't even have a lobby,\" Gladstein explained. \"You literally walk in and you're in the middle of the treatment floor.\"",
      "In a notable departure from many veterinary innovators, VEG has achieved financial independence from its initial investors and now funds its expansion through its own operations.",
      "\"VEG is now independently able to do that,\" Gladstein stated. \"We don't need anyone else to advocate for us or to pay for us. We're not beholden to anybody. We're beholden to our customers, and we're beholden to our veggies.\"",
      "This independence allows the company to maintain its distinctive approach while continuing to open 25-30 new locations annually.",
      "The company's exclusive focus on emergency care, while limiting in some ways, has allowed it to \"crack the code\" on veterinary emergencies according to Gladstein. \"We've kind of cracked the code on one way of doing things in emergency that results in a better experience for all of the souls that are there experiencing that at the same time.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 09 Apr 2025 13:19:01 -0400",
    "summary": "A federal judge granted the Associated Press' request for a preliminary injunction and ordered White House officials to restore its access to certain spaces.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Tuesday ruled for the Associated Press in its ongoing legal dispute with the White House and ordered top officials to restore the news outlet's access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other spaces and events when they are open to White House reporters.",
      "In a 41-page decision, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden granted the AP a preliminary injunction blocking the federal government from restricting its access to certain media events because of its decision to continue using the name Gulf of Mexico. President Trump on his first day in office issued an executive order renaming the body of water the Gulf of America.",
      "\"The AP seeks restored eligibility for admission to the press pool and limited-access press events, untainted by an impermissible viewpoint-based exclusion,\" McFadden wrote. \"That is all the court orders today: For the government to put the AP on an equal playing field as similarly situated outlets, despite the AP's use of disfavored terminology.\"",
      "McFadden, appointed to the federal bench by Mr. Trump, said his injunction doesn't limit the \"various permissible reasons\" the government may have from excluding journalists from events where access is limited or mandate that all eligible reporters be given access to the president or private government spaces.",
      "He clarified that his decision also does not bar government officials from choosing which journalists to participate in interviews with or from publicly expressing their own views.",
      "\"The court simply holds that under the First Amendment, if the government opens its doors to some journalists \u2014 be it to the Oval Office, the East Room, or elsewhere \u2014 it cannot then shut those doors to other journalists because of their viewpoints.\u00a0 The Constitution requires no less,\" McFadden wrote in his opinion.",
      "McFadden put his decision on hold through April 13 to allow the government time to seek emergency relief from a higher court and prepare to implement the injunction. The Trump administration notified the court\u00a0on Wednesday that it is appealing the decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "McFadden found that AP reporters have been \"systematically banned\" from White House events that the broader press corps has been able to attend since Feb. 13, resulting in an \"erosion of quality and capability\" of the news outlet's reporting, and leaving the agency with a product that is \"a shadow of its former self.\"",
      "\"To state the obvious, if the AP's wire reporters are not in the room when news happens, they can hardly be the first to break the news.\u00a0 Instead, they are forced to wait and pick up whatever scraps of verifiable information they can find as they watch their competitors break the story first,\" McFadden wrote, adding that AP reporters \"cannot ask questions from outside a closed door.\"",
      "The dispute between the AP and the White House began after Mr. Trump declared that the name for the Gulf of Mexico would be changed to the Gulf of America. In the wake of that decision, the AP declined to update its influential Stylebook \u2014 used in many newsrooms worldwide \u2014 to reflect the name-change.",
      "The AP said in an announcement on Jan. 23 that Mr. Trump's order renaming the Gulf of Mexico only carries authority within the United States, and other countries did not have to recognize the change. It said that as an international news agency, \"the AP must ensure that places, names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences.\"",
      "The AP, a news wire service, is a regular outlet in the White House press pool, which is a group of rotating reporters, videographers and photographers who cover the president daily and travel with him when he leaves the White House grounds. Because of the broad reach of the AP's coverage, local newspapers increasingly rely on it and other syndicated news outlets.",
      "An estimated 4 billion people read the AP daily, the wire service estimates, and it has journalists reporting in nearly 100 countries.",
      "After the AP said it would continue using the name Gulf of Mexico, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt informed its chief White House correspondent on February 11 that the outlet would no longer be allowed in the Oval Office as part of the press pool until the AP changed its Stylebook to use Gulf of America, according to court filings.",
      "AP reporters were then barred from attending press pool events at the White House, including executive order signings in the Oval Office and a press conference, as well as other gatherings covered by the pool in places where Mr. Trump was speaking, the outlet said.",
      "Reporters with the AP who have credentials, known as a \"hard pass,\" that allow general access to White House facilities have also been denied access to events including Mr. Trump's Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as the president's meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda at a convention center in Maryland, according to filings.",
      "But the AP has argued that its access has been restricted beyond those events covered by the press pool to include those covered by the wider White House press corps.",
      "The news outlet filed its lawsuit against White House officials in late February, and the court initially denied the AP's request for a temporary restraining order. But following a hearing last month for a longer preliminary injunction, McFadden granted that relief.",
      "\"The court concludes that the AP is likely to succeed on the merits of its First Amendment viewpoint-discrimination and retaliation claims for both its press pool and East Room allegations,\" the judge wrote.",
      "McFadden found that while the AP does not have a constitutional right to enter the Oval Office, it does have a right not to be excluded based on viewpoint.",
      "\"The AP says that is exactly what is happening. The court agrees,\" he said. \"Indeed, the government has been brazen about this. Several high ranking officials have repeatedly said that they are restricting the AP's access precisely because of the organization's viewpoint.\"",
      "While the White House has said that the AP enjoys the same general media access as other hard-pass holders, McFadden wrote in his decision that \"the AP indeed has been excluded from large events far more often than its peers,\" and found that the wire service is likely to succeed on its claim that White House officials are impermissibly excluding it from limited-access events, like those held in the East Room of the White House and off its grounds.",
      "\"The AP made an editorial decision to continue using 'Gulf of Mexico' in its Stylebook. The government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP's access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities,\" the judge wrote. \"If there is a benign explanation for the government's decision, it has not been presented here.\"",
      "McFadden said the disadvantages of having its access restricted have \"poisoned the AP's business model,\" as its ability to disseminate photographs and breaking news has dwindled.",
      "The AP, he said \"cannot be treated worse than its peer wire services either. The court merely declares that the AP's exclusion has been contrary to the First Amendment, and it enjoins the government from continuing down that unlawful path.\"",
      "During the preliminary injunction hearing last month, AP photographer Evan Vucci, who took the infamous photo of Mr. Trump with his fist in the air after the president was hit in the ear with a bullet last July in Pennsylvania, testified on the stand in support of returning his access.",
      "\"It kills us,\" Vucci said, arguing that the outlet's photographers are the \"gold standard\" of photojournalism.",
      "In initial arguments in the case, an attorney for the Trump administration argued that the \"content of a journalist's speech\" can be considered in whether to grant access or not and that Mr. Trump has the ability to block any media he wants from access.",
      "\"There is no right to have special access to the Oval Office,\" the attorney said.",
      "White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, one of three administration officials sued by the AP, argued in a court filing in support of the administration's ban that the determination to ban the outlet from covering Mr. Trump as part of the White House press pool was not about cutting it off entirely from accessing the White House, but rather, \"losing special media access to the president \u2014 a quintessentially discretionary presidential choice that infringes no constitutional right.\"",

    "summary": "Federal judges in New York and Texas temporarily blocked the deportations of certain Venezuelan migrants facing removal under Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.",
    "story": [
      "Federal judges in both New York and Texas have blocked the deportations of Venezuelan men likely to be deported under the Trump administration's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, again stopping the White House's attempts to remove alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang after the Supreme Court cleared the way for their deportations this week.",
      "In one case filed in Manhattan, attorneys for two Venezuelan men who are currently being detained in Orange County, New York, successfully argued to block their clients' deportations and movement outside of the state and the United States. U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, appointed to the federal bench by President Clinton, granted the temporary relief.",
      "After their arrests, both men were first transferred to an ICE detention center in Texas before being moved to New York. One man, who is 21, came to the U.S. to escape Tren de Aragua violence, and the other, who is 32, actively protested the regime of Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro, their attorneys wrote.",
      "The new case in Texas was brought on behalf of the same Venezuelans who challenged their potential deportation in Washington, D.C., where the initial block of the deportations was entered by U.S. District Judge James Boasberg before it was lifted by the Supreme Court on Monday in a 5-4 decision. The Texas judge overseeing the petition, Fernando Rodriguez Jr., was appointed to the federal bench by President Trump during his first term.",
      "In a brief order shortly after the habeas petition was filed, Rodriguez blocked the Trump administration from transferring or removing from the El Valle Detention Center the three Venezuelan men or any other Venezuelan citizen held in the Southern District of Texas who are subject to deportation under Mr. Trump's proclamation.",
      "The temporary order also prevents the Trump administration from unilaterally transporting those migrants outside of Willacy County \u2014 where the detention facility is located \u2014 or neighboring Cameron County, Texas.",
      "The temporary restraining order from Rodriguez will remain in place until April 23, or until he weighs in further. He is set to consider whether to extend his order or issue other forms of emergency relief at a hearing set for Friday.",
      "Rodriguez wrote in his decision that absent emergency relief, there is a \"substantial likelihood\" that federal immigration officials will remove the Venezuelan migrants who face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act from the U.S.",
      "\"In the present matter, the court finds that the removal of J.A.V, J.G.G., W.G.H., or any other individual subject to the proclamation, by the United States would cause immediate and irreparable injury to the removed individuals, as they would be unable to seek habeas relief,\" he wrote. \"Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States\"",
      "Rodriguez referenced the ongoing case brought by a Maryland man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was arrested by immigration authorities last month and sent to El Salvador, where he is currently in the notorious prison known as CECOT. A Trump administration official acknowledged Abrego Garcia's removal to El Salvador was an \"administrative error,\" but the government has said he is now in custody of the Salvadoran government.",
      "An emergency appeal involving Abrego Garcia is currently pending before the Supreme Court.",
      "Both sets of plaintiffs are attempting to convince judges not just to block the deportations of the men who filed suit, but to block all future deportations of any Venezuelans under this statute. They argue that the Trump administration's invocation of the law is unconstitutional because the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela and dispute the government's categorization of the plaintiffs as gang members, arguing they have been falsely accused of being in the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "\"Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or a foreign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government,\" the complaint filed in Texas says, adding that the government's evidence for Tren de Aragua membership \"relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, logos, graffiti and manner of dress,\" none of which, attorneys argue, are \"reliable ways of identifying gang members.\"",
      "The Alien Enemies Act of 1798 has only been used three times, and all during declared wars.",
      "Attorneys in the New York case argued in their habeas petition that the two men \"and others similarly situated to them are now all at imminent risk of removal,\" under the Alien Enemies Act, adding that since Monday, \"the government is resuming its summary removals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including petitioners here, without any judicial review.\"",
      "The new cases were filed after the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to restart for now deportations of migrants it claims are members of a Venezuelan gang. But the court specified that any migrants facing removal under the Alien Enemies Act are subject to due process, and said that as of Monday night, detainees must receive notice that they are subject to deportation.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned opinion that \"the notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "The court also specified that any claims brought by migrants that the administration says are covered by Mr. Trump's proclamation belong in habeas corpus proceedings to be brought in the district where they are confined.",
      "While the high court struck down the judge's lower court block on further deportations under the statute after the Trump administration sent two planes carrying alleged gang members deported under the Alien Enemies Act to El Salvador, it also ruled that those subject to removal under the law are entitled to judicial review. There was no judicial review, multiple courts found, for over 230 migrants who were sent to El Salvador in March, where they remain detained at a maximum security prison there.",
      "Katrina  Kaufman\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice.

    "summary": "Asa Ellerup has come under public scrutiny following her husband's arrest for three of the Gilgo Beach murders, but the daughters of notorious serial killers BTK and the Happy Face Killer have come to her defense.",
    "story": [
      "When Rex Heuermann was charged in July 2023 for the murders of Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Lynn Costello, authorities announced he was also the prime suspect in the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes. Finally, investigators believed they had caught the elusive murderer of the \"Gilgo Four\" \u2014 the women discovered buried near Long Island's Gilgo Beach in 2010 and long suspected to be the victims of a serial killer.",
      "After his arrest, Heuermann's quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park, Long Island, was overrun by investigators and media, which focused intense scrutiny on his ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann; and his wife of more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "\"Their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of suspected serial killer,\" said Bob Macedonio, Ellerup's attorney.",
      "Macedonio, as well as co-workers of the suspect and the victims' families and friends, spoke to \"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty, who has reported on the case since the beginning. An encore of her latest report, \"The Gilgo Beach Serial Killings,\"\u00a0airs Saturday, April 12, 2025 at 9/8c on CBS and streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Macedonio began representing Ellerup shortly after Heuermann's arrest, when she filed for divorce. He says Ellerup was as stunned as anyone by the accusations against her estranged husband.",
      "\"She had no idea any of this was going on,\" said Macedonio of the accusations against Heuermann. \"Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.\"",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on Heuermann. Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney says investigators found strands of female hair on two of the victims that they believe could belong to Ellerup.",
      "\"One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent,\" said Tierney. \"And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.\"",
      "Investigators have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred. Tierney says that her hair may have simply gotten on the victims thanks to transfer.",
      "\"You live at home with a spouse, little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's,\" said Tierney. \"Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.\"",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders. When asked if he believed she might be involved in any way, Tierney said there is \"no evidence to indicate that.\"",
      "While Ellerup has received public scrutiny, she has also found sympathy \u2014including from Muriel Henriquez, a former co-worker of Rex Heuermann's at the architectural firm he owned called RH Consulting & Associates.",
      "Henriquez spoke to \"48 Hours\" exclusively and says that Heuermann gave her a sweater in 2007 that Ellerup had picked up while she was on a trip to her native Iceland. Henriquez wonders if Ellerup's trip out of the country might have given Heuermann the opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who disappeared that same summer. Henriquez has held onto the sweater and says it is a reminder of two women she believes are victims.",
      "\"Because the wife's a victim as well,\" said Henriquez. \"For him to ask her to bring back gifts for his employees, and then he's also \u2026 betraying her.\"",
      "Ellerup has also found support from those who perhaps know all too well what she might be going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\" Another person who has spoken out is Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jesperson, a serial killer known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" who taunted authorities with letters signed with a happy face.",
      "\"Today I have an opportunity to use my voice to help Asa,\" Moore said in a TikTok video she posted.",
      "Moore set up a GoFundMe page for Ellerup, which has raised over $50,000. It is money Ellerup's attorney says will largely go to medical bills, since she is battling breast and skin cancer. He says that because Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "\"Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received,\" Macedonio said in a news conference announcing the GoFundMe page. \"She is going through a very difficult time.\"",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Victoria Heuermann, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and Christopher Sheridan are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she is also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "\"She has no one else to turn to at this time,\" said Macedonio. \"Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention.\"",
      "For the moment, Ellerup and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged when police searched it shortly after Heuermann's arrest. It is a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes Rex Heuermann is charged with, as well as of the investigation that continues.",
      "\"We're going to prepare the 'Gilgo Four' case for trial,\" said Tierney. \"And we are going to expand our investigation.",
      "On Jan. 16, 2024, six months after his arrest, Rex Heuermann was charged with the murder of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.",

      "In the early morning hours of May 1, 2010, 23-year-old Shannan Gilbert, working as an escort, called 911.",
      "911 OPERATOR: State Police.",
      "SHANNAN GILBERT: Yeah, there's somebody after me.",
      "The call came from a neighborhood not far from Gilgo Beach.",
      "SHANNAN GILBERT (to 911): These people are trying to kill me.",
      "Shannan starts running, knocking on doors.",
      "911 OPERATOR: Where are you, Shannan?",
      "She screams. And then, nothing. Shannan was gone.",
      "911 OPERATOR: Hello? Hello?",
      "Dominick Varrone: K-9 \u2026 searched the area \u2026 exhaustively for Shannan Gilbert.",
      "Dominick Varrone was chief of detectives at the Suffolk County Police Department. Months passed without a sign of the missing woman. Then, in December 2010 near Gilgo Beach, a police officer and his K-9 named Blue found human remains.",
      "Dominick Varrone:\u00a0 Everyone assumed it was Shannan Gilbert.",
      "But it wasn't Shannan. Stunned searchers would go on to discover the remains of four other women. The women were identified as Maureen Brainard-Barnes, Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. Like Shannan, all were in their 20s. All were online escorts. All petite. Three of the four were wrapped in burlap \u2014 the kind you can find in hunting stores. They became known as the Gilgo Four.",
      "Missy Cann: It's really, really hard. \u2026'Cause I miss her so much.",
      "\"48 Hours\" has reported on this case since 2010. Over the years, we've secured exclusive interviews with the family and friends of the Gilgo Four. Missy Cann will never forget the wintry day when she got the devastating news.",
      "Missy Cann: The detectives came to my house and just said that Maureen has been positively identified as one of the victims on Ocean Parkway.",
      "Her sister, Maureen Brainard-Barnes, a mother of two, was the first to disappear, on July 9, 2007.",
      "Missy Cann: She was very smart and very creative.",
      "Erin Moriarty: She liked being a mom?",
      "Missy Cann: She loved being a mom.",
      "But life as a single mom living in Norwich, Connecticut, was difficult. Cann didn't know it, but Maureen had turned to escort work, and that July went to New York City for a weekend to make money. On her way home, she called Missy from Penn Station in midtown Manhattan.",
      "Missy Cann: I could hear the commotion \u2026 from the train station. \u2026 From the time that she called me, it was poof. She was gone.",
      "She reported Maureen missing. Eventually, officers would tell Cann that after her sister's disappearance, someone had used Maureen's cell phone to make a call from Long Island. It wasn't known then, but those two locations \u2013 Long Island and midtown Manhattan \u2013 would become important clues in the hunt for a serial killer.",
      "Nearly two years to the day that Maureen vanished, 24-year-old Melissa Barthelemy went missing in July 2009 \u2013 also from midtown Manhattan. Lynn Barthelemy is Melissa's mother.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How often do you think about Melissa?",
      "Lynn Barthelemy: Every single minute of the day. \u2026 And It just didn't happen to the girls. I mean it destroyed all of our families.",
      "Melissa moved from Buffalo to New York City to work as a hairdresser. At some point, she also began working as an escort and then disappeared. About a week after she went missing, Melissa's then-15-year-old sister, Amanda, started getting calls from Melissa's phone.",
      "Steven Cohen: And she answers, you know, \"Melissa, where have you been?\" \u2026 And this voice is saying, \"Oh, this isn't Melissa.\"",
      "Steven Cohen was the family's lawyer at the time.",
      "Steven Cohen: He \u2026 was taunting Amanda \u2026 and he said, \"Do you know what I did to your sister?\" \u2026\u00a0 \"I killed Melissa.\"",
      "Lynn Barthelemy: All I can say is he's sick. And he's going to make a mistake. And we're going to catch him.",
      "Those calls from Melissa's own phone may very well have been that mistake. When police traced them, the calls placed the person they believed to be Melissa's killer in midtown Manhattan.",
      "The following year, Megan Waterman, the mother of a 3-year-old girl, disappeared from a hotel on Long Island.",
      "Liliana Waterman: Part of you is, like, missing. It's just, like, something's always off.",
      "\"48 Hours\" spoke with Megan's daughter, Liliana, in 2020.",
      "Liliana Waterman: I would do anything to bring her back, but I can't and it just, like, frustrates me so bad.",
      "Megan's family says the 22-year-old was a creative, but troubled, young woman who loved fashion and was devoted to her daughter.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What would you say to your mom if you could?",
      "Liliana Waterman: I would just want to tell her that, like, I love her. \u2026 I just want her to know, like, she has a special place in my heart, no one can ever replace her.",
      "Like the other two women, Megan disappeared in the summer. On June 6, 2010, she was working as an escort on Long Island.",
      "Liliana Waterman: No matter what her job was \u2026 she was a person \u2026 and \u2026 she needs justice.",
      "Haunting video from a Holiday Inn Express is the last time she was seen alive \u2014 moments before she went to meet a client. Cellphone records later placed her phone in a Long Island neighborhood called Massapequa Park.",
      "Amber Costello was the last of the Gilgo Four to disappear. She lived seven-and-a-half miles from Massapequa Park.",
      "Dave Schaller: She used to say she was 4'11\", but she wasn't. She was like 4'9\", you know. I mean, she was small.",
      "Amber's friend and former roommate, Dave Schaller, spoke with \"48 Hours\" in 2011.",
      "Dave Schaller: She was an amazing person, she really was.",
      "He says Amber was addicted to drugs and used sex work to support her habit.",
      "Dave Schaller: But as amazing as she was, was as tormented as she was.",
      "After Amber disappeared, police say Schaller told them about her clients. He described one of them as looking like an \"ogre\" and having \"a first-generation Chevrolet Avalanche.\" On the night she went missing, Schaller says, a client offered Amber $1,500 for the night \u2013 six times her hourly rate.",
      "Dave Schaller: This guy was so relentless. \u2026 He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.",
      "He says the client got Amber, an experienced escort, to do something she never did: leave without her purse or cellphone and meet him in his car.",
      "Dave Schaller: I walked out the front door with her. She \u2013 she gave me a hug. \u2026 She's like, \"I love ya.\" And she left.",
      "It was nearly midnight. Schaller says that when Amber left their house, she walked down the street and he never saw her again.",
      "Schaller told \"48 Hours\" that he didn't see the client's face that night but suspects he had seen him before.",
      "Erin Moriarty: So, this is a guy you might have seen?",
      "Dave Schaller: Yeah, this is somebody that I seen. \u2026 I might be the \u2014 one of the only people who knows who he is.",
      "It would be more than a decade before Schaller's description would lead to a break in the case \u2014 and a prime suspect.",
      "WHO IS REX HEUERMANN?",
      "Muriel Henriquez: My co-worker called me and \u2026 she said, \"Did you hear what happened to Rex?\" And I'm like, \"no.\"",
      "NEWS REPORT: A New York City architect charged with murder.",

      "Mary Shell: I just didn't think it was real.",
      "Mary Shell: I even thought to myself, \"it's crazy that there's two Rex Heuermann's out there.\"",
      "Mary Shell and Muriel Henriquez worked with Rex Heuermann and couldn't wrap their heads around the news.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: We never thought he would be that kind of person.",
      "Mary Shell: It's shocking.",
      "In July 2023, nearly 13 years after the Gilgo Four were discovered, Suffolk County police commissioner Rodney Harrison made the announcement: authorities believe Rex Heuermann is the Long Island serial killer.",
      "RODNEY HARRISON (news conference): Rex Heuermann is a demon that walks among us, a predator that ruined families.",
      "The man he calls a demon is a six-foot-four architect. He's charged with killing Melissa Barthelemy, Megan Waterman and Amber Costello. And he is the prime suspect in the death of Maureen Brainard-Barnes.",
      "MICHAEL BROWN | REX HEUERMANN'S LAWYER (to reporters): What has my client told me? He told me he didn't do this.",
      "Heuermann was living about 20 minutes from Gilgo Beach, in Massapequa Park. It's the very same town where Megan's phone last connected with a cell tower. And Heuermann worked at his architectural firm in Midtown Manhattan, just blocks from where Maureen disappeared. The same area where several of the threatening calls to Melissa's little sister were made.",
      "NEWS CONFERENCE: The cause of death with regard to the three victims is homicidal violence.",
      "A married man, Heuermann lived in a run-down house, and has a daughter and stepson with his second wife, Asa Ellerup. Ellerup, who was born in Iceland, would take the children to see her family there in the summers. It was during these trips and others, police believe, that Heuermann killed the women.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You never got any kind of hint of another life?",
      "Muriel Henriquez: No, no.",
      "Muriel Henriquez worked at Heuermann's company, RH Consultants & Associates, and spoke exclusively to \"48 Hours.\" She recalled a gift he gave her in the summer of 2007.",
      "Muriel Henriquez (holding sweater): This is a sweater he asked his wife to bring back from a trip to Iceland.",
      "Henriquez, who says she was touched at the time by Heuermann's thoughtful gesture, now wonders if his wife's absence that summer gave him an opportunity to kill Maureen Brainard-Barnes, who disappeared on July 9, 2007.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How do you feel about this sweater now?",
      "Muriel Henriquez: No, I'm definitely not going to wear the sweater now.",
      "Still, she says she saw nothing alarming about the Rex Heuermann she saw daily.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: A little bit of a nerd in a way. \u2026 he liked to talk about himself, what he knew \u2026 not a narcissist, but a little bit of a, you know, I know everything kind of guy.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Pompous.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: Pompous.",
      "She remembers him running to and from job sites eating fast food on the run.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: Pizza. That was his number one thing.",
      "When she heard that police had recovered almost 300 firearms from a vault in Heuermann's basement, she was surprised only by the number. She knew him as an avid hunter.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: Going out shooting, hunting, that was his passion.",
      "Erin Moriarty: What was it about hunting he liked?",
      "Muriel Henriquez: I don't know. I guess \u2014 I guess it was like, he \u2014 he liked the idea of having a prize.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Stalking prey?",
      "Muriel Henriquez: Stalking prey and winning. He liked to win.",
      "And while she says it never occurred to her that Heuermann could be dangerous, she does remember a time when his tracking skills unnerved her. It was her 40th birthday and she had booked a cruise vacation.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: \"Where are you going?\" I said, \"I'm going to \u2014 you know, I'm going to be in the middle of the ocean. You're not going to find me in the middle of the ocean.\" \u2026 He said,\" Oh, yes, I can.\"",
      "Henriquez didn't think much of the comment, until the second day of her trip.",
      "Muriel Henriquez: There was a white envelope under my door \u2026 it was a note from him. The note said, \"I told you I could find you anywhere.\"",
      "Mary Shell: He had photos from hunting trips.",
      "Mary Shell was just out of art school in the summer of 2010 when she worked for Heuermann. It was the same summer that both Megan Waterman and Amber Costello vanished.",
      "Mary Shell: He would talk about the meat \u2026 in particular that bear meat could keep in the freezer for months.",
      "Hearing authorities now say some of the victims were wrapped in a burlap that hunters often use was chilling.",
      "Mary Shell: The burlap really got to me.",
      "Since Heuermann's arrest, Mary has written about her experience with him. She's also talked to other former female employees who said they weren't always treated with respect.",
      "Mary Shell: He would have one of them, uh, clean the toilet if he thought the cleaning person hadn't done a good enough job.",
      "Erin Moriarty: A woman in the office?",
      "Mary Shell: Yes. Mm-hmm. \u2026 he \u2014 more than once commented on women's bodies \u2026 if someone perhaps had gained some weight, you know, that kind of \u2014 that kind of thing.",
      "John Parisi grew up with Heuermann. He says Heuermann was bullied as a child.",
      "John Parisi: I remember meeting Rex when I was in first or second grade. \u2026 he was a loner, not many friends. \u2026 The children were super mean to him \u2026 made fun of him and teased him.",
      "But Parisi says he never saw Heuermann fight back.",
      "John Parisi: He was big enough that if he got upset and started swinging, he would hurt somebody. But he never did.",
      "As Heuermann got older, John points out, things didn't get much better.",
      "John Parisi: He was rejected by many girls. \u2026 we all go through that awkward stage growing up, and it seemed like that awkward stage stayed with him longer than usual.",
      "Still, he says, many in the community find it hard to believe that Heuermann is the notorious serial killer living a double life for more than a decade.",
      "John Parisi: People \u2026 were saying, oh my God, I can't believe we have a serial killer in our town, and we grew up with, and we walked amongst the killer.",
      "Another classmate of Heuermann's, actor Billy Baldwin, took to social media when the news broke, tweeting it was \"Mind-boggling.\"",

      "REX HEUERMANN: When a job that should have been routine suddenly becomes not routine, I get the phone call.",
      "ANTOINE AMIRA: Gotcha.",
      "Antoine Amira: What really, uh, uh, stood out for me was that he \u2014 he was very, very, very smart.",
      "And known, says Amira, for his ability to find loopholes in the rules.",
      "Antoine Amira: He was pleased when he was doing it.",
      "Erin Moriarty: That he could \u2014",
      "Antoine Amira: That he \u2014 could outwit the \u2014 the system.",
      "But Amira says he remembers it was hard to get Heuermann to crack a smile. Not even during the signature sunglasses selfies he takes with every guest.",
      "ANTOINE AMIRA (YouTube interview show): That's it, folks. That was Rex.",
      "ANTOINE AMIRA: It's. Selfie time. Can you smile?",
      "REX HEUERMANN: That is.",
      "If police are right, Rex Heuerman was able to hide a life as a serial killer \u2014 and if he did, his habit of eating pizza on the go would turn out to be his undoing.",
      "CONNECTING THE CLUES",
      "For more than a decade after the discovery of the Gilgo Four, Rex Heuermann's name never appeared on a suspect list until a new task force was formed with Suffolk County police commissioner Rodney Harrison and Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney.",
      "Ray Tierney: In February of 2022 we formed the task force \u2026 and then a mere six weeks later \u2026 Rex Heuermann was identified for the first time.",
      "A suspect in six weeks? So how did they do it? It turns out that buried in the original case files were a number of critical clues that the new task force was finally able to connect. Remember Amber's roommate Dave Schaller?",
      "Dave Schaller:\u00a0 She's like, \"I love you.\"\u00a0 You know, she gave me a hug. \u2026 And she left.",
      "He had told police about one of Amber's clients and his vehicle.",
      "Ray Tierney: Just a large, built man \u2026 and that, he was driving this, this first-generation Chevy Avalanche.",
      "A first-generation Chevy Avalanche. With a description of an ogre-like man, and the make and model of his truck, police took a closer look at Amber's phone records from 2010. Schaller had told them that before Amber disappeared, there was one particular client calling incessantly.",
      "Dave\u00a0Schaller: He called several times. He was on the phone with her for quite a while each time.",
      "Police back then knew the client was using a burner phone. That's a prepaid phone that anyone can buy and use anonymously. And they knew that Maureen, Melissa and Megan had all been in contact with burner numbers right before they disappeared.",
      "In 2012, with the help of the FBI, they determined that most of those calls connected to cell towers inside a small area of Massapequa Park. They called it \"the box.\"",
      "Erin Moriarty: So how large an area is that box?",
      "Ray Tierney: It's, you know, a couple of blocks within \u2014 within Massapequa Park.",
      "The new task force began the search for a large-built man who also lived in that small area and owned a Chevy Avalanche at the time of the disappearances.",
      "Erin Moriarty: Was there a \"aha!\" moment when, all of a sudden, his name came up?",
      "Rodney Harrison: Once we were able to attach the \u2026 Avalanche inside of that Massapequa box, which then attached to Rex Heuermann, that was a moment where we said, OK, there's something here.",
      "The task force now had a prime suspect. And when they looked at Heuermann's personal cellphone records, they found that his phone was in the same area as those burner phones when they were used to contact a victim in Massapequa Park or in midtown Manhattan.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): it was always consistent.",
      "Tierney says this was also true for those awful calls Melissa's family got from that man using her phone back in 2009.",
      "Steve Cohen: He said, \"Do you know what I did to your sister?\" \u2026 and he said \u2026 \u00a0\"Well, I killed Melissa.\"",
      "The task force says that it confirmed that Heuermann does in fact use burner phones. Investigators say he had two different burner numbers in 2022, and they say they watched him put money on one of those accounts at a cellphone store in Midtown Manhattan.",
      "And according to court papers, the team also documented three email accounts using fake names, including John Springfield, Thomas Hawk and Hunter1903a3, and all linked to those burner numbers. And prosecutors say that Heuermann was using a burner phone to send these selfies to \"solicit and arrange for sexual activity.\"",
      "One of those accounts linked to Heuermann, prosecutors wrote, was used to conduct \"thousands of searches related to sex workers, sadistic, torture-related pornography and child pornography.\"",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): There was a lot of torture, porn, and \u2026 depictions of women, being abused, being raped, and being killed.",
      "Investigators also say that while they were busy watching Heuermann, Heuermann was trying to watch them \u2014 conducting searches on the task force and the Gilgo victims.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): Not only pictures of the victims, pictures of their relatives \u2026 their sisters, their children, and he was trying to locate those individuals.",
      "The circumstantial evidence was building, but investigators also had physical evidence from the Gilgo Four\u2014including one male hair that was found in the burlap used to \"restrain and transport\" Megan Waterman's body. They wanted to see if they could link it to Heuermann.",
      "Police tailed Heuermann, and when he threw out a pizza box in a trash can in midtown Manhattan \u2014 they pounced.",
      "Ray Tierney: The pizza, which was \u2026 obviously very significant.",
      "Tierney says that Heuermann's DNA that was found on that pizza crust was consistent with a DNA profile from the hair found with Megan Waterman's body, and that DNA profile is only found in .04 percent of the population.",
      "Ray Tierney: That was a remarkable day. It was, you know, the weekend and, you know, you read, you get the report and you read it and then you read it again, and then you read it a third time and then you read it a fourth time, and then you start making calls.",
      "With the DNA, the search histories and the burner phone evidence, the team felt it was time.",
      "Ray Tierney: When we decided to take down the case, we, you know, it was a sudden decision. \u2026 We did see him contacting a number \u2014 of sex workers \u2026 using a burner phone, which obviously is concerning.",
      "Plainclothes officers arrested him around the corner from his office.",
      "Rodney Harrison: I don't think he had any clue. I don't think he had any clue that we were onto him.",
      "Police spent 12 days looking through Heuermann's home, pulling those guns out of the basement, and digging in the backyard. They say it will take some time to comb through what they have now, and they were tight lipped about what they found.",
      "REPORTER 1 (at news conference): Has the search been fruitful?",
      "RODNEY HARRISON: Great question and the answer's yes.",
      "REPORTER 2: \u2026 Can you elaborate on fruitful? You said yes, it's fruitful.",
      "RODNEY HARRISON: There have been items that we have taken into our possession, that makes it fruitful.",
      "And one more big piece of evidence taken into possession: a first-generation Chevy Avalanche Heuermann once used. It was sitting on property he owns in South Carolina when they recovered it.",
      "RAY TIERNEY (at news conference): We were able to seize that Chevy Avalanche pursuant to a search warrant. And we're certainly going to analyze that.",

      "THE FAMILY OF A SUSPECTED SERIAL KILLER",
      "After Rex Heuermann's arrest, his quiet neighborhood in Massapequa Park was overrun by investigators and media, focusing intense scrutiny on the ramshackle home and its remaining residents: his stepson, Christopher Sheridan; daughter, Victoria Heuermann, and his wife more than 25 years, Asa Ellerup.",
      "Bob Macedonio: So, their life going forward is always gonna be the wife or the children of (a) suspected serial killer. That's what it's gonna be from now on.",
      "Attorney Bob Macedonio represents Ellerup, who has since filed for divorce from Heuermann. He says she was as stunned as anyone by the accusations.",
      "Bob Macedonio: She had no idea any of this was going on \u2026 The allegations are shocking. Nobody wants to think that they've been living with, sleeping next to a serial killer for the past 25 years.",
      "As it turns out, Ellerup may have inadvertently helped focus the investigation on her husband. Investigators say they've identified strands of female hair that were found on two of the victims.",
      "D.A. Ray Tierney | Suffolk County: One hair on Waterman \u2026 comes back to his wife, or the DNA profiles are consistent. And then \u2026 the DNA profile from Costello is consistent with \u2026 the wife.",
      "Although prosecutors have evidence that Ellerup was out of town when those murders occurred, they will have to explain how those hairs got on the victims. Suffolk County D.A. Ray Tierney says it could be as simple as transfer.",
      "Ray Tierney: You live at home with a spouse a little bit of your hair falls on your shoulder, as well as your spouse's. Then you go out and you interact with the third party and that hair gets on them.",
      "Ellerup has not been charged or named a suspect in any of the murders.",
      "Erin Moriarty: You don't believe that Rex Heuermann's wife was involved in this in any way?",
      "Ray Tierney: There's no evidence to indicate that. No.",
      "Along with the public scrutiny of Ellerup, there has also been support from people that perhaps know all too well what she's going through. Kerri Rawson, the daughter of serial killer Dennis Rader, who named himself BTK, tweeted: \"Asa and her kids are also victims.\"",
      "MELISSA MOORE (at news conference): I can tell that they are going through hell.",
      "And from Melissa Moore, the daughter of Keith Jesperson \u2014 a serial killer known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" for taunting authorities with letters signed with a happy face.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): She reached out immediately to myself and we put her in contact with Asa.",
      "At a news conference, Macedonio announced Moore set up a GoFundMe page for Ellerup, which raised over $50,000. It is money he says will largely go to medical bills \u2014 Asa is battling breast and skin cancer. And because Rex Heuermann was the sole provider for the family, Macedonio says she will soon lose her health insurance.",
      "BOB MACEDONIO (at news conference): Asa would like me to express her thanks for the support she has received. Um, she is going through a very difficult time.",
      "Ellerup's children have also paid a heavy price. Her daughter, Victoria, who worked for her father at the architectural consulting firm, and her son, Christopher, are both now unemployed. Ellerup struggles to support them, says Macedonio, while she's also trying to figure out how to start over.",
      "Erin Moriarty: How is she getting through every day?",
      "Bob Macedonio: Honestly?",
      "Erin Moriarty: Yeah.",
      "Bob Macedonio: Minute by minute. \u2026 She has no one else to turn into at this time. \u2026 Family and friends have been hesitant to have her come over because they don't want the media attention. She gets followed wherever she goes.",
      "For the moment, she and her children continue to live in the house in Massapequa Park, which the family says was excessively damaged during the police search. It's a daily reminder of the unimaginable crimes her estranged husband is charged with and the investigation that continues into what else he may have done.",
      "THE ONE WHO GOT AWAY?",

    "story": [
      "China said it is raising its tariffs on U.S. products to 84%, up from its previously announced 34%, after President Trump's import duties on Chinese good\u00a0went into effect today at a rate of 104%.",
      "Mr. Trump's broad-based tariffs, which apply to imports of almost every nation, kicked in after midnight Eastern time in the U.S. But on Wednesday afternoon the president announced he is pausing most of the new import taxes for 90 days and lowering the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10%, effective immediately,",
      "At the same time, Mr. Trump said he's increasing the tariff on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "\"Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World's Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\" he wrote on Truth Social.",
      "The president continued, \"At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\"",
      "China decries U.S. \"mistake\"",
      "China's announcement signals Beijing isn't backing down in a global trade war sparked by Mr. Trump's April 2 decision to levy so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on almost every nation. In response to that announcement, China said it would counter by placing the same duty \u2014 34% at the time \u2014 on U.S. imports, which prompted Mr. Trump to slap another 50% tariff on Chinese imports.",
      "Mr. Trump's tariffs be paid by U.S. companies that import products from China. Those companies are likely to pass on the cost of all or some of the import duties to American consumers, hiking prices on everything from iPhones to clothing made in China, according to experts.",
      "In an April 9 statement, China said called Mr. Trump's decision to add another 50% tariff as a \"mistake upon a mistake.\" It also called Mr. Trump's tariffs as an example of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying.\"",
      "Wednesday's newest measures from Beijing include adding 11 American companies to a so-called \"unreliable entities\" list that would bar Chinese companies from selling them dual-use goods. Among the companies are American Photonics, and SYNEXXUS, both of whom work with the American military.",
      "So far, China has not appeared interested in bargaining. \"If the U.S. truly wants to resolve issues through dialogue and negotiation, it should adopt an attitude of equality, respect and mutual benefit,\" said Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Lin Jian Wednesday.",
      "China now controls about 35% of the world's manufacturing, compared with 12% for the U.S.,\u00a0according to the Centre for Economic Policy Research. Beijing has also expanded its exports to other countries, particularly developing nations, as it seeks to lessen its reliance on the U.S., research group Onyx Strategic Insights noted in a recent report.",
      "\"China has spent the last five years Trump-proofing its economy \u2014 it has been working to nationalize supply chains, it has been working to penetrate different export markets, particularly in the developing world,\" Scott Lincicome, a trade expert at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch. China is \"willing to endure the pain, thinking they can handle it longer than we can, and they might have a point.\"",
      "China was the third-largest export market for the U.S. in 2023, following Canada and Mexico, with $145 billion in goods shipped to the Asian nation that year, according to the U.S.-China Business Council. Oilseeds and grains are the top export that the U.S. sends to China, followed by oil and gas.",
      "EU also hitting back",
      "Separately, the European Union on Wednesday announced its own retaliatory measures against the U.S. The 27-country trading bloc announced tariffs on more than $22 billion in U.S. products, including soybeans, motorcycles and beauty products, according to AFP.",

    "summary": "The discovery shows the cultural interaction between the Maya of Tikal and Teotihuacan's elite between 300 and 500 A.D., archaeologists said.",
    "story": [
      "An altar from the Teotihuacan culture, at the pre-Hispanic heart of what became Mexico, was discovered in Tikal National Park in Guatemala, the center of Mayan culture, demonstrating the interaction between the two societies, Guatemala's Culture and Sports Ministry announced this week.",
      "The enormous city-state of Tikal, whose towering temples still stand in the jungle, battled for centuries with the Kaanul dynasty for dominance of the Maya world.",
      "Far to the north in Mexico, just outside present day Mexico City, Teotihuacan \u2014 \"the city of the gods\" or \"the place where men become gods\" \u2014 is best known for its twin Temples of the Sun and Moon. It was actually a large city that housed over 100,000 inhabitants and covered around 8 square miles.",
      "The still mysterious city was one of the largest in the world at its peak between 100 B.C. and A.D. 750. But it was abandoned before the rise of the Aztecs in the 14th century.",
      "Lorena Paiz, the archaeologist who led the discovery, said that the Teotihuacan altar was believed to have been used for sacrifices, \"especially of children.\"",
      "\"The remains of three children not older than 4 years were found on three sides of the altar,\" Paiz told The Associated Press.",
      "\"The Teotihuacan were traders who traveled all over the country (Guatemala),\" Paiz said. \"The Teotihuacan residential complexes were houses with rooms and in the center altars; that's what the residence that was found is like, with an altar with the figure representing the Storm Goddess.\"",
      "Researchers posted video on social media showing aerial footage of the altar as well as detail of the structure's interior.",
      "\"It's something unique in Guatemala, nothing similar had been found,\" Paiz said in a statement.",
      "It took archaeologists 1\u00bd years to uncover the altar in a dwelling and analyze it before the announcement.",
      "Edwin Rom\u00e1n, who leads the South Tikal Archaeological Project within the park, said the discovery shows the sociopolitical and cultural interaction between the Maya of Tikal and Teotihuacan's elite between 300 and 500 A.D.",
      "Rom\u00e1n said the discovery also reinforces the idea that Tikal was a cosmopolitan center at that time, a place where people visited from other cultures, affirming its importance as a center of cultural convergence.",
      "Mar\u00eda Bel\u00e9n M\u00e9ndez, an archaeologist who was not involved with the project, said the discovery confirms \"that there has been an interconnection between both cultures and what their relationships with their gods and celestial bodies was like.\"",
      "\"We see how the issue of sacrifice exists in both cultures. It was a practice; it's not that they were violent, it was their way of connecting with the celestial bodies,\" she said.",
      "The altar is just over a yard wide from east to west and about 2 yards from north to south. It is about a yard tall and covered with limestone.",
      "The dwelling where it was found had anthropomorphic figures with tassels in red tones, a detail from the Teotihuacan culture, according to the ministry's statement.",
      "The\u00a0researchers published their findings in the archaeological journal Antiquity.",
      "The researchers made their announcement less than a year after a hidden Mayan city was\u00a0discovered in a dense Mexican jungle by a doctoral student who unknowingly drove past the site years ago on a visit to Mexico.",
      "Tikal National Park is about 325 miles north of Guatemala City, and the discovery site is guarded and there are no plans to open it to the public. Tikal, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, reached its peak between 200 and 900 AD when Mayan culture encompassed parts of what are now Guatemala, Mexico, Belize, El Salvador and Honduras.",

      "On April 2, Mr. Trump announced what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\" on virtually every nation the U.S. does trade with. Despite stock markets around the globe descending into tumult and economists warning for months that it will be consumers who pay the price for the levies, Mr. Trump has not backed down, insisting the measures will help the U.S. balance its trade deficit with other nations in the longer term.",
      "But in the near term, many Americans' adult beverages of choice, including European wines and Scotch whisky, are likely to come at more of a premium, according to industry insiders.",
      "Bartholomew Broadbent, who owns the Virginia-based wine wholesaler and importer Broadbent Selections, warned the impact on retail prices in the U.S. is going to be \"a lot worse than people think.\"",
      "French wines, as an example, will be subject to 20% tariffs under the measures announced by Mr. Trump. But Broadbent told CBS News the real-world price increase will be closer to 30%, because the cost of the tariff will be compounded at every stage of a bottle or crate's journey to a store shelf \u2014 with producers in France and other nations, along with importers like himself and then distributors and retailers all adding their own mark-ups.",
      "\"The price is going to have to go up,\" he said.",
      "In real terms, Broadbent estimated that the retail price on a bottle of wine that currently sells for $9.99 could go up to $13 or $14.",
      "Broadbent, whose company imports wines from 11 different countries and it also works with wineries in California, said more than 80% of his business will now face new tariffs. Wines from South Africa will be the most heavily impacted, he said, as the White House has hit the country with a steep 30% tariff.",
      "\"I don't see a single person who can benefit from this,\" Broadbent said. \"Even the wineries in America will suffer badly because they're all buying barrels and corks from Europe.\"",
      "The tariffs sent shockwaves through the global wine industry, with France's Bourgogne Wine Board (BIVB) warning the levies risked \"pushing our wines past a psychological price threshold.\"",
      "Bourgogne \u2014 or the Burgundy region as it's known in English \u2014 exported nearly 21 million bottles of wine to the U.S. in 2024, according to the BIVB, which agreed with the assessment that Mr. Trump's tariffs will have a negative impact on everyone, from French exporters and their distributor partners to American consumers.",
      "\"The industry deeply regrets this decision,\" the BIVB said in a press release",
      "The people who make, sell and enjoy Scotland's world renowned distilled spirits are also staring down the barrel of Mr. Trump's tariffs. Last year alone, about 132 million bottles of Scotch whisky were imported into the U.S. market, according to the Scotch Whisky Association.",
      "The mood in Scotland is one of \"frustration and uncertainty,\" according to Drew McKenzie Smith, who founded and runs the Lindores Abbey Distillery just north of Edinburgh.",
      "McKenzie Smith estimated that the 10% baseline tariff Mr. Trump imposed on the U.K. would see the price of a bottle of his Scotch hiked by about the same amount for American consumers. So a bottle that currently costs $60 will soon jump to $66, be believes.",
      "While that \"may not sound severe,\" McKenzie Smith told CBS News, \"it still adds a meaningful burden \u2014 especially for smaller producers like us.\"",

      "Beijing\u00a0\u2014 China said Tuesday it would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the United States to safeguard its own interests after President Trump threatened an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports. The Commerce Ministry said the U.S.'s imposition of \"so-called 'reciprocal tariffs'\" on China was \"completely groundless and is a typical unilateral bullying practice.\"",
      "China, the world's second-largest economy, has imposed retaliatory tariffs and the ministry hinted in its latest statement that more may be coming.",
      "\"The countermeasures China has taken are aimed at safeguarding its sovereignty, security and development interests, and maintaining the normal international trade order. They are completely legitimate,\" the ministry said. \"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S. China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\"",

      "Mr. Trump's threat Monday of additional tariffs on China raised fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war. Stock markets from Tokyo to New York have become more unstable as the tariff war worsens and economists have warned that the odds of a global recession are rising fast.",
      "Mr. Trump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week.",
      "\"If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" the president wrote on his own Truth Social platform. \"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\"",
      "If Mr. Trump implements his new tariffs on Chinese products, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners, particularly the European Union.",

      "During a phone call with Chinese Prime Minister Li Qiang on Tuesday, Von der Leyen \"stressed the responsibility of Europe and China, as two of world's largest markets, to support a strong reformed trading system, free, fair and founded on a level playing field,\" according to a statement from her office.",
      "The statement said the leaders had discussed establishing a mechanism to track any diversions of goods caused by the U.S. levies on trade, amid concern in Europe that China could try to divert cheap exports that had been destined for the U.S. to the EU market. Such diversions could amount to what is called \"dumping\" in international trade, a practice that can saturate a market with underpriced goods at the expense of domestic producers and sellers.",

      "Zelenskyy said a clash with Chinese soldiers occurred near the villages of Tarasivka and Bilohorivka in the Donetsk region, where six Chinese military personnel engaged Ukrainian troops. Two Chinese were taken prisoner, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in Kyiv alongside visiting Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever.",
      "Zelenskyy said China would be the third country to offer military support to the Kremlin after Iran, which has supplied attack drones, and North Korea. The U.S. and Europe have been Ukraine's biggest backers in the war.",

      "Stocks in the U.S. look poised for another bruising day, with futures on leading indexes pointing south and following a wave of selling overseas amid mounting investor fears over the economic fallout from the\u00a0Trump administration's barrage of tariffs.",
      "Two hours before markets opened in New York, futures on the S&P 500 were down 92 points, or 1.8%. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures, which had fallen roughly 1,250 points in earlier trading on Monday, pared those losses and were down 900 points, or 2.3%, while Nasdaq Composite futures were off 2.1%.",
      "In Asia, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index tumbled 7.8%. Hong Kong's Hang Seng plunged 13.2% \u2014 its steepest drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis \u2014 and the Shanghai Composite index lost 7.3%. In Taiwan, the Taiex fell 9.7%, its heaviest loss on record. South Korea's Kospi dropped 5.6%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined 4.2%.",
      "European shares followed Asian markets downhill. Germany's DAX index was down 5.8% in morning trade. Paris' CAC 40 also shed 5.8%, and Britain's FTSE 100 lost 4.9%.",
      "\"Game of chicken\"",
      "Stock markets around the world sold off last week after President Trump on April 2 announced a minimum\u00a010% tariff\u00a0on all U.S. imports and\u00a0\"reciprocal\" levies\u00a0on nearly 90 countries. The global tariff took effect on Saturday, while the matching tariffs are set to hit on April 9.",
      "The scale of the tariffs has surprised investors, sending U.S. stocks into their sharpest decline in five years and wiping out trillions in investor wealth. Many economists warn that imposing broad tariffs on goods shipped into the U.S. could drive up inflation, chill spending by consumers and hurt economic growth.",
      "Retaliating against the U.S., China said Friday it will place a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products starting April 10. Beijing in March also started charging a 15% tax on American farm products, including chicken, pork and soy beans.",
      "\"China and the U.S. are now locked in a game of chicken, with the risk of a severe global trade war looming over financial markets,\" analysts with Pantheon Macroeconomics told investors in a note.",
      "The S&P 500 has declined nearly 14% since Mr. Trump unveiled the latest tariffs last week, while the blue-chip Dow is down 12%. The Nasdaq has decreased nearly 16% over that period, putting the tech-heavy index in a bear market \u2014 when stocks fall at least 20% from their most recent high.",
      "Highest tariffs since 1909",
      "Since re-entering the White House in January, Mr. Trump has also slapped 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, sharply raised import duties on Chinese goods, and put 25% levies on foreign cars, among other measures aimed at U.S. trading partners.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate on imported goods is now at its highest level since 1909, according to the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Mr. Trump said Sunday that he won't retreat from his tariffs unless other nations even out their trade with the U.S.",
      "Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, the president said he didn't want global markets to fall but that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"",
      "Senior Trump administration officials have staunchly defended their trade policies, saying on Sunday that more than 50 countries subject to the latest round of tariffs have requested talks.",
      "Speaking on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the tariffs are \"definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks. The president needs to reset global trade.\"",
      "Despite last week's market rout, some Wall Street economists expect the Trump administration to ease tariffs on certain countries in the months ahead in return for their lowering trade barriers. That would likely help shore up stocks.",
      "\"Our assumption is that, over the next few months Trump will make 'deals' with many countries, although China may be the exception,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a research note. \"Once it becomes clear that he is willing to accept relatively minor concessions in exchange for scaling back those tariffs, equities should rebound.\"",

But then the Ocean County Board decided to open a warming center, and according to Rodrick, nonprofits began \"bussing people into town.\"",
      "Rodrick said he raised his concerns to the board, but \"they did it anyway and engaged a nonprofit that has various warming centers across the state and, inevitably, they start bussing people into town. Because if their beds are full in one town, they're incentivized to hang on to these people, and they start putting them in your warming center.\"",
      "\"We wound up with dozens and dozens of people being dropped off downtown every single day at the library no less, where a mom should feel comfortable walking into the library with her daughter and get a book. You shouldn't have to walk through gangs of two dozen intoxicated or mentally ill homeless individuals, and that's the real issue here,\" adding there have been numerous police and EMS calls since March from the library.",
      "He also claims that there is \"a lot of money that chases around this issue.\"",
      "\"One of these nonprofits, he formed a nonprofit, this guy, and within a few short years he's bringing in almost a million dollars in revenue, $750,000 according to charitable organization reports,\" Rodrick said, while declining to call out a specific charity.",

      "Using advanced cardiac imaging, the researchers found that traditional cholesterol markers (ApoB and LDL-C) were not associated with changes in plaque levels in the heart\u2019s arteries or with baseline heart disease over a one-year period.",

      "'I'M A HEART SURGEON AND THIS IS WHAT I COOK FOR DINNER'",
      "\"Therefore, we should likely shift away from LDL and ApoB and toward vascular imaging with CAC or CTA for better risk prediction and informing how or if to treat someone's cardiac risk factors,\" added the California-based doctor.",

      "Dr. Nick Norwitz, a study leader and independent researcher at the University of Oxford, noted that this is the first study to isolate very high LDL and ApoB as risk factors for heart disease.",

      "This will be the first time the United States government has applied the use of artificial intelligence for federal employee record-keeping after President Donald Trump issued an executive order in January to \"solidify [America\u2019s] position as the global leader in AI and secure a brighter future for all Americans.\"",
      "A senior White House official spoke with Fox News Digital, outlining the implementation process, detailing that the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)-approved AI system will be used to drastically speed up the retirement process for the roughly 2.3 million federal employees and improve the accuracy of what is now mostly paper-based record keeping.",

The senior White House official explained that the artificial intelligence program has already been tested to 100% accuracy in a simulated environment, but that no testing on actual data can be completed without the updated PIA.",
      "Part of the inspiration for using AI to improve federal record keeping comes from\u00a0Elon Musk\u2019s DOGE keying in on a decommissioned, underground mine in Boyers, Pennsylvania.

      "X, formerly known as Twitter, has been making headlines recently, with Elon Musk claiming that hackers have been trying to disrupt the platform. However, the most recent news involving the social media site is particularly alarming and puts its users at serious risk.",
      "Earlier this month, reports emerged of a major data breach involving X, after a self-proclaimed data enthusiast known as \"ThinkingOne\" claimed to have released a database containing over 200 million user records on a popular hacker forum. The leaked data includes names, email addresses and nearly everything else associated with a user\u2019s X profile.",

      "What you need to know",
      "The X data leak is believed to stem from a combination of breaches, including a massive one that allegedly occurred in January 2025 and another in 2023. The leaked dataset, reportedly a 34 GB CSV file, contains 201,186,753 entries with information such as X screen names, user IDs, full names, locations, email addresses (from the 2023 breach), follower counts, profile data, time zones and profile images.",
      "ThinkingOne claimed that the data was cross-referenced from a larger breach involving 2.8 billion unique Twitter IDs and screen names. This breach may have been linked to an insider job during layoffs at X, although the company has not verified this claim. Cybersecurity researchers, including those from\u00a0Safety Detectives, partially confirmed the authenticity of the data by matching a sample with public X profiles and verifying some email addresses. However, they were not able to fully confirm ownership.",
      "The breach appears to trace back to a vulnerability identified in January 2022 through Twitter\u2019s bug bounty program. This flaw allowed attackers to access user data using only an email address or phone number. Although the vulnerability was patched, the compromised data seems to have resurfaced in later leaks.",

      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "The data breach puts X users at risk",
      "The 2025 incident alone does not include passwords or financial information, but when combined with the email addresses from the 2023 leak, it significantly increases the risk of phishing and social engineering attacks. X has not officially acknowledged this specific breach at the time of writing, although it previously downplayed the 2023 incident by claiming it involved mostly public data.",
      "The total of 2.8 billion records far exceeds X\u2019s estimated 335 to 600 million active users, suggesting that the dataset may include inactive accounts, bots or historical data. While the full scope and impact of the breach remain unclear, the incident highlights ongoing security challenges for the platform, especially following its acquisition by xAI in late March 2025.",

      "HOW TO REMOVE YOUR PRIVATE DATA FROM THE INTERNET",
      "7 ways you can stay safe from the X data breach",
      "If you have an account on X or think your data may have been part of the breach, here are seven important steps you can take to protect yourself.",
      "1) Use strong antivirus software",
      "This breach included email addresses linked to X accounts, prime fuel for phishing attacks. Hackers may now send emails that look like they\u2019re from X, Musk or support, asking you to \"verify your account\" or \"reset your password.\" These often contain links or attachments that can install malware or steal personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2) Remove your personal data from the internet",
      "Since this X leak exposed full names, email addresses and other public-facing profile details, hackers can easily cross-reference it with other data broker sites to build a full profile on you. This could lead to impersonation or spear-phishing.",
      "To reduce your exposure, use a trusted data removal service that scans data broker websites and requests the deletion of your personal information. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3) Change your X account password",
      "Even though this particular breach may not have included passwords, there\u2019s still a significant risk, especially if you use the same password across multiple platforms. Once attackers have your email, they often try using it with common or previously leaked passwords to break into accounts.",
      "To change your X account password, go to Settings and privacy from your profile menu, then select\u00a0Your account and tap on\u00a0Change your password. Enter your current password, set a new strong password and confirm the change. You can do this via the mobile app or by logging in through the web. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "4) Make your X profile more private to reduce future risk",
      "Adjust your X account's privacy settings to limit the visibility of personal information, such as making your profile private. Ensure that only necessary information is publicly visible. Information that seems harmless, like your location, job title or birthday, can be used by cybercriminals to impersonate you or guess your login credentials. If your X profile includes any personal details that aren\u2019t necessary, now is the time to remove them.",
      "Keeping your profile minimal not only protects your privacy but also makes it harder for scammers to craft convincing phishing messages or social engineering attacks. Think twice before posting personal updates or details publicly, especially if they can be used to guess passwords or verify your identity.",
      "Go to\u00a0Settings > Privacy and safety and lock down your account visibility.",
      "5) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) for your X and email accounts",
      "If hackers got your email from the X breach, they may try to reset your password.\u00a02FA helps stop this by requiring a second code to log in:",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be interceptedSecure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy, not SMS, which can be intercepted",
      "Secure your email accounts, too, since they can be used to reset your X credentials",
      "6) Use a VPN on public Wi-Fi",
      "Protect your data when accessing X or other platforms on public networks by using a VPN to encrypt your connection. This will help safeguard your information from being intercepted by malicious actors. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7) Sign up for identity theft protection to catch if your X-linked info is abused",
      "With 200-plus million names and email addresses exposed, scammers may try opening accounts in your name or use your email in fraud attempts. Good identity protection can alert you if your info is being sold on the dark web. It can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my\u00a0tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "NEW PHISHING SCAM OUTSMARTS SECURITY CODES TO STEAL YOUR INFO",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The X breach is yet another reminder that patching a vulnerability is only one piece of a much larger puzzle. The persistence of leaked data \u2013 years after the original flaw was disclosed and fixed \u2013 highlights the long tail of exposure that comes with large-scale breaches. Even when credentials aren\u2019t involved, the combination of identifiers like email addresses, names and social connections can be weaponized through correlation attacks, data enrichment and AI-assisted social engineering.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "SafetyCore is an interesting addition to Android, offering on-device content filtering with machine learning. While it aims to enhance privacy and security, some users might have questions about its presence and functionality.

      "What is doubleclickjacking?",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a new spin on an old hacking trick known as clickjacking. Normally, clickjacking works by hiding malicious buttons underneath real ones, so when you think you\u2019re clicking something harmless, you\u2019re actually giving permission for something dangerous. With doubleclickjacking, it takes things a step further. It\u2019s triggered when you double-click, allowing hackers to sneak in an extra, invisible command. Your first click might do something normal. The second click? That\u2019s where the damage happens.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "Click \"Allow\" on a hidden pop-up",
      "Share your location",
      "Approve a login, payment or even a crypto transaction",
      "What makes doubleclickjacking especially dangerous is that most websites weren\u2019t designed to defend against it. Traditional security features usually protect against a single click, but they often fail when a second click is involved. That small detail opens the door for attackers to bypass layers of protection.",
      "This trick doesn\u2019t just affect websites, either. It can also interfere with browser extensions like crypto wallets and VPNs, sometimes tricking users into approving actions or turning off protection without realizing it. On mobile devices, a simple double-tap can trigger the same effect. To make matters worse, this vulnerability is more widespread than you might expect. Many well-known websites haven\u2019t fixed it yet. All it takes is one quick double-click in the wrong place, and you could unknowingly give away access to sensitive parts of your device.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "How does doubleclickjacking work?",
      "Here\u2019s a simplified version of how the trick plays out. A malicious website quietly loads invisible elements behind or over visible ones, like an embedded frame, hidden button, or disguised pop-up. On your first click, the attacker uses that action to reposition those hidden elements so that your next click lands exactly where they want it. On your second click, you unknowingly interact with the hidden content. You might be clicking \"Allow\" on a browser permission, authorizing a login, or disabling a setting, without ever realizing it. Because modern browsers are lightning fast, this all happens in a split second. The entire setup and switch are virtually invisible to the user. From your perspective, it just feels like a normal double-click.",

      "1. Be cautious about double-clicking on unfamiliar websites: It might sound obvious, but most of us click (and double-click) automatically. If a site prompts you to double-click anything, especially for a login, permission or download, ask yourself if it\u2019s really necessary. Hackers rely on you acting quickly without thinking.",
      "2. Keep your browser updated: Browsers like Chrome, Edge and Safari regularly release patches for these vulnerabilities. That means delaying updates could leave you exposed to tricks like doubleclickjacking. Turn on automatic updates if possible, or make sure to manually keep up with updates so you\u2019re always protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Browser-based tools and extensions can help block hidden or malicious scripts before they run, but they\u2019re not foolproof. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords for every account:\u00a0Don\u2019t reuse passwords. If one account gets compromised, hackers can use it to access your other accounts. A password manager helps you create and store strong passwords effortlessly. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "5. Limit unnecessary permissions: Take control of your privacy by reviewing which websites have access to your camera, microphone, and location. Many sites request these permissions by default, even when they don\u2019t need them. Head into your browser\u2019s privacy settings and revoke access from any site you don\u2019t fully trust. For example, here's a guide on\u00a0how to navigate Google's privacy settings.",
      "6. Avoid sketchy sites and pop-ups: If a website looks outdated, spammy or aggressively pushes you to click something, get out of there. Avoid downloading random files, and don\u2019t trust pop-ups that claim you\u2019ve won something, need to \"fix\" your device or \"verify\" your login info.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Doubleclickjacking is a clever new spin on a classic hacking trick that allows cybercriminals to take control over your device or account, just from a simple double-click. Because this kind of attack is nearly invisible and works on popular browsers, it\u2019s important to stay alert. Always be cautious when interacting with unfamiliar websites, especially if you're being asked to double-click. Keeping your browser updated and limiting unnecessary permissions can go a long way in reducing your risk. Most importantly, having the right digital protection tools in place can help stop these types of threats before they ever reach you.",

      "Tom from Carol Stream, Illinois, reached out to us with this same problem: \"When I\u2019m out of town and my internet goes down, all of my \u2018internet of things\u2019 goes down too. Yes, I\u2019m supposed to turn off my router and turn it on again, but if I\u2019m not at home, is there anything I can do when I\u2019m out of town? Any help? It\u2019s very frustrating!\"",
      "Tom, we understand your frustration. It can be inconvenient when your internet goes down, especially when you\u2019re not at home to reset your router. However, there are ways to reset your router remotely. Here are the general steps to resetting your router remotely using a web browser.",

      "How to reset your router remotely (the right way)",
      "Before we start, though, it's important to note that you will need administrator access to your router. Luckily, this is simple if it's your own home router. Unless you've changed the settings, your router uses the default username and password for its model, which you can find by a simple web search. However, leaving your router at default settings is a serious security risk. Make sure to change the default login and local IP address as soon as possible.",
      "If you're at home, you can use your local network IP (typically http://192.168.1.1) to log in to your router. This only works when your device is connected to the same Wi-Fi network. This is known as LAN (Local Area Network) access.",
      "If you're away from home (like at work or in a hotel), you won\u2019t be able to use 192.168.x.x to access your router. Instead, you\u2019d need to use your router\u2019s public IP address (also called WAN address). This requires setting up remote access in advance, usually by enabling remote management, Dynamic DNS or using a VPN. Be aware that this can open your network up to security vulnerabilities if not done carefully.",
      "Important: Allowing your router to be administered from the internet (WAN) is not recommended for most users due to the significant security risks. If you choose to do this, use strong, unique passwords, and consider VPN access instead.",
      "Use your ISP\u2019s app",
      "The safest and easiest method \u2014 if available \u2014 is to use your internet service provider\u2019s app. Most of the major ISPs in North America now allow you to reset your networking equipment remotely via a smartphone app, making it even easier to reset your router. This assumes you are using their router and not one you purchased for yourself. If you use a third-party router, you'll need to follow the steps above to reset it. Using an ISP app avoids opening your home network to the internet directly and usually includes built-in security protections.",

      "A smart plug lets you power cycle your router from anywhere by turning the plug off and on using a mobile app. This is a much safer option than enabling remote router access. It doesn't require exposing your router to the internet.",
      "Smart plugs come with smartphone apps that will allow you to set schedules and remotely turn and off and on plugs around your house, including the plug you plug your router into.",

For remote access, you'd need your router\u2019s public IP and advanced setup, which can be risky if not secured properly.

Nearly 100 earthquake victims were already waiting for surgery when the team arrived.",

      "Temperatures in the region are exceeding 110\u00b0F with high humidity. The team lives in tents and works in austere conditions. \"We provide our own accommodations. We have our own water, we have our electricity, we\u2019re self-contained, but it\u2019s a tough assignment,\" Graham said.",
      "Still, the team remains committed. \"They\u2019re holding clinics during the day, operating during the night\u2026 But our team is motivated. They are excited for the opportunity to serve the people of Myanmar and to do it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"",

      "The JCPOA has increasingly been considered a collapsed agreement after the U.S. withdrew in 2018 under the first Trump administration, followed by increasingly flagrant violations by Iran of the nuclear deal.",

But the U.S., which has been calling for snapbacks since 2018, was found by the U.N. and all JCPOA members to no longer be legally eligible to utilize the sanction mechanism after its withdrawal from the international agreement.",

      "A single veto is enough to block a resolution being enacted, and progress in the council has become stagnant following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "But even if Russia objects to reimposing sanctions on Iran, as Tehran has become a close ally of Moscow\u2019s, it actually has very few options for blocking the snapback mechanism that it previously agreed to, so long as at least one other nation actually calls for the sanction tool.",

Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.",

      "It\u2019s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.",

      "\u201cWhat I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,\u201d Bessent said.",

      "For Richard Painter, chief ethics lawyer for former President George W. Bush, who now teaches government ethics and security regulation at the University of Minnesota\u2019s law school, the morning posts, at a minimum, leave Trump open to questions about his intentions.",
      "\u201cThis is a scenario that could expose the president to accusations that he engaged in market manipulation,\u201d Painter said.",
      "Even before he\u2019d been sworn in for his second term, Trump faced insider-trading criticisms amid the launch of his $TRUMP meme coin. In that incident, the Trump Organization was explicit that a group of investors who were helping launch the coin stood to benefit from its release assuming its price went up. Still, reports showed other investors reaping outsized profits from the launch, including one crypto-wallet owner or owners who earned $109 million, according to a New York Times analysis.",
      "Some Democrats were quick to blast Trump\u2019s actions on Wednesday.",
      "Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told NBC News that the Trump administration is \u201creplete with grifters\u201d and that \u201ccorruption is its middle name.\u201d",
      "\u201cInsider trading is a real threat, and I hope there will be a surge of penetrating investigations into the potential for manipulation and insider trading of securities,\u201d Blumenthal said, \u201csince the knowledge of what Trump\u2019s plans have been and may be is widely spread.\u201d",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \u2014 a frequent object of Trump\u2019s scorn \u2014 also suggested an inquiry was warranted.",
      "\u201cTrump is creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs,\u201d Schiff wrote on social media. \u201cThese constant gyrations in policy provide dangerous opportunities for insider trading. Who in the administration knew about Trump\u2019s latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell\u00a0 stocks, and profit at the public\u2019s expense? I\u2019m writing to the White House \u2014 the public has a right to know.\u201d",
      "A White House spokesman rejected the Democrats\u2019 assertions.",
      "\u201cIt is the responsibility of the President of the United States to reassure the markets and Americans about their economic security in the face of nonstop media fearmongering,\u201d White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \u201cInstead of grasping at straws to try landing a punch on President Trump, Democrats should focus on working with the administration to restore American Greatness.\u201d",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment. The Securities and Exchange Commission did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Painter said the incident could result in investigations \u201cinto who knew what and when before [Trump] announced he was going to postpone the tariffs on all the countries except for China.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a terrible idea to make those posts,\u201d Painter said of Trump\u2019s suggestion that it was \u201ca great time to buy.\u201d",
      "Painter further admonished Trump, saying, \u201cI would hope that he would focus on doing his job\u00a0\u2014 and try to calm the markets and have a predictable trade policy and let the markets do their thing without the White House giving what appears to be investment advice.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton\u2019s attempt to topple Republican Sen. John Cornyn in a Senate primary next year kicks off one of the most intense contests of the 2026 elections \u2014 a GOP-versus-GOP battle between two men who have been sparring for years and vying for President Donald Trump\u2019s attention.",
      "Cornyn is a fixture of the Republican Party in Texas, serving in its highest offices for more than 30 years and becoming a key voice on Capitol Hill. Paxton, the third-term attorney general who survived a bipartisan impeachment last year in part thanks to support from Trump and conservative activist allies, believes there\u2019s an opening to cut the incumbent down from the right.",
      "Now, both sides are aligning themselves with Trump amid the possibility of an endorsement that could tip the primary.",
      "Whether one comes or not, one thing is clear. \u201cThis is gonna be the nastiest race in the modern era of Texas politics, period,\u201d former Travis County GOP chairman Matt Mackowiak said.",
      "Paxton immediately attacked Cornyn for having \u201cturned his back on President Trump,\u201d pointing to comments Cornyn made in 2023 about Trump\u2019s indictment over his handling of classified documents, as well as the senator\u2019s comments that he didn\u2019t think Trump \u201ccould win the presidency\u201d after Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil case that same year.",
      "Paxton has also targeted Cornyn over his votes on issues including guns and immigration to try to argue that he is more aligned with conservative values.",
      "\u201cWhile John was criticizing Trump and suggesting he shouldn\u2019t run, I was at Mar-a-Lago\u201d for Trump\u2019s presidential announcement speech, Paxton told \u201cThe Mark Davis Show\u201d in Dallas.",
      "\"If he had the record of [Texas GOP Sen.] Ted Cruz, would I be here? Absolutely not,\" Paxton continued. \"This isn\u2019t about what he\u2019s saying and the love he suddenly has for President Trump and the love he has for all of our issues now. This isn\u2019t about that love. I don\u2019t believe that love, I believe in action.\"",
      "Cornyn, though, also made an appeal to Trump\u2019s interests, telling reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday that Paxton\u2019s Senate bid is a \u201ccon man\u2019s vanity project.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe biggest potential loser is President Trump\u2019s agenda,\u201d Cornyn said of the primary challenge.",
      "\u201cMr. Paxton has a checkered background, he is a con man and a fraud, and I think the people of Texas know that, but this is what will be litigated during the course of this campaign. I am not going to turn over the Senate seat that was once held by Sam Houston to someone like him,\u201d he added, a reference to the 2023 impeachment trial of Paxton, after which he survived a conviction vote in the state Senate.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s unclear to me exactly what is motivating Mr. Paxton other than vanity and personal ambition,\u201d Cornyn continued.",
      "In the months before Paxton jumped in \u2014 and in the hours since \u2014 Cornyn has made clear he\u2019s hugging Trump as tight as he can. He posted on X a photo of him reading Trump\u2019s \u201cThe Art of the Deal\u201d and called it \u201crecommended\u201d reading; he took to the Senate floor to defend Trump aide and billionaire Elon Musk (whose businesses have a significant footprint in Texas) after protests at Tesla dealerships; and he has been framing himself as one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate.",
      "A long-simmering feud",
      "The roots of this clash between another establishment-insurgent pair of Republicans run deep, part of a decade-plus battle within the Texas GOP that has ousted legislative leaders, fueled Cruz's rise, fanned the flames of Paxton\u2019s impeachment, and led to proxy wars up and down the ballot.",
      "Paxton had been telegraphing a run against Cornyn from the right for more than a year. In early 2024, Paxton lambasted the senator as \u201canti-Trump [and] anti-gun\u201d in a post on X, adding that \u201cTexans deserve another conservative Senator.\u201d",
      "Cornyn reposted the message and replied: \u201cHard to run from prison, Ken,\u201d a reference to the investigations that led to the impeachment trial. (The Associated Press reported this month that the Justice Department decided last year not to prosecute Paxton over corruption allegations.)",
      "Brendan Steinhauser, a longtime GOP consultant who served as Cornyn\u2019s campaign manager in the past but is unaffiliated in this race, told NBC News it\u2019s no surprise to see Cornyn campaign with an eye on Trump.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re Senator Cornyn, you\u2019re going to be campaigning on all the ways that you have supported and worked with the president, you\u2019re going to talk about all the policies where you align, you\u2019re going to talk about helping to get all of his judicial nominees through,\u201d he said.",
      "While a potential endorsement from Trump remains a major question, Cornyn does have support from Senate Republicans. Sen. Tim Scott, of South Carolina, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, has made his case for Cornyn to White House officials.",
      "Scott also told Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, who has also been weighing a Senate run, that the NRSC is behind Cornyn, according to a source familiar with the discussions.",
      "\u201cJohn Cornyn is a leader who delivers on President Trump\u2019s agenda and for the people of Texas in the U.S. Senate,\u201d Scott said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cHe\u2019s a proven fighter, man of faith and essential part of the Republican Senate Majority.\u201d",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., has also been publicly backing Cornyn and recently told CNN he was hopeful Trump would back Cornyn in the race.",
      "Asked Wednesday if he has personally asked Trump to endorse Cornyn, Thune told reporters at the Capitol: \u201cWell, we\u2019re having conversations about all of the races on the map. When we have anything to report, we\u2019ll let you know.\u201d",
      "Senate Leadership Fund, the main GOP super PAC involved in Senate races, which is aligned with Republican leadership, indicated it is also in Cornyn's corner.",
      "\"Leader John Thune, NRSC Chairman Tim Scott, and many of their colleagues have expressed great admiration and support for Senator John Cornyn and his years of service to the people of Texas,\" SLF Chairman Cory Gardner, a former senator from Colorado, said in a statement to NBC News. \"The Senate Leadership Fund fully intends on seeing him reelected next November.\"",
      "Mackowiak, a longtime Texas political consultant, told NBC News that he sees Paxton\u2019s early announcement as an indication of two things: The attorney general sees an opening, but he knows he needs time to raise the money required to combat Cornyn and the power of incumbency.",
      "\u201cPaxton\u2019s never run a race this complicated, this expensive against someone as accomplished and serious as John Cornyn,\" he said. \"John Cornyn has never been challenged by someone that has the statewide profile and grassroots enthusiasm Paxton has.\"",
      "But Mackowiak argued that while Paxton has sought to go on offense early, that dynamic may not stick, and that the events that led to Paxton\u2019s impeachment trial (which divided Republicans in the state) will likely be relitigated.",
      "\u201cHe is going to be playing a lot more defense than he even understands. I think because he got through impeachment, these issues are behind him. They\u2019re not,\u201d he said.",
      "One potential wrinkle, particularly if Hunt or another Republican decides to jump in, is Texas\u2019 runoff rules. If no candidate wins the majority of the vote in the primary, the top two move on to a one-on-one runoff election.",
      "Cornyn has never lost an election in Texas, and he\u2019s never been forced to a runoff by any of his opponents (who have largely challenged him from the right). But the prospect of a split field leading to a runoff is another complicating factor, with both Mackowiak and Steinhauser noting that runoff electorates typically favor the candidate with more grassroots conservative support.",
      "Senate map",
      "The Texas race could have broader implications for the fight for the Senate next year as Republicans look to defend their slim majority.",
      "Democrats need to net three seats to take control of the Senate, but they face an uphill battle with a short list of targets. Just one Republican \u2014 Maine\u2019s Susan Collins \u2014 is running in a state that former Vice President Kamala Harris carried in November. Republicans, meanwhile, are looking to grow their majority by targeting Democratic-held seats in battleground states.",
      "But Cornyn said\u00a0a competitive election in Texas could put a strain on Republicans nationally by diverting money away from other key battlegrounds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to end up spending hundreds of millions of dollars, potentially, on this race in Texas, because we can\u2019t lose the seat in Texas,\u201d said Cornyn, a former NRSC chairman. \u201cAnd that is money that can\u2019t be used in places like Michigan, New Hampshire and Georgia in the midterm elections.\u201d",
      "Democrats have long coveted the idea of flipping Texas, with former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke coming close to defeating Cruz in the blue wave year of 2018. But Trump expanded his margin last year in Texas compared to 2020, carrying Texas by 14 percentage points as Cruz defeated former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred by 9 points.",
      "Allred told The Dallas Morning News last month that he is \u201cseriously considering\u201d another run for Senate against Cornyn. Cruz, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday that he is staying neutral in this year\u2019s Senate primary, saying both Paxton and Cornyn are friends.",
      "\u201cI have worked closely with both of them. I respect them both,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cAnd I trust the voters of Texas to make that decision.\u201d",
      "A divisive GOP primary could play into Democrats\u2019 hands \u2014 especially if Paxton is the nominee. In the meantime, Democrats are watching the GOP primary process play out in Texas and other states. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesperson Maeve Coyle noted that former New Hampshire GOP Gov. Chris Sununu announced Tuesday that he would not be running for that state\u2019s open Senate seat.",
      "\u201cAs Republicans face a nasty primary in Texas and an embarrassing recruitment failure in New Hampshire \u2014 coupled with a building midterm backlash across the map driven by their threats to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and their push to spike costs for families \u2014 Democrats will look for every opportunity to put them on defense,\u201d Coyle said."

    "story": [
      "Gretchen Whitmer became governor after promising to \u201cfix the damn roads\u201d in Michigan.",
      "Whether she goes any further depends on how well she can navigate some of the early bumps surfacing as she positions herself for a possible White House bid.",
      "On Wednesday, during a trip to Washington, D.C., that put a spotlight on her prospects in 2028, Whitmer hit what many of her fellow Democrats saw as two sizable potholes.",
      "First, in a policy speech outlining a \u201cconsistent national strategy,\u201d Whitmer staked out common ground with President Donald Trump. And though Whitmer criticized Trump\u2019s sweeping, roller-coaster rollout of \u2014 and subsequent retreat from \u2014 tariffs, she said she was not against tariffs \u201coutright\u201d and expressed understanding of Trump\u2019s \u201cmotivation\u201d behind deploying them. That drew a social media rebuke from Colorado\u2019s Democratic governor, Jared Polis.",
      "\u201cTariffs are bad outright because they lead to higher prices and destroy American manufacturing,\u201d Polis, another potential 2028 contender who has also sought ways to find common cause with Trump, wrote on X. \u201cTrade is inherently good because both parties emerge better off from a consensual transaction.\u201d",
      "Then, later Wednesday, Whitmer joined Trump in the Oval Office. She was scheduled to meet privately with him and discuss Michigan issues. That wasn\u2019t how it ultimately played out.",
      "Instead, she stood by as he signed several executive orders, including two calling for Justice Department probes of officials who served in his first administration and called him out for falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen. He made the false claims about the election\u2019s being \u201crigged\u201d again Wednesday.",
      "Whitmer was invited into the Oval Office alongside Michigan state House Speaker Matt Hall, a Republican, as Trump held court with reporters and signed the executive orders. Photos showed Whitmer standing uncomfortably against a door as the cameras rolled.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really done an excellent job,\u201d Trump said of Whitmer during the impromptu media availability. \u201cVery good person.\u201d",
      "Though Trump did engage with her on issues she came to discuss, the fact that she was present at what amounted to a bipartisan photo opportunity as he took actions targeting political critics angered and confused allies.",
      "\u201cJust a f---ing disaster,\u201d said a Democratic operative who admires Whitmer and, like others interviewed for this article, was granted anonymity to share candid thoughts about her day. \u201cIt feels like it removes some of the momentum she had as a politically savvy swing-state Dem.\u201d",
      "Whitmer\u2019s team moved quickly to contain the fallout and counter mounting criticism from within her party.",
      "\u201cThe governor was surprised that she was brought into the Oval Office\" during President Trump\u2019s press conference without any notice of the subject matter,\u201d a Whitmer spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cHer presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.\u201d",
      "Democrats have long seen Whitmer as one of the party\u2019s more formidable figures \u2014\u00a0a two-term governor of a battleground state who won re-election in a landslide and was nearly tapped to be Joe Biden\u2019s running mate in 2020 after having considerably raised her public profile during the Covid pandemic. Whitmer is among a handful of prominent Democratic governors viewed as potential presidential contenders in 2028.",
      "But unlike some of her contemporaries, Whitmer has chosen to seek out a stronger working relationship with Trump in his second term. Trump won her state last fall, and Whitmer views herself as more of a center-left moderate with a middle-of-the-road, Midwestern constituency \u2014\u00a0one that is receptive to Trump\u2019s message, including and especially on manufacturing and tariff policy.",
      "In her Washington speech Wednesday, Whitmer called for cutting red tape and building more in the United States. She also railed against \u201cpartisanship,\u201d saying it has seemingly \u201cinfected every aspect of our lives, and it\u2019s exhausting.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s give more hard-working people a fair shot at a decent life,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd let\u2019s usher in, as President Trump says, a \u2018Golden Age\u2019 of American manufacturing.\u201d",
      "She did break with Trump on the more substantial tariffs he announced last week\u00a0and partially paused later Wednesday afternoon,\u00a0describing them as a \u201ctriple whammy: higher costs, fewer jobs and more uncertainty.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand the motivation behind the tariffs, and I can tell you here\u2019s where President Trump and I do agree,\u201d she said. \u201cWe do need to make more stuff in America \u2014 more cars and chips, more steel and ships. We do need fair trade.\u201d",
      "Her stance on tariffs puts her at odds with other potential Democratic presidential hopefuls, like Polis and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who offered sharp criticism of Trump\u2019s \u201cwrongheaded\u201d measures in a speech in his state Wednesday.",
      "During a question-and-answer session with journalist Gretchen Carlson after her speech, Whitmer empathized with the many Democrats who don\u2019t want Democratic officials to work with Trump. But she said she needs to be collaborative because \u201cI took an oath to the people of Michigan to try to get as much done for the state.\u201d",
      "Whitmer also said she hadn\u2019t \u201cthought through\u201d how she\u2019d handle tariffs differently from Trump, only that they should be used as a \u201cscalpel.\u201d",
      "A national Democratic strategist said, \u201cIt is a massive indictment on Whitmer and her team\u2019s judgment to, first, not have an answer on the tariff question and then go the White House and get absolutely played by Donald Trump to the point she is caught in the Oval Office as he signs one of his revenge and retribution executive orders and says 2020 was rigged.\u201d",
      "About tariffs, her spokesperson emphasized areas of disagreement with Trump rather than ways the two overlap on the policy.",
      "\u201cThis morning, the governor delivered a speech in Washington, D.C., about the devastating effects tariffs were having on Michiganders \u2014 from companies increasing prices and laying off workers to retirement accounts being wiped out,\u201d Whitmer\u2019s spokesperson said. \u201cThis afternoon, the 90-day pause was announced, and that is a step in the right direction and will provide relief to so many businesses across the state, but we remain concerned about tariffs that will hurt American auto companies.\u201d",
      "Whitmer and Hall were supposed to discuss with Trump federal investment at Michigan\u2019s Selfridge Air National Guard Base, a recent devastating ice storm in the state and a plan to deal with invasive Asian carp in Lake Michigan. Whitmer\u2019s team and her allies described the meeting as a success on those matters.",
      "\u201cGovernor Whitmer thanks President Trump for his acknowledgements on protecting the Great Lakes from invasive carp, his work on Selfridge, and his openness to our request for help in northern Michigan,\u201d her spokesperson said.",
      "A Democratic official who used to work with Whitmer said her dealings with Trump show she \u201cis very good at advocating for her state.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd President Trump clearly listens to what she says and what she does,\u201d this person said. \u201cYou saw that today on tariffs, on the progress they made on Selfridge and on the other issues she brought to discuss.\u201d",
      "Whitmer\u2019s day also offered some political nuance. Her visit to the Oval Office didn\u2019t annoy just Democrats. Republicans complained that it was an unnecessary boost to a leader they have long tried to demonize in a crucial electoral battleground.",
      "\u201cTrump literally just f---ed Republicans in Michigan by saying Whitmer is doing an excellent job,\u201d a Republican strategist from Michigan wrote in a text message. \u201cI mean, WTF, she is running to replace him in 2028.\u201d",
      "The budding Trump-Whitmer relationship \u2014 Wednesday\u2019s meeting was their second in less than two months \u2014 would have been unthinkable not so long ago. Trump figured prominently in the political memoir Whitmer published last year, with a long-standing feud between them accounting for a large share of the first chapter: \u201cDon\u2019t Let the Bullies Get You Down.\u201d",
      "Whitmer wrote about how Trump responded to her criticism of his leadership during the early days of the pandemic by branding her dismissively and derisively as \u201cthat woman from Michigan.\u201d Whitmer and her team embraced the insulting sobriquet, which became a staple in progressive merchandising.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the secret to dealing with bullies: You take their weapon and make it your shield,\u201d Whitmer wrote. \u201cEvery time Trump gave me a nickname, I made it my own.\u201d",
      "That history had some observers struggling with cognitive dissonance Wednesday.",
      "\u201cWhitmer hurt her candidacy today,\u201d a Democratic strategist said. \u201cShe looked and sounded nervous in the Oval Office. That visual will stick. So will the image of Trump praising her as he signed executive orders targeting his critics.\u201d",
      "A second Democratic operative who has worked with Whitmer previously said her speech today felt like an \u201copening salvo\u201d for a presidential bid.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s sort of this absolutism among Democrats where you\u2019re either all against him or you\u2019re not against him enough, right?\u201d this person said. \u201cAnd I think if you are a Midwestern governor, there are certainly appropriate times to be for tariffs.\u201d",
      "This person was surprised at the pushback she got from Polis after her address, adding that criticism showed \u201c2028 is on.\u201d But the person was also perplexed by Whitmer\u2019s Oval Office appearance.",
      "\u201cIt overall seemed not great,\u201d this person said. \u201cThe photo of her standing there in the corner looking uncomfortable. The odd banter. The whole thing didn\u2019t make a lot of sense. Why did it happen? Whose idea was that?\u201d",
      "Still, this person said Whitmer, who has pledged to work across the aisle, including with Trump, to deliver results for her state, can point to tangible results from her trip to Michiganders.",
      "But nationally, the conversation around her visit will be very different.",
      "\u201cOverall, hey, great visit, right?\u201d this person continued, rattling off the local issues Whitmer went to discuss \u2014 before pivoting to the executive order spectacle. \u201cIt felt like, holy s---, what just happened?\u201d"

    "published": "Thu, 10 Apr 2025 01:29:25 GMT",
    "summary": "Trump and officials in his administration were fielding calls from worried allies, and his advisers presented him with worrying data on the bond markets.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day\u201d just gave way to Capitulation Day.",
      "President Donald Trump pulled back Wednesday on a series of harsh tariffs targeting friends and foes alike in an audacious bid to remake the global economic order.",
      "Trump's early afternoon announcement followed a harrowing week in which Republican lawmakers and confidants privately warned him that the tariffs could wreck the economy. His own aides had quietly raised alarms about the financial markets before he suspended a tariff regime that he had unveiled with a flourish just one week earlier in a Rose Garden ceremony.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "The stock market rose immediately after the about-face, ending days of losses that have forced older Americans who've been sinking their savings into 401(k)s to rethink their retirement plans.",
      "Ahead of Trump's announcement, some of his advisers had been in a near panic about the bond markets, according to a senior administration official. Interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds had been rising, contrary to what normally happens when stock prices fall and investors seek safety in treasuries. The unusual dynamic meant that at the same time the tariffs could push up prices, people would be paying more to buy homes or pay off credit card debt because of higher interest rates. Businesses looking to expand would pay more for new loans.",
      "Two of Trump's most senior advisers, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented a united front Wednesday, urging him to suspend the tariffs in light of the bond market, the administration official said.",
      "In a social media post, Trump announced a 90-day pause that he said he\u2019ll use to negotiate deals with dozens of countries that have expressed openness to revising trade terms that he contends exploit American businesses and workers. One exception is China. Trump upped the tariff on the country\u2019s biggest geopolitical rival to 125%, part of a tit-for-tat escalation in an evolving trade war.",
      "Trump reversed course one week after he appeared in the Rose Garden and unveiled his plan to bring jobs back to the United States. Displaying a chart showing the new, elevated tariffs that countries would face, Trump proclaimed, \u201cMy fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day.\u201d",
      "It proved short-lived.",
      "Markets plunged in anticipation of heightened trade wars, wiping out trillions of dollars in wealth. Democrats seized on the issue, looking to undercut a source of Trump\u2019s popular appeal: the view that he can be trusted to steer the nation\u2019s economy.",
      "\u201cDonald Trump\u2019s market crash has vaporized a whopping $104,000 from the average retirement account,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Wednesday on the Senate floor, hours before Trump\u2019s reversal.",
      "The episode laid bare the rifts within Trump\u2019s team of senior advisers as the White House struggled to offer a clear, consistent argument about the duration of the tariffs. While Bessent seemed open to negotiations, Peter Navarro, a senior trade adviser, appeared to take a more hard-line posture.",
      "Elon Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO who has been advising Trump on the government workforce, called Navarro \u201cdumber than a sack of bricks,\u201d while Navarro described Musk as someone who is merely \u201ca car assembler, in many cases.\u201d",
      "But the weeklong drama also underscored the peril of a policymaking process that is often tied to the wishes and vagaries of one man: Trump.",
      "Asked about the dust-up between Musk and Navarro, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a golf partner of Trump\u2019s, said: \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters. The only one who matters is Trump.\u201d",
      "Markets tend to favor predictability, as do business leaders deciding where to build new plants. When Trump sets a course, however, there are bound to be detours.",
      "A friend of his who spoke to him in recent days said Trump gave no sign he was about to \u201cback down quickly on this stuff.\u201d",
      "Trump believes other countries trade unfairly and sees tariffs as a tool to make the United States more competitive, the person said.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s very confident it\u2019s going to work for him,\u201d the person added, speaking on condition of anonymity.",
      "And yet in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s announcement, Trump and his aides were also hearing from GOP lawmakers and outside allies urging an alternative path.",
      "One was Larry Kudlow, who hosts a show on Fox Business Network and was a senior economic adviser in Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Kudlow told NBC News that he has had \u201congoing\u201d talks with friends in the West Wing about the need to negotiate with other countries before the United States slaps them with tariffs that stand in perpetuity.",
      "Describing Trump\u2019s move Wednesday as \u201cfabulous,\u201d Kudlow added: \u201cDealmaking is the best thing to do. In the last 48 hours, Trump has gone from non-negotiating to negotiating. It\u2019s very clear that Bessent is now the point man on trade. Very clear.\u201d",
      "Anxious GOP lawmakers also weighed in.",
      "Graham said he spoke to Trump at length Tuesday night and told him he has been hearing from car manufacturers who are worried about how the tariffs would affect their business. BMW operates a plant in Graham\u2019s home state and is one of the companies he said he has spoken to.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., a lawmaker who was also in touch with the administration, said Tuesday that he planned to have lunch with Bessent. On Wednesday, he told NBC News he was also talking to the White House. Kennedy likened Trump to the \u201cpit bull who caught the car.\u201d Now, he said, the question becomes: \u201cWhat are you going to\u00a0do with the car?\u201d",
      "After more market losses this week, and with pressure mounting from Republicans on Capitol Hill, Trump began having second thoughts. In his first term, he often viewed the ups and downs of the stock market as a kind of report card on his presidency, celebrating its rise. The downturn had gotten his attention.",
      "\u201cPeople were getting a little queasy,\u201d he acknowledged Wednesday at an event with NASCAR racing champions.",
      "\"Over the last few days,\" he began to more seriously consider pausing the additional tariffs, he told reporters later in the day in an Oval Office appearance. One prospect that intrigued him was personally negotiating new trade deals with the countries looking to get out from under the tariffs, the senior administration official said.",
      "He'd made up his mind. Sitting with Bessent and Lutnick, he crafted the note announcing the 90-day postponement and ending, for the time being, the biggest economic crisis of his young presidency.",
      "\u201cWe wrote it from our hearts, right?\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was written as something that I think was very positive for the world and for us, and we don\u2019t want to hurt countries that don\u2019t need to be hurt, and they all want to negotiate.\u201d",
      "The day closed with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up nearly 8%, erasing some \u2014 but not all \u2014 of the post-\u201cLiberation Day\u201d losses.",
      "Messy as it all may have seemed, his administration insisted that all is unfolding as planned.",
      "\"You have been watching the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,\" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller posted Wednesday afternoon."

      "Then came the tribute,\u00a0a video of Doncic\u2019s time\u00a0with the Mavericks after the rest of the Lakers starting lineup had been introduced Wednesday night before his first game back in Dallas.",
      "That left Doncic alone on the bench for more than two minutes looking up to some of his many highlights in Dallas \u2014 from his NBA rookie of the year season into last year\u2019s NBA Finals \u2014 though he didn\u2019t make it all the way through before\u00a0putting his head down\u00a0and wiping away tears. His eyes were still red once he was introduced and came on the court with his teammates who surrounded him, including several hugs.",
      "Everyone knew it was going to be an emotional night with Doncic wearing his No. 77 jersey for the Lakers. It was for both the 26-year-old from Slovenia and those Mavericks fans who were there when he wore that number in Mavericks blue the first 5 1/2 seasons of his career.",
      "Right after tipoff, the chant \u201cFire Nico\u201d broke out, directed toward Nico Harrison, the Mavericks general manager who traded Doncic. That chant got louder and longer in the first quarter, when Doncic already had 14 points on 5-of-9 shooting.",
      "\u201cThat first time back is always emotional and there\u2019s no predicting how you\u2019re going to feel,\u201d Lakers coach JJ Redick said before the game. \u201cWhether you sit and think about it for days like Dallas has or whether it\u2019s a back-to-back, the emotions and the feelings are still going to be there.\u201d",
      "By the end of the game, Doncic had tallied 45 points, 8 rebounds and 6 assists in the Lakers' 112-97 victory. As he was subbed off with 1:34 left in the 4th quarter, fans in the arena clapped and cheered him.",
      "Not long after, more \"Fire Nico\" chants erupted.",
      "Doncic\u2019s return came two months after that\u00a0seismic trade\u00a0out of nowhere. He had been the\u00a0face of the Mavericks, and he was the NBA scoring champion last season when they made it to the NBA Finals. The 2019 rookie of the year had two seasons left on his contract before the trade the first weekend of February in a package that brought Anthony Davis to Dallas.",
      "\u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t know about closure. It\u2019s obviously a lot,\u201d Doncic said after a loss at Oklahoma City on Tuesday night. \u201cI know the fans are going to appreciate me being back here. Honestly, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel, but I\u2019m just excited to be back.\u201d",
      "Not long before the sold-out game, tickets on the secondary market for upper-level seats were still listed for more than $200, excluding fees. For the Mavericks final home game Friday night against Toronto, similar tickets were available for less than $20 before fees.",
      "Mavericks fans conducted a mock funeral outside the American Airlines Center on Feb. 2, right after news of the trade late the previous night. There have been protests and plenty of ire directed at Harrison, including \u201cFire Nico!\u201d showing up on plenty of signs and T-shirts. As for the GM, he hasn\u2019t spoken to the media since comments he made right after the deal was done when he said he felt the team was \u201cbuilt to win now as well as in the future.\u201d",
      "While there were no organized protests outside the arena before the game, plenty of people wore No. 77 jerseys \u2014 both the purple and gold ones of the Lakers and Mavericks jerseys as well, though some of those home ones had the Dallas logo covered up. There were even some Slovenia jerseys.",
      "One fan sitting a couple of rows behind the Dallas bench had a Mavericks No. 77 jersey, but had \u201cLakers\u201d written on duct tape covering up the logo. A fan outside wore a Los Angeles jersey with duct tape covering the Lakers logo that read \u201cFormer Mavs fan.\u201d",
      "This isn\u2019t the first time Doncic played the Mavericks. He\u00a0had a triple double\u00a0(19 points, 15 rebounds and 12 assists) in the Lakers\u2019 107-99 home win on Feb. 25, only 23 days after the trade.",
      "After that game, Doncic struggled for the words to express how strange it was to play against the Mavs.",
      "\u201cIt was so weird,\u201d Doncic said then. \u201cThere were moments I felt like I don\u2019t know what I was doing.\u201d"

      "A judge has dismissed conspiracy and kidnapping charges against five Massachusetts college students who were accused of plotting to lure a man to their campus through a dating app and then seizing him as part of a trend on social media.",
      "The Assumption University students, all teenagers, were\u00a0arraigned in January\u00a0and entered not guilty pleas. Since then, their lawyers had filed motions seeking to dismiss the charges, saying authorities lacked probable cause to believe they committed crimes.",
      "Following a hearing last month, a Worcester District Court judge on Tuesday dismissed the conspiracy and kidnapping charges against Kelsy Brainard, Easton Randall, Kevin Carroll, Isabella Trudeau and Joaquin Smith. It wasn\u2019t immediately known if charges were still pending against a sixth student, whose case was being handled in juvenile court.",
      "One of the students who was charged had told police that the trend  was modeled on \u201cTo Catch a Predator,\u201d NBC\u2019s\u00a0discontinued program\u00a0that, during its three seasons, aimed to catch adults seeking to prey on minors using undercover cameras and decoys impersonating underage dates,\u00a0according to a statement of facts in the case.",
      "Police say Brainard\u2019s Tinder account was used to lure the man to the private, Roman Catholic university in Worcester last October and that the encounter was caught on video.",
      "Brainard still faces a charge of witness intimidation and Carroll faces a charge of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon.",
      "\u201cWe are grateful that the court, after a fair hearing and due consideration, applied the law properly,\u201d Brainard\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Todd, said in an email Wednesday. \u201cNo decisions have been made about our path to resolution of the remaining count.\u201d",
      "A message seeking comment was emailed Wednesday to Carroll\u2019s lawyer.",
      "The Assumption University Police Department \u201cfulfilled its duty as an accredited law enforcement agency by filing charges describing the facts of the incident and the elements of a crime under Massachusetts law,\u201d university spokesperson Matt McDermott said in an email Wednesday. \u201cThe district attorney accepted and prosecuted those charges. All of the charges in the case, including those that remain in place, are within the purview of the judicial system to resolve.\u201d",
      "The district attorney office\u2019s rules of professional conduct preclude it from commenting, \u201cas there are still pending cases in this matter,\u201d spokesperson Lindsay Corcoran said in an email.",
      "A report filed by campus police said a 22-year-old active-duty military service member connected with a woman on Tinder in October and was invited inside a basement lounge. Within minutes, \u201ca group of people came out of nowhere and started calling him a pedophile,\u201d accusing him of wanting sex with 17-year-old girls, according to the report.",
      "The man told police that he broke free and was chased by at least 25 people to his car, where he was punched in the head and his car door was slammed on him before he managed to flee.",
      "Campus surveillance video shows a large group of students, including the woman, \u201call with their cellphones out in what seems to be a recording of the whole episode,\u201d the police statement said. They are seen \u201claughing and high fiving with each other\u201d in what appeared to be \u201ca deliberately staged event,\u201d and there was no evidence to indicate the man was seeking sexual relations with girls, the police report said.",
      "Todd\u2019s motion to dismiss said the video does not show anyone making an active effort to restrain the man and that Brainard stays on the couch in the lounge after he leaves. He said it was insufficient evidence to show \u201cthat she was willing to assist in this \u2018kidnapping.\u2019\u201d Todd also said there was no evidence of a plan to hold the man against his will.",
      "Todd said a review of the conversation on the Tinder app shows the woman says she is 17, soon to turn 18. The man says \u201cthat\u2019s fine, you\u2019re in college.\u201d",
      "\"To Catch a Predator,\" which aired from 2004 to 2007, used hidden cameras and people posing as minors in online chat rooms to lure alleged predators to houses where the host would confront them. The program did not condone or include any violence."

      "In a brief interview, Issa argued that both parties would benefit from the legislation. He said that during President Joe Biden's administration, Democrats howled when conservative judges issued nationwide injunctions against his executive actions.",
      "\"This is a growing problem that has vexed both Republican and Democrat presidents,\" Issa, a senior member of the Judiciary Committee and the former chairman of the Oversight Committee, said before the vote. Biden, \"to the very end, was trying to get this process of activist judges exceeding their jurisdiction rolled back.\"",
      "This bill, Issa said, \"limits judges to the original intent, which will allow them to make decisions but only as to the plaintiffs.\"",
      "Trump and his allies have grown frustrated with lower-court judges\u2019 issuing injunctions blocking Trump\u2019s actions on deportations of undocumented immigrants, sweeping cuts and mass firings at federal agencies, ending birthright citizenship and other matters.",
      "Much of Republicans' criticism has centered on U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who halted Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants alleged to be Tren de Aragua gang members.",
      "After that decision, Rep. Brandon Gill, R-Texas, a Trump ally, introduced a resolution to impeach Boasberg, who is based in Washington, D.C. Other judges who have ruled against Trump also have faced impeachment threats, including U.S. District Judges Paul A. Engelmayer and John Bates.",
      "But GOP leaders have acknowledged such impeachment resolutions wouldn't have enough support to pass out of the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 220-213 majority.",
      "On top of that, 67 votes would be needed for convictions in the Senate, where Republicans have a 53-47 majority.",
      "In some high-profile cases, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court has been ruling in Trump\u2019s favor. On Monday, it tossed out Boasberg\u2019s decision blocking the removal of the alleged gang members to El Salvador.",
      "A day later, the Supreme Court halted a ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup of California requiring some federal agencies to reinstate roughly 16,000 workers the Trump administration had tried to fire.",
      "Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, said his party in the past has tried to block \"judicial forum shopping,\" in which plaintiffs try to pick courts where they have higher chances of winning.",
      "\"But a nationwide injunction is a necessary part of the judicial tool kit,\" said Raskin, a former constitutional law professor. \"Why should every person affected [by an issue] have to go to court? Why should millions of people have to create their own case?\"",
      "\"Why should Brown vs. Board of Education have applied to just Linda Brown as opposed to everybody affected?\" he added."

    "summary": "The task force is looking for grounds to revoke visas of foreign students studying in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "A recently created Department of Homeland Security task force is using data analytic tools to scour the social media histories of the estimated 1.5 million foreign students studying in the United States for potential grounds to revoke their visas, three sources familiar with the operation told NBC News. They said records are also being searched for charges or criminal convictions of the student visa holders.",
      "DHS officials also announced Wednesday that the department would begin considering what it deems to be antisemitic activity on social media and \u201cphysical harassment of Jewish individuals\u201d as grounds to revoke or deny immigration benefits.",
      "\u201cThis will immediately affect aliens applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and aliens affiliated with educational institutions linked to antisemitic activity,\u201d the announcement said.",
      "The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim civil rights and advocacy organization, said the new policy was a return to \u201cMcCarthyism,\u201d referring to the tactics used to identify alleged communists in the Cold War that violated privacy rights.",
      "\u201cThe spirit of Joseph McCarthy is alive and well in the Trump administration, which has spent months dishonestly mischaracterizing legitimate criticism of the Israeli government\u2019s war crimes in Gaza as antisemitic, pursuing witch hunts into American colleges, and threatening the free speech rights of immigrants,\u201d CAIR National Deputy Director Edward Ahmed Mitchell said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "The data analytic tools now being used to scour social media were enhanced during the Biden administration, a former Biden administration DHS official said. But to use them to search social media of nonviolent students, the official said, is different from what the previous administration intended.",
      "\u201cWe were not targeting political activity or speech. We would only review them if they were inciting violence,\u201d the former Biden administration official said.",
      "The tools the DHS task force is using are run by Customs and Border Protection\u2019s National Targeting Center and National Vetting Center, both of which are typically tasked with using software and data to keep potential security threats from entering the United States. Any potential red flags about a student are shared with Citizenship and Immigration Services, which in turn asks the State Department to make a determination about whether the student\u2019s visa should be revoked.",
      "If the State Department decides it should be revoked, the task force informs Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in local field offices to arrest and deport the student, the sources said.",
      "Before the task force was created, much of the investigative work would have been done at the field office level and shared with local ICE officers, the sources said. Now, according to the sources, agents are taking orders from people they may not know from the task force in Washington about whom to arrest without clear guidance about why they are being targeted.",
      "Over the last month, nearly 300 international students have been stripped of their visas, according to media reports and universities that have reviewed their systems.",
      "ICE, which is part of DHS, runs the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which oversees foreign students on visas to study at U.S. academic institutions.",
      "ICE's critic",
      "ICE Chief of Staff Jon Feere had been a vocal critic of the Student and Exchange Visitor Program before he joined the Trump administration this year.",
      "Feere wrote dozens of articles for the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that advocates for reduced immigration into the United States, many of which pointed to cases of fraud he alleged was rampant in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program.",
      "\u201cBlatant, widespread fraud has become a central part of America\u2019s foreign student program, and the government agencies responsible for putting an end to it have been asleep at the wheel for far too long,\u201d Feere said in an article he published with the Center for Immigration Studies in August.",
      "DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement: \u201cThere is no room in the United States for the rest of the world\u2019s terrorist sympathizers, and we are under no obligation to admit them or let them stay here. Secretary [Kristi] Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism \u2014 think again.

      "Why are the talks so critical? Trump warned Monday that \u201cit\u2019s getting to be very dangerous territory, and hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran\u2019s best interests if they are successful.\u201d Last month, he was more explicit, telling \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Kristen Welker, \u201cIf they don\u2019t make a deal, there will be bombing, and it will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\u201d",
      "Multiple U.S. officials told NBC News that Iran is vulnerable to an attack: Israel\u2019s retaliatory strike against Iran last fall eliminated many of Tehran\u2019s air defenses. Israel has also killed the leader of Hezbollah, Iran\u2019s proxy and front line of defense in neighboring Lebanon. Hamas\u2019 leaders in Gaza, also Iran\u2019s proxies, are gone. So is Tehran\u2019s powerful ally in Syria, Bashar al-Assad. Trump has repeatedly signaled that he doesn\u2019t want a war with Iran. To avoid one, the two sides have to at least agree, finally, to come face to face.",

    "summary": "A transgender military pilot filed a defamation lawsuit against a conservative influencer who falsely connected her to the Potomac River plane crash in January.",
    "story": [
      "A transgender military pilot filed a defamation lawsuit Wednesday against a conservative influencer who falsely claimed on social media that she was flying the helicopter that collided with a commercial jet near Reagan National Airport in January, killing 67 people.",
      "\u201cI want to hold this person accountable for what they did to me,\u201d Jo Ellis, a pilot who has served more than 15 years in the Virginia Army National Guard, said in a statement to NBC News. \u201cIt\u2019s become too common that people can say horrible things about someone, profit at their expense, and get away with it.\u201d",
      "On Jan. 30, less than 24 hours after the crash, conservative influencer Matt Wallace, who has 2.2 million followers on the social media platform X, shared a post from another account he operates stating that the helicopter pilot was transgender, according to the lawsuit. Wallace included a photo of Ellis, and the post went viral, the lawsuit states.",
      "Wallace deleted that original post, according to the lawsuit, and then shared two others linking Ellis to the crash. One referred to an interview that Ellis did with The Smerconish Podcast, in which she said President Donald Trump\u2019s executive order barring trans people from serving and enlisting in the military made her nervous.",
      "The second post included photos of Ellis and said she might have participated in \u201canother trans terror attack,\u201d according to the lawsuit. That post received 4.8 million views on X, the suit states.",
      "Wallace did not immediately return a request for comment regarding the allegations in the lawsuit.",
      "On Jan. 31, after Ellis learned about the rumors, she shared a \u201cproof of life\u201d video on Facebook.",
      "\u201cI understand some people have associated me with the crash in D.C., and that is false,\u201d Ellis said in the Facebook video. \u201cIt is insulting to the families to try to tie this to some sort of political agenda. They don\u2019t deserve that. I don\u2019t deserve this. And I hope that you all know that I am alive and well, and this should be sufficient for you all to end all the rumors.\u201d",
      "Soon after Ellis\u2019 statement on Facebook, Wallace shared another X user\u2019s post with Ellis\u2019 video, writing that it was an \u201cImportant Update!\u201d and adding that Ellis was not piloting the helicopter and is still alive. Wallace also wrote in another X post that the original rumor that Ellis had been flying the helicopter involved in the crash came from another account with the handle @FakeGayPolitics, which is no longer active. Wallace said the rumor \u201cseemed credible\u201d because Ellis, whom Wallace misgendered in his posts, \u201cwrote an article calling out Trump\u2019s trans military ban only a few days ago.\u201d",
      "Ellis was not involved in the midair collision, the lawsuit states, did not write an article \u201ccalling out\u201d Trump\u2019s trans military ban and did not engage in \u201canother trans terror attack.\u201d",
      "Equality Legal Action Fund, an LGBTQ legal organization representing Ellis, argues in the complaint that Wallace \u201cconcocted a destructive and irresponsible defamation campaign\u201d against Ellis.",
      "\u201cThe damage caused to Plaintiff by Defendant was instantaneous and immense,\u201d the lawsuit continues. \u201cPrior to Defendant\u2019s campaign, Plaintiff was a private citizen who led a private life away from social media and the limelight. When Plaintiff awoke on January 31, 2025, she discovered she was the second most-trending topic in the United States on X with more than 90,000 posts mentioning her name or her likeness. Plaintiff was forced into the public sphere and can no longer remain a private citizen due to Defendant\u2019s lies.\u201d",
      "Ellis said her life was \u201cturned upside down\u201d by Wallace\u2019s posts.",
      "\u201cI feared for the safety of my family and myself and had to arrange private armed security,\u201d she said in her statement to NBC News. \u201cI\u2019m now recognized in public and forever associated with that terrible tragedy over the Potomac. When I go out in public I have to look over my shoulder now.\u201d",
      "Ellis\u2019 suit seeks damages for the injury to her reputation, though Ellis said she plans to donate any money that she wins from the suit to the families of the people who died in the crash.",
      "Trans people have increasingly been falsely blamed for tragedies and violence in recent years, particularly after mass shootings. Since 2022, false or unconfirmed claims have linked trans people to mass shootings in Uvalde, Texas; Nashville, Tennessee; Philadelphia; Madison, Wisconsin; and Des Moines, Iowa.",
      "In addition, since January, the Trump administration has enacted several policies targeting trans people, including the trans military ban, which states that being openly trans \u201cis not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\u201d Two judges have temporarily blocked that policy from taking effect."

      "In case you aren\u2019t familiar, \u201cPop the Balloon or Find Love\u201d became a viral hit in December 2023 when co-creator Arlette Amuli posted the first video of the dating series to her YouTube account. The episode introduced viewers to a single man looking for love and multiple contestants. If the contestants were attracted to the suitor and were intrigued by what he had to say, they would continue to get to know him. But, if they weren\u2019t interested, they would instantly (and loudly) pop their red balloon and explain why it wasn\u2019t a perfect match.",
      "Since then, Amuli has uploaded 50 episodes of the digital series, featuring both men and women as leads. Each video has accumulated over 1 million views as fans can\u2019t get enough of the uncomfortable interactions, and react to the contestants\u2019 decisions in the comments.",

    "summary": "Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Chris Meloni) reunite on screen for the first time in two years in \"Law & Order: Organized Crime\" Season Five.",
    "story": [
      "With chemistry as electrifying as Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni\u2019s, one would think they would cross over to each other\u2019s respective shows frequently. So, why haven\u2019t their beloved \u201cLaw & Order\u201d characters, Capt. Olivia Benson and Detective Elliot Stabler, physically been in a scene together in nearly two years?",
      "Benson and Stabler started out together on \u201cLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\u201d as detectives who were paired up to solve some of New York City\u2019s most heinous sex crimes when the NBC prime-time drama debuted in 1999. Stabler had a wife and multiple kids, and Benson stayed (mostly) single, but the two cultivated a large and very loyal fan base who hoped their partnership would take a romantic turn.",
      "Meloni left the series following Season 12 in 2011 after failed contract negotiations. The show picked up the next season with Benson unable to get in touch with Stabler, who didn\u2019t return to work after shooting and killing a young girl wielding a gun in the precinct. The unit\u2019s captain at the time, Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), informed Benson that her partner \u201cput his papers in\u201d and wouldn\u2019t be returning.",
      "Fans had all but given up on Meloni ever reprising Stabler until news broke in 2020 that he would bring the character back for a new NBC series called \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime.\u201d His return was part of a crossover event between a Season 22 episode of \u201cSVU\u201d and the series premiere of \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d on April 1, 2021. Stabler crashed back into Benson\u2019s life on \u201cSVU\u201d when he called her for help after his wife, Kathy Stabler (Isabel Gillies), was injured in a car bombing. Kathy died at the end of the episode, which spurred Stabler\u2019s mission to continue on \u201cOC\u201d to get justice for his wife and find her killer.",
      "Kathy\u2019s death also seemed to finally open the door for the possibility of a romance between Benson and Stabler. A lot has happened between them since Stabler\u2019s return, including an \u201cI love you\u201d confession, a twisted love(?) letter, some hand-holding, feelings confessions from them both and a near-kiss that was \u201cchanged at the last minute,\u201d according to Hargitay.",

      "See Benson and Stabler together again in 'Law & Order: Organized Crime' teaser",
      "Peacock released a teaser Wednesday, April 9, showing Benson at Stabler's bedside in the hospital.",
      "In the video, Stabler's boss, Sgt. Ayanna Bell (Danielle Mon\u00e9 Truitt), asks him to go undercover again.",
      "Tense scenes of Stabler in action flash throughout until he gets hit by a semitruck. Then the teaser cuts to Stabler being wheeled into the hospital with Bell at his side.",
      "And then ...",
      "\"Elliot,\" a voice, which fans will recognize as Benson's, says.",
      "The trailer concludes with Benson staring intensely at Stabler with his eyes closed in his hospital bed.",
      "Meloni told TODAY.com last summer he was writing the second episode of \u201cOC\u201d Season Five and teased a guest appearance from Hargitay in the upcoming season.",
      "\u201cOh, girlfriend\u2019s coming on,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "Hargitay opened up in an interview with TODAY.com in October about what it was like to guest star in an episode written by her close friend.",
      "\u201cIt was, you know, daring. It was risk-taking. It was moving. It was out of the box, the way he thinks,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was so fresh and so intimate.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a joy to say his words,\u201d Hargitay added. \u201cIt was a joy to work on it with him. He\u2019s an incredible director, an incredible leader and just an incredible artist.\u201d",
      "More recently, Hargitay and Meloni were spotted on the set of \u201cSVU.\u201d\u00a0So, there\u2019s a chance Stabler may pop up there first on NBC, which is also airing the Season Five \u201cOC\u201d premiere at 10 p.m. ET on April 17 following \u201cSVU.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust leaving this here \ud83d\udc6f\u200d\u2642\ufe0f,\u201d Hargitay captioned a series of photos on Instagram of herself with Meloni on set March 19.",
      "The next day, Meloni shared two selfies he took with Hargitay.",
      "\u201cSo I bumped into this one on the street @therealmariskahargitay,\u201d he wrote on Instagram.",
      "What happened in Benson and Stabler\u2019s last scene together on \u2018Law & Order\u2019?",
      "Benson and Stabler physically haven\u2019t shared the screen since the \u201cOrganized Crime\u201d Season Three finale, \u201cWith Many Names,\u201d which was part of a crossover event with the \u201cSVU\u201d Season 24 finale, \u201cAll Pain Is One Malady,\u201d that aired May 18, 2023.",
      "Benson got shot for the first time ever in the \u201cOC\u201d episode. She and Stabler took down the shooter together before he carried her, bridal style, to safety \u2014 and urgent care \ud83d\udc40.",
      "In the final scene, Stabler visited Benson in her office and gifted her a compass necklace, which Hargitay revealed to TODAY.com she and Meloni designed together.",
      "\u201cElliot, this is beautiful,\u201d Benson told him, before asking if the necklace is \u201csupposed to lead\u201d her somewhere \u2014 or to something.",
      "Stabler said, \u201cLead you to happiness, Liv.\u201d",
      "\u201cI sure as hell am going to try,\u201d Benson responded.",
      "\u201cMe too,\u201d Stabler said.",
      "Benson wore the necklace in the following season of \u201cSVU,\u201d though she didn't physically cross paths with him on \u201cSVU\u201d or \u201cOC.\u201d",
      "In the \u201cSVU\u201d Season 25 finale, which aired May 16, 2024, Benson loaned the necklace to someone else and shared the news during a phone call with Stabler in the last scene.",
      "\u201cI wanted to let you know that it has been incredibly meaningful to me,\u201d she told Stabler of the necklace. \u201cIt has guided me, in terms of my healing.\u201d",
      "After Benson told Stabler she \u201clent\u201d the necklace to a victim\u2019s mother, Stabler said: \u201cSounds like she needed it a lot more than you do.\u201d",
      "\u201cI knew you\u2019d understand,\u201d Benson replied.",
      "Why has it taken so long for Benson and Stabler to appear on screen together again?",
      "It\u2019s not exactly clear why the characters haven\u2019t shared the screen  in nearly two years.",
      "In May 2024, Peacock announced \u201cOC\u201d would be moving from NBC to the streaming service for Season Five, which led fans to wonder if characters from broadcast TV\u2019s \u201cSVU\u201d could still cross over with streaming\u2019s \u201cOC,\u201d and vice versa. The answer to that one is a definite yes given Hargitay\u2019s upcoming appearance on \u201cOC\u201d and the recent Meloni spotting on the \u201cSVU\u201d set with Hargitay.",
      "\u201cSVU\u201d showrunner David Graziano told TODAY.com in 2022 that \u201csome of the considerations about Benson and Stabler have nothing to do with narrative and they\u2019re about just logistics of these two actors\u2019 (Hargitay and Meloni) busy schedules.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got to think for a second about the 'OC': Chris Meloni is in every single scene of that show, and they just can\u2019t lend him out the same way we can sort of give them Mariska for a day or two,\u201d he explained. \u201cEven when we give her over there for a day or two, we feel hobbled without her.\u201d",
      "Both shows have also reportedly experienced showrunner shake-ups in recent months.",
      "In November, \u201cOC\u201d showrunner John Shiban exited the series while the show was still filming its fifth season, Deadline reported, with original showrunner Matt Olmstead returning as executive producer to finish out the season. The series has also reportedly cycled through multiple showrunners across the five seasons, according to Deadline.",
      "More recently, news broke that \u201cSVU\u201d will be helmed for the first time by a woman after Season 26. Deadline reported April 1 that Michele Fazekas will take over as \u201cSVU\u201d showrunner after Graziano finishes his three seasons with the show. Fazekas previously worked on \u201cSVU\u201d in the early 2000s as a producer and writer.",
      "The show, like \u201cOC,\u201d has yet to be officially renewed for another season.",
      "The first two episodes of \"Law & Order: Organized Crime\" Season Five drop Thursday, April 17, on Peacock, with a special telecast of the first episode airing on NBC at 10 p.m. ET after new episodes of \"Law & Order\" and \"Law & Order: SVU\" at 8 and 9 p.m.",

      "Gates, at the start of the episode, recalled a formative moment in his life: Looking at a photo of his great-great grandmother, Jane Gates, the oldest known family member in his ancestry. From the age of 9 on, he was obsessed with family histories.",
      "\u201cThe woman who sparked this fascination also harbored my family\u2019s biggest secret,\u201d he said.",
      "Growing up, he was told Jane Gates had five children and they all had the same father. But who?",
      "The Gates family had a theory the father of Jane Gates' children was a man named Samuel Brady \u2014 which Moore proved wrong in the episode. Though Gates and his relatives did have one element correct: The father of at least one of Jane\u2019s children was a wealthy white landowner.",
      "Moore uncovered genetic evidence that Jane Gates\u2019 youngest child was fathered by Charles Wesley Kelley, a farmer. Kelley was killed at 35 years old by lightning while closing a window, according to a local paper.",

Kelley. And, I\u2019m sorry he was killed by laughing, it\u2019s just not what I expected.\u201d",
      "Moore believed Kelley did not father all of Jane Gates\u2019 children and possibly never met Edward Gates, moving to Illinois before his son was born.",
      "Moore also found more details about Gates' ancestry that he said shocked him even more. She was able to zoom back into Kelley\u2019s family tree to find Gates\u2019 third great-grandmother, a woman named Hannah Kelley (maiden name Stotler).",
      "Through the Stotler name, Moore learned more about Jane Gates\u2019 life in slavery. She was listed as a \u201cpiece of property\u201d in an estate record of Christian Stotler, Hannah Kelley\u2019s brother.",
      "\u201cThis is so stunning. I am just floored,\u201d Gates said. Wiping away tears, he said, \u201cThis is the most amazing discovery that I could have.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just can\u2019t believe it. After all this looking. This is just going to floor everybody,\" he continued.",
      "It appeared Jane Gates met Charles Kelley through his uncle, Christian Stotler. Stotler freed Jane Gates after three years, but indicated that her sons should be sold, though not out of state.",
      "\u201cBoy, that\u2019s cold. He was freeing the mother but keeping her sons in bondage,\u201d Gates said. \u201cThat\u2019s cold and cruel. I would have been devastated.\u201d",
      "When Stotler died, Jane Gates and her two sons were sold to none other than Samuel Dunlap Brady, whom the Gates family initially believed to be the father of Jane Gates\u2019 children. Her sons remained in slavery while she was eventually freed.",
      "\u201cThey were close, they just didn\u2019t get it right,\u201d said Gates. \u201cThis is astonishing.\u201d",

      "\u201cI have a great family tree but the box next to Jane Gates was empty. All we knew was that he was white. If something like this is in the atmosphere of your family, you become obsessed with it,\" he continued.",
      "\"Every time there was a family gathering, people would argue. They always picked the richest or smartest white people in Cumberland, Maryland as the candidate,\" he continued.",

    "story": [
      "Netflix\u2019s \u201cMillion Dollar Secret\u201d just dropped its season finale and a millionaire has officially been crowned.",
      "The last two episodes were filled with intense challenges and stone-cold deception as the remaining players fought to stay in the running.",
      "It all culminated in a nail-biting game of chance between finalists Samantha Hubbard, Corey Niles and Cara Kies. At the time, Cara was the millionaire \u2014 the money was reshuffled to her box at the beginning of Episode 7.",
      "By placing first and second in the needle threading challenge, Cara and Corey secured advantages in the final game.",
      "As they stood in front of their respective boxes, Cara and Corey each had one turn to shuffle the contents of everyone\u2019s box in hopes of snagging or keeping the million dollars. The catch? They couldn\u2019t see what the other person\u2019s move was.",
      "In the end, Cara, a 29-year-old In-N-Out line cook, played her cards right and opened her box to a million dollars, making her the winner of the show.",
      "Cara sat down with TODAY.com to talk all about her win and the moments that led up to it.",
      "I plan on foremost, just helping my family. We\u2019ve experienced back-to-back losses on so many things and never anything good.",
      "Just helping them, my husband, and just making sure we\u2019re all good \u2014 that\u2019s all I could ask for.",
      "They are so happy for me, they all know what a dream come true this is! My dad is getting text messages from his coworkers that would never watch Netflix and they\u2019re all just so proud.",
      "I think I honestly have been preparing myself for this for a very long time because I am such a gamer. I love \u201cThe Challenge,\u201d \u201cSurvivor,\u201d and \u201cBig Brother\u201d and I just wanted to see how I could play a game like that. When I got this opportunity I couldn\u2019t believe it, and then I just mentally was like, I can do this, I can do this, I have to do this.",
      "I think just mentally preparing myself up until the second I got there, even the second I left, I just was constantly reminding myself that you got this \u2014 this is what you\u2019ve been training yourself for all these years.",
      "Yes and no. Because I am such a gamer, I know how important alliances are and being aware that if you\u2019re not in the conversation, they\u2019re talking about you and just keeping those mental notes. But then playing this game that we\u2019ve never seen on TV before, never have done it, and things are being thrown at us \u2014 it was nerve-wracking.",
      "I\u2019m not a good liar in real life at all. I hate lying and that\u2019s what I was nervous about. But when you put a million dollars in front of me, I will do whatever it takes. I\u2019m going to be a whole different person when I lie.",
      "I tried to play as true to myself as I could. I played majority just as I am as a person, but when I received the million dollars I was like, OK, I have to get it together and play as hard as I can and not be different because I\u2019ve been the same person this entire time. That\u2019s who I am, but now there\u2019s a lot on the line.",
      "You\u2019ve got to lie, you\u2019ve got to send some friends home that mean a lot and that definitely ate me alive. I really struggled with that, but at the end of the day, I just kept reminding myself how important this is for me and my family.",
      "I was surprised I had a poker face! People have told me that they could read the expressions on my face really well, so I was shocked by that.",
      "I\u2019m a very intuitive person, I\u2019ve always been that way since I was a kid, and I really lean into it and trust it.",
      "When I was sitting in the room and knowing that someone was going to get a clue about me, I just said a prayer and two things popped in my head. My middle name being Lydia, and my sisters \u2014 it just kept coming to me. I don\u2019t know what it was, it could\u2019ve been my brothers, you know? Something was telling me it\u2019s my sisters.",
      "Sam was the first conversation I even had when I got out of the room and as soon as she asked me (how many sisters I had), the answer just flew out of my mouth because I just knew that\u2019s what it was going to be.\u00a0(Ed. note: Cara lied about how many sisters she had to throw Sam off).",
      "Same thing with Corey, I kept my alliance close because I got to know them as people and I got to see how they lied, when they got nervous, or what they were really thinking. I built that bond with them to hopefully take me to the end but also do what it takes to win. Knowing that he knew deep down I was the millionaire, I think it\u2019s just because I really got to know them on a different level, and it helped me in the end.",
      "Yes, I actually had an alliance with almost every single person there with maybe the exception of Sydnee. We all still keep in touch and talk a lot with each other. We are very bonded; we did this experience together and it\u2019s beautiful. Even though things have come out about each other, we still remember we played the game and we still really care about each other."

Discovery announced April 8. The movie will examine Mansfield\u2019s life before her tragic death in a car accident at the age of 34. Hargitay, who is also the daughter of late bodybuilder and actor Mickey Hargitay, was only 3 years old when her mother died.",
      "\u201cThe film follows Mariska as she seeks to know, understand, and embrace her mother for the first time,\u201d a synopsis of the documentary said. \u201cThrough intimate interviews and a collection of never-before-seen photos and home movies, she grapples with her mother\u2019s public and private legacy and discovers the layers and depth of who Jayne was, not only to her audience but to those who were closest to her.\u201d",
      "Hargitay, who produced the film as well, shared a statement that described the movie as \u201ca labor of love and longing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a search for the mother I never knew, an integration of a part of myself I\u2019d never owned, and a reclaiming of my mother\u2019s story and my own truth,\u201d she said.",
      "She added, \u201cI\u2019ve always believed there is strength in vulnerability, and the process of making this film has confirmed that belief like never before.\u201d",
      "Hargitay and HBO\u2019s official Instagram account also uploaded a joint post that confirmed the documentary will also stream on Max in June. The post included a sweet childhood photo of Hargitay smiling as she wrapped her arms around her mom.",

      "Hargitay later shared another Instagram post with a black-and-white image of her and her mother.",
      "\u201cI feel grateful, fulfilled and so proud to share this film. I never got to make a movie with my mom, and she never got to make the kind of movies she wanted to make,\u201d she wrote.",
      "She added that the documentary is \u201ca place of meeting\u201d for her and Mansfield.",
      "\u201cWords fail me to describe how meaningful it is to tell her story, my own, and ours together,\u201d Hargitay wrote.",
      "Over the years, Hargitay has frequently paid tribute to Mansfield on her birthday and on the anniversary of her death. She has also reflected on how losing a parent at a young age affected her.",
      "In an interview with Glamour in 2021, she spoke about how the tragedy made her grow up faster.",
      "\u201cI think I learned about crisis very young, and I learned very young that s--- happens and there\u2019s no guarantees, and we keep going. And then we transform it,\u201d she shared. \u201cThat\u2019s been kind of my superpower, and the gift of having trauma early in life. I\u2019ve spent the last 50 \u2014 how old am I? \u2014 57, so 54 years sort of trying to figure out what happened and why, and what am I supposed to do with it?\u201d",
      "Hargitay continued, \u201cI clearly was in that frozen place for a lot of my childhood \u2014 of trying to survive, actually trying to survive. My life has been a process of unpeeling the layers and trust and trusting again.\u201d",
      "A year later, the actor commemorated her mom on the 55th anniversary of her death with an Instagram post. She uploaded a black-and-white photo of Mansfield on June 29, 2022, and wrote, \u201cWe live to love you more each day.\u201d",

She added a similar caption that said, \u201cHappy birthday Mama. We live to love you more each day.\u201d",

      "Christina Applegate and Jamie-Lynn Sigler both live with multiple sclerosis, but they have different views of how the disease factors into their lives.",
      "The two award-winning actors spoke with former TODAY co-anchor Hoda Kotb in an emotional interview on the April 9 episode of Hoda's \"Making Space\" podcast about the role MS plays in how they see themselves.",
      "Applegate, 53, and Sigler, 43, were asked whether MS defines them, and their answers showed the different experiences of those living with a disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system.",
      "\"I think that it's been a journey of acceptance,\" said Sigler, a former star of \"The Sopranos\" who has been living with MS for 23 years. \"Just a true learning experience of acceptance, surrender to what is, and acknowledging the lessons that it brings, but also the gifts.\"",
      "\"I think that MS doesn't define me, but it has absolutely shaped me into somebody that I wouldn't want to know without the experience,\" she added. \"Of course, I would love to not struggle in my body. I would love to not have a disability. I would love to be able to participate in my life the way I would choose to, but the way that I look at the world, and the way that I feel about people, I don't know if it would be the same without this.\"",
      "Applegate, who shared in 2021 that she had been\u00a0diagnosed with MS, is in a different place.",
      "\"I am defined by it right now,\" she said. \"I'm 3 \u00bd years in. I have days where I can't even walk to the bathroom, so I am defined by it. I'm angry at it still, and there's a lot of us out there who are newly diagnosed that are not quite ready to accept this reality. I keep thinking that I'm just going to wake up from this nightmare, and it's just going to be over.\"",
      "The \"Anchorman\" star was blunt in expressing how MS has worn her down, but that there is no \"right\" way to live with the disease.",
      "\"I want to do these things and I can't, and it feels like I'm getting worse,\" she said. \"And that's disheartening. But then there's like this voice inside of me that is like, 'You've got to believe in a miracle. You've got to believe in another side of this.'",
      "\"That's just kind of where I'm at right now, which is not very inspiring to anyone,\" she continued. \"If someone listening to me goes, 'Oh my God, I feel that way, and I feel like I'm not doing it right.' There is no doing MS right.\"",
      "\"No, there's not,\" Sigler agreed.",
      "Sigler had similar raw emotions to Applegate when she was first diagnosed with MS but felt hesitant to express them.",
      "\u201cThey were feelings that I didn\u2019t think \u2014 I wouldn't allow myself to feel or didn\u2019t think I deserve to feel for way too long,\u201d Sigler said. \u201cSo I think in the beginning of her journey with this, for her to be able to express herself like this, I admire.\u201d",
      "Applegate also shared a glimpse into what she regularly endures while living with MS, which can cause fatigue, memory difficulties, mood changes, mobility issues, numbness, pain, tingling, and vision impairment, according to The National Multiple Sclerosis Society.",
      "\"I went to go to the dentist yesterday, and it was a half-an-hour appointment, and it was like the most miserable hour and a half of my life,\" she said. \"Just getting down my stairs, getting into the car, getting into the parking lot, getting into the elevator, going into the office, like the whole thing was not even an hour and a half. And by the time I got home, I was like, 'I can't move anymore.' And that's, that's the stuff that makes me (say) that I can't accept it yet because I'm mad still.\"",
      "Applegate shared on the March 18 episode of the \"MeSsy\" podcast about MS that she co-hosts with Sigler that she has endured \"upwards of 30\" hospital visits since her diagnosis.",
      "She spoke to Hoda about revealing she had MS after she required a wheelchair on the set of the third season of Netflix's \"Dead to Me.\"",
      "\"You're going to notice that I'm different,\" she said. \"You're going to notice in the show that I look different. You're going to notice that I'm sitting in all the scenes. And if you see me out, you're going to notice that I can't walk without a cane.\"",
      "\"It would all happen so quickly \u2014 from my first symptoms, which were very mild,\" she continued. \"There was some tingling in my toes, to five months later, from my knees down. I can't feel, and it hurts, and it's awful, and it's like a 24/7 thing now. I had to protect myself by saying, 'Hey, this is what's going on. Please just let me be.'\"",
      "Sigler and Applegate also opened up about what it's like to have people constantly asking them about their health. Hoda likened it to when she was being treated for breast cancer, where it felt like her illness was the only thing people would talk to her about.",
      "Applegate, who is a breast cancer survivor herself, recalled commiserating with a friend at a party recently about a similar issue.",
      "\"She had just been through this thing, and we get there, and she just comes over to me, and she goes, 'How many more times are people going to be like, 'Are you OK?' And I said, 'Yeah, dude I can't handle it. I got to leave.' She's like, 'Yeah, I think we need to leave.'",
      "'I said, 'I can't, not one more person. I can't have one more person come up and be like, 'How are you? Are you OK?' And both of us were like, 'F' no, we're not OK. Do you understand that part? Why are you asking if we're OK? You know what both of us have gone through. We're not OK. And if you don't want to hear a long, sad story, don't ask the effing question, man!'\"",
      "As for the physical effects of MS, Sigler finds that practicing daily meditation helps her push through difficult moments. She said her son recently asked her what she thinks about and what she sees when she's meditating.",
      "\"I was like, 'Well, there is a visualization I have very often, and it's me running, again, on a beach towards my children,'\" Sigler said. \"It's beautiful. It is my greatest wish. And I love it.\"",
      "Her son then asked her if she's sad when she finishes meditating because she can't run on a beach with her kids.",
      "\"I said, 'No, I'm actually so happy because that was real. In my meditation, when I run to you, it felt real in every cell of my body, and no one can take that away from me. While, yes, now I'm going to struggle to get up and limp towards the kitchen to make you your snack, I just ran to you for 20 minutes, and it's become my favorite part of the day.'",
      "\"Whether it's another dimension, an alternate reality, or I'm just crazy, whatever it is, it's medicine,\" she said."

      "Chicken jockey! Flint and steel! The Nether!",
      "There's a high chance that these phrases mean nothing to most adults. But if you went to see \"A Minecraft Movie\" during its opening weekend, you've probably heard those words shouted at high volume.",
      "\u201cA Minecraft Movie,\u201d starring Jack Black as \u201cSteve,\u201d killed it at the box office, with a $163 million opening weekend. The memes it has spawned \u2014 as well as the wild crowd reaction in movie theaters \u2014 has made it a cultural phenomenon. In some cases, movie theaters have banned unaccompanied minors or even called in the police to handle the uproar over, of all things, \u201cchicken jockey.\u201d",
      "Buzz around the movie, based on the second-best-selling video game of all time, grew through trailers that were amplified on social media.",
      "Of all the phrases, none is more prominent than \"chicken jockey.\" Once a harmless internet joke, it's now an infamous battle cry ringing out in theaters nationwide.",
      "During a scene in the movie when Jason Momoa's character in \"A Minecraft Movie\" has to fight against the \"chicken jockey,\" or a baby zombie from \"Minecraft\" saddling a chicken, fans have been yelling the phrase in theaters in sync with Black's character.",
      "Here's what to know about \"chicken jockey\" and the other phrases from \"A Minecraft Movie\" taking over the internet pixel by pixel.",
      "What does 'chicken jockey' mean?",
      "\"Chicken jockey\" refers to a baby zombie riding a chicken.",
      "Jack Black's character \"Steve\" exclaims the phrase in \"A Minecraft Movie,\" a reference to one of the in-game  enemies that players may confront when exploring the blocky landscape in a \"Minecraft\" world.",
      "In the game, the chicken jockey is a rare occurrence of a type of baby zombie spawning in a \u201cMinecraft\u201d world where the baby zombie rides astride a chicken, and becomes a speedy and dangerous foe.",
      "In the movie and trailer, Momoa's character, Garrett, is forced to fight against an unassuming foe: a chicken. A crate hangs above the chicken and drops a baby zombie onto the chicken's back.",
      "Hence, as Steve explaims, \"Chicken jockey!\"",
      "(This is not to be confused with \"Steve's Lava Chicken,\" which is an entirely separate scene, and meme.)",
      "Why is the internet obsessed with 'chicken jockey?'",
      "After the release of the \"A Minecraft Movie\" trailer, the internet swiftly reacted to Jack Black exclaiming \"chicken jockey,\" along with  other phrases featured in the film.",
      "For some, Black's enthusiasm was infectious.",
      "\"I'm convinced they just gave jack black a blue shirt and told him to be himself,\" one fan said in the comments of a TikTok video from March 20, two weeks before the release of the film.",
      "Other fans of the game were just excited to see familar in-game icons get the silver screen treatment.",
      "\"The movie is just 2 hours of Jack Black naming most Minecraft items and blocks,\" said another fan in the comments of the same video.",
      "Why are kids shouting chicken jockey during 'A Minecraft Movie?'",
      "As soon as \"A Minecraft Movie\" opened, theaters began to get rowdy. Viral videos circulated showing fans screaming lines from the film, especially \"chicken jockey.\"",
      "One mom posted a video of her theater experience in a Facebook post.",
      "\"I\u2019m wondering if anyone else who saw the Minecraft Movie this weekend had the same experience\u2026 An almost sold out theater full of tween and teenage kids, mostly boys \u2014 literally screaming, cheering and clapping along,\" Amberly Hash wrote in her caption.",
      "\"Any major characters or statements, they all went berserk! It was awesomely hilarious,\" she posted.",
      "Some audiences took it too far. One theater in New Jersey is refusing to let kids see \"A Minecraft Movie\" unsupervised due to \"completely unacceptable behavior, including vandalism,\" from a group of unsupervised boys, the theater manager wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "\"If your son was at Township Theatre last night, we strongly encourage you to have a conversation with him about his behavior,\"  the post continued.",
      "In some cases, police have been called to the theater to escort out disruptors of the film, as documented in a TikTok.",
      "Other catchprases from \"A Minecraft Movie\"",
      "When Black's character Steve introduces himself in the movie, he says, with a dramatic pause, \"I ... am Steve!\" The line delivery has spawned various internet memes.",
      "Other popular lines include \"flint and steel,\" referencing tools Steve uses, and \"the Nether,\" an in-game underworld and another popular line delivery from Black.",
      "Other phrases that have sparked theatrical reactions include when Steve introduces \"the villagers,\" in-game non-player characters that love eating bread or, according to Steve, \"crushing loaf\" \u2014  another meme'd line from the movie."

      "When the realities of life get hard, does music get ... happy? \u201cRecession pop\u201d is currently trending as people reach for the music of the mid-2000s for a mood boost.",
      "Anecdotally, these songs maybe do have healing powers. The other day, after receiving disappointing news, I put in my headphones and went for a walk. Instead of blasting my usual playlist of Taylor Swift and Ren\u00e9e Rapp, I reached for a 2010s playlist, hoping some carefree hits would cheer me up.",
      "And you know what? It worked. While \"recession pop\" may be the nickname for music released during a recent economic downturn, there is no mood deficit involved here.",
      "What is 'recession pop'?",
      "Recession pop refers to the slew of hits that dominated the charts during the global financial crisis, which was from late 2007 to 2009.",
      "As the stock market plummeted, pop artists released cheery songs with positive and upbeat lyrics, focused on living in the moment and partying. The melodies were catchy, punctuated by inspiring choruses.",
      "\"Throughout the history of popular music, folks have always looked to music for escapism at tough times and for release during stressful moments,\u201d Bill Werde, director of Bandier Music Business Program at Syracuse University, tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just usually happy, escapist, catchy tunes that people find easy to sing along to, easy to dance to, easy to party to \u2014 all in the service of helping them escape their troubles,\u201d he adds.",
      "Some prime examples of recession pop are \u201cTik ToK\u201d by Kesha  (2010) , \u201cDJ Got Us Fallin\u2019 In Love\u201d by Usher (2010), \u201cParty in the USA\u201d by Miley Cyrus (2009), \u201cClub Can\u2019t Handle Me\u201d by Flo Rida (2010), \u201cI Gotta Feeling\u201d  by the Black Eyed Peas (2009) and \u201cDon\u2019t Stop the Music\u201d by Rihanna (2007).",
      "Werde, who served as Billboard\u2019s editorial director during the peak of \u201crecession pop,\u201d says Billboard didn\u2019t call it \u201crecession pop\u201d then, but from the charts, he was able to \u201crecognize that in a moment where a lot of people were struggling, people really just needed some release.\u201d",
      "Why is 'recession pop' making a comeback?",
      "The comeback is twofold. Millennials who grew up with this music appear to be reaching for the music during another time of economic instability and recession fears.",
      "As one TikToker said, \u201cIf we can\u2019t afford eggs we might as well do it while dancing.\"",
      "\u201cStock markets crashing but at least we got this banger,\u201d another said in a video set to Lady Gaga's new \u201cAbracadabra.\u201d",
      "Werde believes that the return of these dance pop anthems comes down to the political climate of the country.",
      "\u201cWe are in one of the most polarized moments in American history,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd while some people might think that that would show up as political music, angry music, that\u2019s just not what we\u2019ve seen. Looking at the history of the charts, in fact, the darker and tougher things get, generally, the dancier, the more escapist our pop music becomes.\u201d",
      "He notes past examples to prove his point, like the songs that topped the charts during the Vietnam War. Marvin Gaye\u2019s \u201cWhat\u2019s Going On\u201d (which Werde calls \u201cthe all time greatest politically conscious songs ever released\u201d) peaked at No. 2 on Billboard\u2019s charts in 1971.",
      "\u201cIf you look at what\u2019s at No. 1, it\u2019s a Temptations song, \u2018Just My Imagination.\u2019 If you look at what\u2019s at No. 3, it\u2019s Three Dog Night\u2019s \u2018Joy to the World.\u2019 And then if you look at what\u2019s rounding out the Top 10, it\u2019s Tom Jones, the Partridge Family, and Paul McCartney. It\u2019s kind of always been like this. I think sometimes we rewrite history in our minds, but the truth is, it is very common that the darkest, most divisive times in history, our pop charts often seem the lightest,\" he says.",
      "Recession pop is also having a moment because, coincidentally, artists who were big during the Great Recession are returning with new music, like Kesha, Lady Gaga and Katy Perry.",
      "As one X user summarized, \u201cThe economy is collapsing. Therefore as it is written, Kesha returns as the queen of recession pop.\u201d",
      "Werde says Lady Gaga in particularly has been \u201creally genius in understanding the pulse of culture,\u201d adding that \u201cit\u2019s notable that she has chosen this moment to return to form largely of the Gaga of that period.\u201d",
      "Some social media users are noting the March release of \u201cSunrise on the Reaping\u201d by Suzanne Collins as another uncanny parallel between now and the Great Recession since Collins released the original \u201cHunger Games\u201d trilogy from 2008 to 2010.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re heading towards a recession, Kesha just dropped an absolute banger, I\u2019m obsessed with a Ryan Murphy show featuring a broadway diva and there\u2019s a new Hunger Games book\u2026.2010\u2019s here we come!\u201d one X user tweeted.",
      "Moving forward into 2025 and beyond, Werde thinks what's old will continue to be new again.",
      "\u201cPeople are looking a little bit more for either known artists that they can trust, maybe that bring back memories to a happier time, or they\u2019re looking for songs that have those anthem-like choruses that really speak to us. Things that help us look away (and) turn off the doom scrolling,\" he says."

      "\"That would be their weekend thing,\" she explains. \"The rest of the time, they'd have their nice, big fishing boat \u2014 but very sustainable, eco-friendly \u2014 and they'd have their own seafood shop or something. And she and her wife would probably have adopted a few kids.\"",

    "story": [
      "Just two days after the Season 3 finale of \"The White Lotus,\" the hit HBO show's creator Mike White responded to the series' composer announcing he was quitting the show due to creative differences between him and White.",
      "White, who also directed and executive produced the series, said in an interview with Howard Stern on April 8 that he didn't know what happened with Cristobal Tapia de Veer, the composer behind the music for the series since Season 1.",
      "\"I honestly don\u2019t know what happened, except now I\u2019m reading his interviews because he decides to do some PR campaign about him leaving the show,\" White said. \"I don\u2019t think he respected me.\"",
      "\"He wants people to know that he\u2019s edgy and dark and, I don\u2019t know, like I watch reality TV,\" he continued. \"We never really even fought. He says we feuded. I don\u2019t think I ever had a fight with him \u2014 except for maybe some emails. It was basically me giving him notes.\"",
      "White added that the thought Tapia de Veer didn't like the process of getting notes or wanting revisions from him because \"he didn't respect me.\"",
      "\"I knew he wasn\u2019t a team player and that he wanted to do it his way. I was thrown that he would go to\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0to s--- on me and the show three days before the finale,\" he said. \"It was kind of a b---- move.\"",
      "Stern replied that White was the director, and that the people on his team need to go along with his vision. He's also the writer and executive producer of the series.",
      "\"Honestly, that's why it did work the first couple of seasons, because we did go through the process,\" White said. \"But by the time the third season came around, he'd won Emmys, and I don't know, he had this song go viral, and so he just did not want to go through the process anymore. He didn't want to get notes from me.\"",
      "\"He would just always look at me, like he always had this, like, contemptuous smirk on his face, and whenever he was dealing with me because I just think he thought I was just a chimp or something,\" he continued.",
      "White said Tapia de Veer was \"definitely making a big deal out of just a creative difference of opinion,\" and added that he thought the composer was \"very talented.\"",
      "\"I have never kissed somebody's a-- so hard to just get him to, you know, to lead that horse to water,\" White said.",
      "\"He just didn't respect me,\u00a0I guess, so have fun doing whatever you're doing next,\" he added. \"I don't know, onwards for me.\"",
      "Just days before the finale aired on April 6, Tapia de Veer told The New York Times that he wouldn't be returning for Season 4 of \"The White Lotus\" after experiencing creative differences with the show's team.",
      "\"I announced to the team a few months ago that I was not coming back, that I was leaving. I didn\u2019t tell Mike for various reasons; I wanted to tell him just at the end for the shock and whatever,\" Tapia de Veer said. \"Except I told the whole editorial team and music editor and producer and all that, but I didn\u2019t think that they were going to tell him. At some point he heard about that.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer said there had been disagreements with the music since Season 1 of the show aired in 2021, and that he had not been given any direction for the theme song for Season 3.",
      "\"Enlightenment,\" the Season 3 theme, was a departure from the beloved tracks from previous seasons -- leaving viewers without the iconic vocals that devoted fans came to love in Season 2.",
      "\"I have, like, over 20 versions of that theme, with and without the ooh-loo-loo-loos. But of course, in the 1:45 titles that\u2019s allowed, there\u2019s nothing from the other ones,\" he said. \"That was kind of a risk, but we never talked about that. I don\u2019t think everybody was really aware of how attached people were to the ooh-loo-loo-loos.\"",
      "When the first episode of the new season aired in February, Tapia de Veer said he began getting calls for a statement about the new theme song.",
      "\"People are furious about the change of the theme, and I thought that was interesting,\" he said. \"I texted the producer and I told him that it would be great to, at some point, give them the longer version with the ooh-loo-loo-loos, because people will explode if they realize that it was going there anyway. He thought it was a good idea. But then Mike cut that \u2014 he wasn\u2019t happy about that.\"",
      "\"I mean, at that point, we already had our last fight forever, I think. So he was just saying no to anything. So I just\u00a0uploaded that to my YouTube,\" he added, referring to a longer version of the song he posted on March 19.",
      "While the backlash to the new theme song was immediate, as the season continued, the anger directed toward Tapia de Veer subsided, he said.",
      "\"At one point, people were like insulting me and sending me horrible things. And then I started seeing these videos: \u2018You know what, I used to hate the theme but now I\u2019m kind of dancing to it.\u2019 It\u2019s like they\u2019re transformed,\" he said. \"I was really excited about that.\"",
      "Tapia de Veer reflected on his choice to leave the 15-time Emmy award-winning show.",
      "\"I mean, it is what it is. You know, I was watching the Emmys, and it\u2019s like, there\u2019s one thing I\u2019m pretty proud of and that is I feel like I never gave up. Maybe I was being unprofessional, and for sure Mike feels that I was always unprofessional to him because I didn\u2019t give him what he wanted. But what I gave him did\u00a0this, you know \u2014 did those Emmys, people going crazy,\" he said.",
      "He added that he was happy with the risks he took for the series' music.",
      "\"That is the main thing that I\u2019m most happy about \u2014 it was worth all the tension and almost forcing the music into the show, in a way, because I didn\u2019t have that many allies in there,\" he said.",
      "\"I treasure that more than something else I did that was just a success, and it works and that\u2019s that, with less struggle,\" he continued. \"This was a good struggle.\""

      "In the final moments of Season 3, one of the few recurring characters, Belinda (Natasha Rothwell), does something devastatingly reminiscent of what Tanya (Jennifer Coolidge) did to her in Season 1.",
      "In the finale, Belinda receives a life-changing amount of money and chooses to leave Thailand early \u2014 dashing Pornchai\u2019s (Dom Hetrakul) dreams of starting an independent wellness center with her. Tanya makes a similar decision back in Season 1, going back on her offer to fund the same business for Belinda.",
      "The White Lotus posted a side-by-side of these endings on Instagram with the caption, \u201cFarewells are always bittersweet.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what to know.",
      "What happened between Tanya and Belinda in Season 1?",
      "Belinda is introduced in Season 1 as a spa manager at the White Lotus hotel in Maui.",
      "Over the course of the season, her character forms a bond with Tanya, an unstable heiress, by offering not only spa treatments but a level of emotional support that extends well beyond the role of a typical esthetician.",
      "Tanya takes a liking to Belinda, extending the offer to fund Belinda\u2019s dream of starting her own spa.",
      "But when Tanya connects with Greg (Jon Gries), an unexpected romantic interest whom she eventually goes on to marry, she focuses more on her new relationship than Belinda.",
      "Though Belinda goes the extra mile for Tanya, going so far as to offer emotional support as she grieves her mother\u2019s death, Tanya reneges on her promise to invest in the business.",
      "The season ends with Belinda waving at the boat carrying Tanya away from the resort, looking bereft.",
      "What happened between Belinda and Pornchai in Season 3?",
      "Belinda finds herself in Thailand in Season 3 of \u201cThe White Lotus\u201d as a participant in a months-long wellness exchange program. She's meant to learn the practices at the spa in the Thailand resort to bring them back to Maui, and teach her own techniques to the estheticians local to the Koh Samui resort.",
      "Belinda and Pornchai \u2014 who works at the Koh Samui resort spa \u2014 quickly fall for each other. Amid their flirtation, they float the idea of opening a spa together.Yet she, too, backpedals on this commitment, just as Tanya once did to her, when she comes into money.",
      "Here's how. In Season 2, Greg plotted to have Tanya murdered so he could inherit her fortune. When Belinda sees Greg in Thailand going by the name Gary, she does some Googling, and puts the pieces together. Greg offers her money in exchange for her silence. Belinda\u2019s son Zion negotiates the sum up from $100,000 to $5 million.",
      "Belinda, now flush, chooses to leave Thailand early. To creator White, this is something \u201chappy\u201d that comes out of Tanya\u2019s betrayal \u2014 even if it comes at the cost of Pornchai\u2019s dreams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s easy to be virtuous and have certain kinds of ideals when you have no money and don\u2019t have to really put your money where your mouth is. It\u2019s one thing to be, \u2018oh yeah, I\u2019m gonna do this spa for women,\u2019 whatever her sort of fantasy was \u2014 but she needs someone to bankroll it,\u201d he said on\u00a0\u201cThe White Lotus Official Podcast.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd then you\u2019ve got the money, and it\u2019s like, \u2018Can I just be rich for like five minutes?\u2019 I just feel like that\u2019s very honest. \u2018You know what, just let me enjoy this for a second,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "He\u2019s hopeful about what she'll do next. \u201cMaybe she will go and do something meaningful. And I think people do \u2014 I\u2019m not that cynical,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThat (choice to have her leave Pornchai behind) was actually an anchoring idea, that she would go and have this kind of Stella-gets-her-groove-back kind of thing with somebody there and is maybe fantasizing about maybe starting a business with this person, and then this windfall comes and it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m outta here. Sorry.\u2019\u201d",
      "Do Belinda and Tanya say the same thing? Not quite, star Rothwell says",

I mean, you\u2019re so talented and I so want to do this for you, but I\u2019m realizing I\u2019m getting back into this pattern again where I latch on to somebody and then I use my money to control them and see, right now, the last thing I need in my life is another transactional relationship. You know, it\u2019s just \u2014 it\u2019s not healthy for me, you know?\"",
      "Belinda starts sobbing \u2014 but years later, shares a similar sentiment to Pornchai upon her departure.",

      "\u201cWhat about the business?\u201d Pornchai asks in the Season 3 finale.",
      "\u201cMaybe! But, circumstances have changed for me, and I just can\u2019t commit to anything right now,\u201d Belinda answers.",
      "Pornchai is upset, and Belinda knows why. Tanya would have changed Belinda\u2019s life by giving her agency in her workplace. But Belinda is not Tanya, Rothwell said. She told The White Lotus Official Podcast there\u2019s a difference in how Belinda goes about the conversation.",
      "\u201cI think there\u2019s more grief on Belinda\u2019s part than perhaps Tanya\u2019s part,\u201d she says. \u201cTanya\u2019s about to go get d\u2014. So she\u2019s like, \u2018Bye girl. I gotta go.\u2019 Belinda\u2019s a little bit more heartbroken \u2014 and she doesn\u2019t say no. She\u2019s just like, \u2018Right now, I have to get my bearings \u2026\u2019 And I do think that maybe she\u2019d circle back,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI think if they look at it closely, you\u2019ll see she\u2019s departing with kindness. She reiterates multiple times \u2026 some things have changed and she just needs to wrap her head around those things, because her life just got really big,\u201d she said.",
      "Rothwell also told Variety that Belinda never led Pornchai on as much as Tanya led Belinda on.",
      "\"If people rewatch this season, she never agrees to go into business with Pornchai; she\u2019s just considering it. Which I think is a subtle but massive difference from Season 1, where you have Tanya being like, 'Yes, let\u2019s do it. Give me the papers. Show me your business plan.'She doesn\u2019t lead him on. Pornchai was definitely more into Belinda and the idea than Belinda was,\" she said.",
      "What does it all mean?",
      "It's a bittersweet full circle moment. In Season 1, Tanya leaves the door open with Belinda. \"I\u2019m going to call you,\" she says. This, perhaps, is Tanya's roundabout way of making good on the promise. The $5 million Belinda now has was once Tanya\u2019s, after all.",
      "Belinda's newfound freedom underlines another theme the \"White Lotus\" is interested in: The gap between the haves and the have-nots, and hotel staff and employees. Belinda, who was so long in the \"staff\" category, gets to experience how it feels to have money, and becomes cold in the process.",
      "There are other telling parallels between Belinda and Tanya. Both women gravitated toward what they did not originally have. Tanya had money, but leaves the hotel to chase love with Greg; Belinda had the potential for love with Pornchai, but leaves the hotel to truly experience what it's like to have money.",
      "Of course, none of this would have been possible without Greg, the most self-serving character of them all. He chooses to be with Tanya in Season 1, and to give Belinda her hush money in Season 3. This twisted, self-interested character \u2014 protecting his health in Season 1, wealth in Season 2 and freedom in Season 3.",
      "The final shots collapse the parallel between Belinda and Tanya. Tanya died on a boat in Season 2; the show ends with Belinda on a boat. It's almost like Belinda is picking up right where Tanya left off."

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The increasingly vicious trade war between Washington and Beijing took another turn Wednesday when China imposed an additional 50% tariff on imports from the U.S., hiking its levies on American imports to 84%.",
      "The tit-for-tat escalation came hours after President Donald Trump\u2019s 104% tariffs on Chinese imports went into effect, including 50% Trump added Monday. Later Wednesday, Trump increased the overall U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 125%, even as he paused higher targeted tariffs on other countries for 90 days while keeping a 10% baseline tariff in place for all countries.",
      "Trump\u2019s 50% tariff is a \u201cmistake upon another mistake,\u201d China\u2019s Customs Tariff Commission said in a statement earlier Wednesday, adding that the world\u2019s two biggest economies should \u201cresolve differences through equal dialogue based on mutual respect.\u201d",

      "U.S. exports of soybeans to China fell 75% after China imposed a retaliatory 25% tariff on them in 2018, during Trump\u2019s first-term trade war with Beijing.",
      "The Trump administration announced $12 billion in subsidies for farmers to offset the impact, and it has again promised to step in if the latest round of tariffs hurts the industry further.",
      "China could also put further restrictions on American poultry products, having announced an import ban on two U.S. companies last week.",
      "Hollywood movies",
      "China, which frequently trades places with North America as the world\u2019s largest box office, is a crucial market for Hollywood films. Though China has an annual quota for the number of foreign movies that can appear in its theaters, it could ban Hollywood films altogether.",
      "American movies have already been declining in popularity in recent years as U.S.-China trade tensions have escalated. There were no Hollywood films among China\u2019s 10 highest-grossing movies in 2023, in stark contrast to 2012, when seven of the top 10 highest-grossing movies were U.S.-made, according to Maoyan, a Chinese movie-ticketing and data platform.",
      "U.S. services sector and intellectual property",
      "The U.S. has a large trade deficit with China in goods, but it comes out ahead when it comes to services such as finance, consulting and law.",
      "U.S. data lists China as its fifth-largest export market for services, according to a report by China\u2019s State Council released Wednesday.",
      "China could target the U.S. services sector, for example, by excluding American companies from government procurement processes or restricting their cooperation with Chinese firms.",
      "The U.S. has long accused China of stealing its intellectual property. But Beijing also has its own growing intellectual property interests, and it could investigate U.S. companies in China in an effort to protect them.",
      "Fentanyl cooperation",
      "China and the U.S. have made progress on stemming the international flow of precursor ingredients for fentanyl, some of which originate in China and are then processed into the deadly opioid in countries such as Mexico before being smuggled into the U.S.",
      "But China could bring that cooperation to a halt in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",

      "More than 50,500 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on Israel, according to the Health Ministry there. Israel has said 1,200 were killed in the attack and around 250 were taken hostage.",
      "The conflict has been especially dangerous for media workers. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists, 2024 was the \u201cdeadliest year for journalists\u201d around the world, with Israel being \u201cresponsible for nearly 70 percent\u201d of those killed. Sunday\u2019s airstrike brought the number of journalists killed in Gaza since the start of the war to at least 175.",
      "On Monday, the New York-based committee, which is considered the world\u2019s leading advocate for media workers, denounced the attack and called on the international community to \u201cact to stop Israel killing Palestinian journalists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not the first time Israel has targeted a tent sheltering journalists in Gaza,\u201d CPJ Middle East and North Africa Director Sara Qudah said in the statement. \u201cThe international community\u2019s failure to act has allowed these attacks on the press to continue with impunity, undermining efforts to hold perpetrators accountable.\u201d",
      "Journalists are protected under international humanitarian law \u201cas long as they do not take a direct part in the hostilities,\u201d according to the International Committee of the Red Cross.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said that Aslih had \u201cparticipated\u201d in the Oct. 7 attacks and that he had documented and uploaded video of \u201clooting, arson and murder to social media.\u201d",
      "Israel has often asserted that journalists it has killed were either members of Hamas or supporters, frequently without providing clear evidence.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said it had taken \u201cnumerous steps\u201d to mitigate harm to civilians before it launched the strike Sunday, including the use of precise munitions, aerial surveillance and additional intelligence.",
      "Asked by NBC News on Tuesday whether it was aware that other journalists were at the tent camp when the strike was launched, the IDF shared its initial statement, which did not directly address the question."

    "summary": "Russian President Vladimir Putin has dispatched his close friend Kirill Dmitriev to Washington, while conscripting 160,000 new troops and bombing Kharkiv.",
    "story": [
      "To the casual observer, Russia seems to be marching in two opposite directions.",
      "President Vladimir Putin sent one of his close allies, Kirill Dmitriev, to Washington this week for diplomatic talks, the most senior Kremlin official to visit since Russia invaded Ukraine.",
      "At the same time, Putin ordered the mobilization of 160,000 troops, his largest in 14 years, as his drones continue their nightly bombardment of Ukrainian civilians and he plans a spring offensive \u2014 if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is to be believed.",
      "But these twin approaches perfectly illustrate Russia\u2019s strategy, according to some Western foreign policy specialists. They say that Putin is slow-walking talks with President Donald Trump so he can press his battlefield advance in Ukraine, while gambling on achieving normalized relations with a friendly White House.",
      "Putin \u201cthinks that time is on his side, and by dragging things out he\u2019ll put himself in an even better position to negotiate,\u201d said Sergey Radchenko, a Soviet-born Cold War historian and professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.",
      "Mixed messages",
      "Having once promised to end Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine in 24 hours, Trump has found the reality to be far thornier.",
      "His team has tried to broker a ceasefire, but so far even a partial or temporary truce has been blocked by the Russians. Putin and his envoys have said they will only accept a truce if Ukraine agrees to extreme conditions tantamount to surrender and subjugation.",
      "Many Western officials and experts say Russia knows these cannot be accepted.",
      "\u201cPutin continues to obfuscate, continues to drag his feet,\u201d British Foreign Secretary David Lammy told reporters Friday at the headquarters of NATO in Brussels. \u201cWe see you, Vladimir Putin. We know what you are doing.\u201d",
      "That frustration has been felt in the White House, which under Trump has taken a far friendlier approach toward the Kremlin than previous administrations.",
      "Trump told NBC News on Sunday he was \u201cpissed off\u201d when Putin reiterated his view that Zelenskyy should be ousted. Trump\u2019s inner circle is advising him not to hold a call with Putin until he commits to a ceasefire, two administration officials told NBC News on Thursday.",
      "Familiar envoy",
      "This growing dissatisfaction explains why Moscow dispatched Dmitriev, according to Oleg Ignatov, a senior analyst on Russia at the International Crisis Group in Brussels.",
      "\u201cDmitriev has direct access to Putin; in the Russian system, this is the most important thing a negotiator can have,\u201d Ignatov said. He also \u201chas his own connections in the United States.\u201d",
      "Dmitriev, 49, was born in Kyiv when it was part of the Soviet Union and heads the Russian sovereign wealth fund responsible for investing and growing the country's cash pile. He has a close relationship with Putin, who in February appointed him special envoy on international economic investment.",
      "Dmitriev studied at Stanford and got his MBA at Harvard before working for Goldman Sachs and McKinsey & Co.",
      "After meeting with Trump\u2019s officials, he did a round of broadcast interviews in which he talked up normalizing relations with Washington, Arctic cooperation and a minerals deal. He even said the Kremlin could be involved in Elon Musk\u2019s plan to put humans on Mars. Ukraine was mentioned in passing, but he did not mention it in his social-media summary of the trip.",
      "\u201cWithout doubt, we note a positive dynamic in our relations,\u201d he told journalists in Washington. \u201cA series of meetings will still be needed for us to resolve all our differences. But the main thing we see is a positive, constructive attitude.\u201d",
      "The significance of Dmitriev\u2019s visit may lie in the fact he is not a career diplomat.",
      "\u201cHis apparent closeness to Putin makes him more than just a messenger,\u201d said Pavel Baev, a research professor at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, a think tank. \u201cHe appears to be a person who can really engage in bargaining and compromise.\u201d",
      "Asked about Dmitriev\u2019s\u00a0trip, Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday that Moscow was \u201ccautiously optimistic.\u201d",
      "Pressing ahead",
      "But, to be clear, Dmitriev's main task is clearly to re-establish links with Washington \u2014 rather than signal any drawdown in Ukraine ambitions, according to experts such as Robert Hamilton, a retired U.S. Army colonel and now head of research at the Foreign Policy Research Institute.",
      "Dmitriev's mission \u201csignals that the Kremlin is interested in broadening the discussions with the U.S. and steering them away from Ukraine,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cWhat the Kremlin actually seeks is to sideline the Ukraine issue and pursue a broader reset with the U.S. that leaves Ukraine and Europe out of the process and frees Russia to continue its war.\u201d",
      "Some saw evidence of that this week in Putin\u2019s announcement that the annual spring conscription draft would take on 160,000 recruits, the largest in 14 years.",
      "\u201cA clear signal it wants peace (not!)\u201d Tymofiy Mylovanov, Ukraine\u2019s former economics minister, wrote on X.",
      "Some experts point out the draft is only slightly higher than in previous years, and by law the recruits are barred from participating in what Russia calls its \"special military operation\" in Ukraine. But it is nonetheless a symptom of Russia's growing militarization, a shift that has seen the entire economy retooled toward its war effort.",
      "In the short term, there are few signs Russia is slowing its war.",
      "One drone attack on Ukraine\u2019s second city of Kharkiv late Thursday killed five people and injured more than 30 others, officials said. Meanwhile, Zelenskyy told the French newspaper La Figaro last week he believes Putin is preparing a spring offensive.",
      "Russia\u2019s \u201cceasefire intentions are, as far as I can discern, nonexistent,\u201d Baev added. \u201cDmitriev is most probably sent in order to wriggle out of a tight corner.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump wants to bring back American manufacturing in ways that would reshape the United States economy to look more like China\u2019s. The campaign, which has led to a rapidly escalating trade war with China, has given ample social media fodder to Chinese and American observers alike.",
      "Announcing a series of sweeping tariffs in a move dubbed \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d Trump said last week that it will lead factories to move production back to American shores, boosting the U.S. economy after \u201cforeign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once beautiful American dream.\u201d",
      "In a Truth Social post Wednesday, Trump announced that he is raising tariffs on goods imported from China to 125%, up from the 104% that took effect the same day, due to \u201cthe lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets.\u201d\u00a0Higher targeted tariffs on other countries have been paused for 90 days, although the 10% baseline tariff will remain in place for all countries.",
      "Meme-makers and Chinese government officials have in recent days begun pointing out the irony of Trump\u2019s tariff-driven manufacturing pivot through AI-generated satire and political cartoons that have percolated online, with many American users boosting the jokes.",
      "One video poking fun at the Trump administration\u2019s attempted pivot to American manufacturing has accumulated millions of views on X since a user posted it on TikTok earlier this week. The clip, seemingly generated with artificial intelligence, showed workers sewing garments and assembling mobile devices in a factory, followed by a screen touting: \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d",
      "Official Chinese accounts have also gotten in on the fun. Last weekend, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, posted a meme appearing to mock Trump for imposing tariffs on several largely barren Antarctic islands inhabited by penguins rather than people.",
      "Some have been subtler with their critiques. On Monday, the Chinese Embassy reposted a clip of a 1987 speech by President Ronald Reagan, whose economic agenda hugely influenced mainstream Republican economics today. In it, Reagan staunchly defends free trade.",
      "\u201cWhen someone says, \u2018Let\u2019s impose tariffs on foreign imports,\u2019 it looks like they\u2019re doing a patriotic thing by protecting American products and jobs. And sometimes, for a short while, it works. But only for a short time,\u201d Reagan says in the clip, before launching into a list of consequences.",
      "Talk of tariffs dominated the trending searches on Weibo, one of the most popular social media platforms in China, on Wednesday. For hours, the top hashtag on the platform translated to: \u201cThe United States begs for eggs while fighting a trade war.\u201d",
      "While the online memes depict American factory workers toiling away at menial tasks, the Trump administration says that such jobs would be automated in revived U.S. factories and that employees would be doing higher-level work.",
      "\u201cOur high school-educated Americans \u2014 the core to our work force \u2014 is going to have the greatest resurgence of jobs in the history of America to work on these high-tech factories, which are all coming to America,\u201d Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday on the CBS News\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s calls to revive domestic manufacturing come as China has pushed to make its economy look more like that of the United States.",
      "China, which is trying to reduce its economic reliance on exports, has been struggling to encourage domestic consumption, expanding subsidies for microwaves, rice cookers, smartphones and other goods.",
      "At least in the short term, both the U.S. and the Chinese goals are \u201cpipe dreams,\u201d said Ian Johnson, formerly a senior fellow for China studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.",
      "\u201cChina has been trying for decades to promote consumption or to get people to consume more, but for a variety of reasons Chinese people aren\u2019t willing to do that,\u201d Johnson said in a phone interview Tuesday, citing the lack of social safety net that drives high levels of personal savings.",
      "\u201cThe government hasn\u2019t changed structural issues that hold back consumption,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSo until they do that, that\u2019s not going to work.\u201d",
      "On the U.S. side, Johnson said, \u201cit\u2019s difficult because the government is trying to turn back the clock and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fully possible, no matter how high the tariffs are.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re never going to bring back, for example, shoe manufacturing or things like that or textile manufacturing to the United States, because it\u2019s still going to be too expensive, even if you put 100% tariffs,\u201d he said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump said Wednesday he was pausing higher targeted tariffs for 90 days for most countries, a stunning reversal in his trade war that has sent markets reeling.",
      "Trump wrote on social media just before 1:30 p.m. that he came to the decision because more than 75 trading partners didn\u2019t retaliate and have reached out to the United States to \u201cdiscuss\u201d some of the issues he had raised.",
      "The pause didn\u2019t apply to China, which has retaliated \u2014 with 84% hikes. Trump instead raised duties for it to\u00a0125%, effective immediately.",
      "\u201cBased on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World\u2019s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.\u201d",
      "But the trade war isn\u2019t exactly over, and the pause didn\u2019t return the world to the time before Trump touched off the global instability; a 10% across-the-board duty will remain. For Canada and Mexico, goods covered by the U.S., Canada and Mexico trade agreement will continue to have no tariffs, while products that aren't exempt under the trade deal will have a 25% tariff. Canadian energy and fertilizer products will have a 10% tariff.",
      "It wasn\u2019t immediately clear which countries the pause would cover; the White House wouldn\u2019t say. Earlier Wednesday, the European Union voted to impose fresh retaliatory duties, but they aren\u2019t set to take effect until next week.",
      "And separate tariffs on imported autos, steel and aluminum will remain, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said later \u2014 while planned tariffs on items like lumber and pharmaceuticals are still on.",
      "It\u2019s not clear what prompted Trump to change his mind \u2014 he appeared to dig in just hours earlier, telling Americans \u201cBE COOL\u201d in a Truth Social post, and he suggested not that long ago that the tariffs could be permanent.",
      "\u201cI did a 90-day pause for the people that didn\u2019t retaliate, because I told them, \u2018If you retaliate, we\u2019re going to double it,\u2019\u201d Trump said Wednesday. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I did with China, because they did retaliate. So we\u2019ll see how it all works out. I think it\u2019s going to work out amazing.\u201d",
      "But markets have been in stunning turmoil \u2014 major stock indexes shed trillions of dollars in value, while alarming signals from the bond market set Wall Street on edge.",
      "When a false-at-the-time headline suggesting Trump would take a 90-day pause shot around the internet Monday, markets briefly surged. And a growing chorus of business leaders and Trump\u2019s allies have come out publicly against the tariffs, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.",
      "Markets soared on the surprising news Wednesday, with the S&P 500 climbing more than 9%, the tech-heavy Nasdaq closing up more than 12% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending nearly 3,000 points higher. Among the big gainers: Tesla stock was up 22%. Despite the gains, all three indexes were down from where they were a month ago and at the start of the year, and some investors questioned what the recent volatility could mean for the U.S. stock market longer-term.",
      "\"My portfolio of defensive stocks is green so I don\u2019t begrudge today\u2019s market. But I ask you, would you want to own highly volatile US stocks whose price depends on whether POTUS had a good night\u2019s sleep and woke up the next morning to reverse yesterday\u2019s policies?\" billionaire investor Bill Gross said on X.",
      "Goldman Sachs lowered its odds of a recession but said it is still forecasting minimal economic growth and a 45% probability of a recession given the remaining tariffs.",
      "Borrowing costs \u2014 which had surged early Wednesday as the tariffs took effect \u2014 also eased slightly, though not substantially, as some investors may fear a lingering fallout.",
      "Trump has been talking about tariffs as the solution for\u00a0U.S. economic problems since before he became president; he branded April 2 \u2014 when he unveiled the plan \u2014 \u201cLiberation Day,\u201d saying it would end decades of the country\u2019s being \u201clooted, pillaged, raped and plundered\u201d by other countries.",
      "The global markets recoiled, and last week $6.6 trillion alone was wiped out. Yet Trump and his allies had doubled down until Wednesday, arguing tariffs were necessary to return manufacturing to the United States and fill the nation\u2019s coffers with trillions of dollars in revenue that could be used to pay down debt or offset tax cuts.",
      "It\u2019s not clear how the White House expects the policies to fuel big gains now. With the lower 10% tariff rate left in place, there will be less incentive for companies to relocate production to the United States and less revenue being generated.",
      "After the news, Bessent sought to make the about-face into a negotiating tactic, insisting it was a way to scare countries to come to the negotiating table by demonstrating how high the United States was going to go.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump created maximum negotiating leverage for himself,\u201d he said.",
      "It\u2019s unclear how successful the United States will be at negotiating new trade agreements with other countries given Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again threats over the past several months. Previously, he had threatened sweeping tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada before he walked most of them back.",
      "And while markets surged higher Wednesday following Trump\u2019s\u00a0pause, economic uncertainty remains over what will come next in the U.S. trade war with China, which exports more than $400 billion worth of goods to the United States each year.",
      "Under Trump\u2019s new tariffs, the cost for U.S. companies importing goods from China has more than doubled. Those products include everything from toys and sneakers to televisions and iPhones.",
      "U.S. companies exporting their products to China are also caught up in the fray after China increased its tariffs on American goods like agriculture products and machinery. But the White House is downplaying that risk.",
      "\u201cWhat I am certain of is that what China is doing will affect their economy much more than ours because they have an export-driven, flood-the-world-with-cheap-exports model,\u201d Bessent said.",
      "Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on X that he sat with Trump as he posted the initial message, adding: \u201cThe world is ready to work with President Trump to fix global trade, and China has chosen the opposite direction.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration will now face the daunting task of trying to negotiate dozens of potentially complex and intricate trade deals in a three-month period.",
      "\"That is a huge task to negotiate simultaneously with that many trading partners over that many issues,\u201d said Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative\u2019s office during the Biden administration. \u201cWe have tariffs, non-tariff barriers, other non-trade related matters, all of those issues can get quite complicated quite quickly. Even with just a handful of trading partners, that would be a large undertaking.\""

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary \u2014 Thousands of protesters rallied for the fourth week in Hungary\u2019s capital on Tuesday, denouncing a new law passed by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s nationalist government banning LGBTQ Pride events.",
      "The legislation, fast-tracked through parliament in March, prohibits events depicting homosexuality to those under the age of 18 and has drawn comparisons to Russia\u2019s anti-LGBTQ policies. It comes as Orb\u00e1n\u2019s administration is increasingly accused of democratic backsliding ahead of national elections next year.",
      "The weekly protests in Budapest have persisted, and on Tuesday, demonstrators filled the Erzs\u00e9bet Bridge over the Danube, demanding the withdrawal of the law. Some planned to remain on the bridge throughout the night and said there were plans to shut down all five central Danube bridges.",
      "No violence was immediately reported.",
      "The law makes it an offense to hold or attend events such as Pride, which some legal experts and human rights groups say is Orb\u00e1n\u2019s latest crackdown on Hungary\u2019s LGBTQ community and an arbitrary restriction on the right to assembly.",
      "Vikt\u00f3ria Vajda, one of the protesters, said the time for trying to find common ground with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government \u201chas passed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf we don\u2019t stand up for the rights of minorities and for our own fundamental rights, then who will when they come for us?\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve reached the point where we have to stand up and say, \u2018No more\u2019.\u201d",
      "The protests have defied police orders to disperse from bridges and main thoroughfares in Budapest. And in a rare instance of a street protest outside the Hungarian capital, several hundred demonstrators in the eastern city of Miskolc also protested on Tuesday against the law.",
      "Orb\u00e1n, who critics say has eroded Hungary\u2019s democracy and overseen widespread corruption, has in recent years taken aim at the country\u2019s LGBTQ community, prohibiting same-sex adoption and \u2014 in a 2021 \u201cchild protection\u201d law \u2014 banning any LGBTQ content including in television, films, advertisements and literature that is available to those under 18.",
      "As part of the new law, authorities may use facial recognition tools to identify those who attend prohibited events \u2014 such as the popular Budapest Pride, which draws tens of thousands each year \u2014 and can issue fines for violators of up to 200,000 Hungarian forints ($545).",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party is pushing for a constitutional amendment next week that will codify the ban on public LGBTQ events. The Hungarian leader has also pledged to introduce new legislation that will ban demonstrators from blocking traffic on bridges and busy roads, arguing the right of assembly and expression cannot override the rights of commuters.",
      "J\u00e1nos Stummer, a member of the opposition Momentum party who was at the protest, said that while the ban on Pride was harmful to members of the LGBTQ community, the law is also about \u201cOrb\u00e1n unilaterally, arbitrarily deciding which events can be held in this country and which cannot.\u201d",
      "Orb\u00e1n\u2019s government argues that it\u2019s protecting children from \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "But with Orb\u00e1n\u2019s party lagging in polls, critics views the legislation as part of a broader effort to scapegoat sexual minorities and mobilize his conservative base."

      "Global drugmakers\u2019 stocks dropped across the board on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated\u00a0plans\u00a0for a \u201cmajor\u201d\u00a0tariff\u00a0on pharmaceutical imports, threatening an interwoven supply chain across the world, and as his country-specific reciprocal\u00a0tariffs took effect, leading to\u00a0more pain in global markets.",
      "Pharmaceutical imports were initially exempt from Trump\u2019s first set of reciprocal\u00a0tariffs last week but his administration has since indicated that levies on the sector, which in the past has been excluded from such actions, are coming.",
      "The U.S. president has said the\u00a0tariffs will incentivize drug companies to move operations to the U.S. However, analysts and\u00a0companies\u00a0have\u00a0raised concerns\u00a0about the difficulty in setting up manufacturing in the United States.",
      "Shares of major U.S. drugmakers such as Gilead Sciences, Pfizer, Merck\u00a0and Eli Lilly\u00a0fell between 2% and 4% in premarket trading.",
      "In Europe, a basket of healthcare stocks\u00a0.SXDP\u00a0fell 5% to its lowest since October 2022, leading losses among sectoral indexes on the region-wide STOXX 600. The index was heading for its biggest one-day drop since March 2020.",
      "Trump had also\u00a0threatened\u00a0the duties on Friday after his first set of \u201creciprocal\u201d\u00a0tariffs exempted pharma products. Trump has not said when and by how much he plans to raise taxes on pharma imports.",
      "\u201cWhile the details are scant, we are strongly opposed to\u00a0tariffs on any\u00a0pharmaceuticals\u00a0\u2014 these will likely do little to shift manufacturing back to the U.S.,\u201d said BMO Capital Markets analyst Evan Seigerman.",
      "\u201cGiven the complexity of the pharma supply chain, we do not expect the industry to make any major changes. These current\u00a0tariffs are being pursued under emergency powers, which at worse will last until the end of the current administration and could end sooner with an act of Congress,\u201d Seigerman added.",
      "Europe and the U.S. have interconnected supply chains for medicines. The U.S. depends on medicines partly produced in Europe that bring in hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue.",
      "E.U. medical and pharmaceutical product exports to the U.S. totalled about 90 billion euros ($97 billion) in 2023, according to the latest Eurostat data.",
      "Barclays analysts said in a note last week that Europe accounted for about 80% of the U.S. trade deficit in biopharma.",
      "They highlighted companies with a high share of U.S. revenue or limited U.S. manufacturing sites as potentially more affected, such as Argenx, UCB, or Novo Nordisk.",
      "Shares of AstraZeneca, GSK, Roche, Sanofi\u00a0, and Novartis\u00a0fell between 5% and 6.5% in Europe.",
      "In contrast, companies like AstraZeneca, Roche and Sanofi could be more immune given their diverse global manufacturing network and increasing manufacturing capabilities in the U.S., Barclays\u2019 analysts said.",
      "Meanwhile, Indian pharmaceutical stocks\u00a0closed nearly 2% lower, dragging down the benchmark Nifty 50 by 0.6%.",
      "IPCA Laboratories, Glenmark Pharma\u00a0and Biocon\u00a0were the top losers by percentage on the pharma index in Mumbai, ending the trading session between 4% and 5.5% lower.",
      "India\u2019s pharma exports to the U.S. mostly comprise generics, or cheaper versions of popular drugs. The U.S. accounts for a third of India\u2019s overall pharma exports."

    "summary": "The IMF said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout as President Javier Milei seeking overturn of country's old economy.",
    "story": [
      "The International Monetary Fund on Tuesday said it has reached a preliminary agreement with Argentina on a $20 billion bailout, providing a welcome reprieve to President Javier Milei as he seeks to overturn the country\u2019s old economic order.",
      "As a staff-level agreement, the rescue package still requires final approval from the IMF\u2019s executive board. The board will convene in the coming days, the IMF statement said.",
      "The fund\u2019s long-awaited announcement offered a lifeline to President Milei, who has cut inflation and stabilized Argentina\u2019s troubled economy with a free-market austerity agenda. His policies have reversed the reckless borrowing of left-wing populist governments that had brought Argentina infamy for defaulting on its debts. The country has received more IMF bailouts than any other.",
      "It came at a critical moment for South America\u2019s second-biggest economy. Pressure had been mounting on Argentina\u2019s rapidly depleting foreign exchange reserves as the government tightened rules on money-printing and burned through its scarce dollars to prop up the wobbly Argentine peso.",
      "Fears grew that if the government failed to secure an IMF loan, hard-won austerity measures would veer off-track and leave Argentina, once again, unable to service its huge debts or pay its import bills.",
      "The fresh cash gives Milei a serious shot at easing Argentina\u2019s strict foreign exchange controls, which could help convince markets of his program\u2019s sustainability. For the past six years, the capital restrictions have dissuaded investment, preventing companies from sending profits abroad and ensuring the central bank\u2019s careful management the peso, which is pegged to the dollar.",
      "Racking up 22 IMF loans since 1958, Argentina owes the IMF more than $40 billion. Most IMF funds have been used repay the IMF itself, giving the organization a fraught reputation among Argentines. Many blame the lender for the country\u2019s historic economic implosion and debt default in 2001.",
      "The IMF was wary of striking yet another deal with its largest debtor. But over the past 16 months, fund officials have praised Milei\u2019s austerity \u2014 a diet harsher than even the fund\u2019s typical prescription.",
      "A former TV personality and self-proclaimed \u201c anarcho-capitalist,\u201d Milei came to power on a vow to shrink Argentina\u2019s bloated bureaucracy, kill spiraling inflation, open the economy to international markets and woo foreign investors after years of isolation.",
      "Unlike Argentine politicians in years past who sought to avoid enraging the masses with brutal austerity, Milei has taken his chainsaw to the state, firing tens of thousands of state employees, dissolving or downgrading a dozen ministries, gutting the education sector, cutting inflation adjustments for pensions, freezing public works projects, lifting price controls and slashing subsidies.",
      "Critics note that the poor have paid the highest price for Argentina\u2019s rosy macroeconomic indicators. Retirees have been protesting weekly against low pensions, with the decrease in payments accounting for the largest share of Milei\u2019s budget cuts. Major labor unions announced a 36-hour general strike starting Wednesday in solidarity.",
      "Still, Milei has maintained solid approval ratings, a surprise that analysts attribute to his success in driving down inflation, which dropped to 118% from 211% annually during his first year in office. Flipping budget deficits to surpluses has sent the local stock market booming and its country-risk rating, a pivotal barometer of investor confidence, tumbling.",
      "\u201cThe agreement builds on the authorities\u2019 impressive early progress in stabilizing the economy, underpinned by a strong fiscal anchor, that is delivering rapid disinflation,\u201d the IMF said in announcing the agreement under a 48-month arrangement. \u201cThe program supports the next phase of Argentina\u2019s homegrown stabilization and reform agenda.\u201d",
      "It remained unclear how much money Argentina would receive up-front \u2014 a key sticking point in the most recent negotiations over the deal\u2019s details. Argentina is seeking a hefty payment upfront to replenish its reserves, even as IMF loans are usually disbursed over several years.",
      "Milei shared the IMF statement on social media platform X, attaching a photo that showed him hugging Economy Minister Luis Caputo. \u201cVavos!\u201d he wrote \u2014 apparently misspelling \u201cVamos!\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d in his excitement."

      "The three will serve out their sentences in the U.S. following the repatriation done in collaboration with the U.S. Embassy, Congolese presidential spokesperson Tina Salama said. The presidency said the Americans left Congo Tuesday morning.",
      "The State Department said it was aware of their transfer into U.S. custody and referred questions to the Department of Justice. A DOJ spokesperson said they did not immediately have information to share.",
      "The conditions of the prisoner transfer agreement were not immediately clear. But international law experts said it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will shorten their sentences.",
      "Among the three Americans was 21-year-old Marcel Malanga, son of opposition figure Christian Malanga, who led the foiled coup attempt that targeted the presidential palace in Kinshasa. The elder Malanga, who live-streamed from the palace during the attempt, was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Marcel Malanga has said his father forced him to take part.",

Thompson\u2019s stepmother, Miranda Thompson, told the AP that they didn\u2019t have all the details \u201cbut we\u2019re so excited to have him on American soil again.\u201d The Thompsons said they were grateful for all the support they received from the U.S. government, family and friends.",
      "Thompson\u2019s lawyer Skye Lazaro said Tuesday that she had limited information on what his status will be once he lands stateside. She said she plans to pursue all available legal avenues relating to his detention in the U.S.",
      "When the U.S. assumes custody of prisoners convicted abroad, it typically agrees to carry out a sentence of imprisonment designated by that country.",
      "Lawyers for the repatriated Americans could try to get their sentences reduced by arguing they signed their consents to the prisoner transfer treaty under duress, said Jared Genser, a U.S.-based international human rights attorney.",
      "\u201cBut it would be very hard to prevail in such a case as there would be enormous implications for other potential transfers in the future if the U.S. failed to abide by such agreements,\u201d Genser said.",
      "Dozens of others were convicted after the coup attempt, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian. Charges included terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons.",
      "The fate of the others was not immediately clear.",
      "Congo had reinstated the death penalty last year, lifting a more than 2-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks.",
      "Family members last year said the Americans slept on the floor at a high-security military prison in Kinshasa, struggling with health issues and having to pay for food and hygiene products."

      "Paul Chambers, a lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, was first summoned by police last week to hear the charges against him, including violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activity.",
      "Chambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.",
      "The U.S. said that it was \u201calarmed\u201d by Chamber\u2019s arrest and would provide consular assistance.",

      "Chambers reported to the police on Tuesday to formally acknowledge the charges and was then taken to a provincial court for a pretrial detention hearing, according to Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, a legal advocacy group.",

      "The group said another request to allow bail would be filed to an appeals court on Wednesday. No trial date has been set.",
      "The officer who answered the phone at the police station handling the case said he could not comment, and referred the matter to his chief, who did not answer a call to his phone.",
      "It is not unusual for Thai courts to deny bail in cases of insulting the monarchy, popularly known as \u201c112\u201d after its article number in the criminal code.",

      "Thai Lawyers for Human Right said the charges stemmed from the text of the invitation to the October 2024 webinar, titled \u201cThailand\u2019s 2024 Military and Police Reshuffles: What Do They Mean?\u201d and that the charge sheet contained the Thai translation of the invitation\u2019s description of the event.",
      "Napisa also said her husband was not summoned for questioning by police before he was presented with the warrant for his arrest, as is typical in such cases.",
      "\u201cIt just feels like they wanted to deter Paul from doing his work and research, which often touches on topics like the economics of the Thai army,.\u201d she told The Associated Press over the phone.",
      "Thai law envisages 3-15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it is among the harshest such laws anywhere and has also been used to punish critics of the government and the military.",
      "The monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.",
      "However, public debate on the topic has in the past decade grown louder, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020, began openly criticizing the institution. That led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law.",

      "China, which says it has never interfered in the operation of the canal, called Hegseth\u2019s remarks \u201cirresponsible.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe advise the U.S. to reflect on its own bullying and plundering of developing countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including Panama, and stop distorting and slandering China,\u201d a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Panama said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Panama also denies Trump\u2019s accusations about the neutrality of the canal, which is enshrined in its constitution. But to relieve the pressure from Washington, in January it launched an audit of CK Hutchison\u2019s Panama Ports Co. (PPC), which since 1997 has operated two ports along the canal, Balboa on the Pacific side and Crist\u00f3bal on the Atlantic side.",
      "On Monday, Panama\u2019s comptroller general said the audit had found that the contract was overly favorable to Hutchison PPC, costing Panama $1.3 billion in revenue, and that authorities would sue officials involved in its renewal in 2021.",
      "CK Hutchison\u2019s sale to BlackRock includes a 90% interest in the two Panama Canal ports and an 80% controlling interest in 43 other ports outside Hong Kong and China. When the deal was announced March 4, the companies said definitive documentation for the Panama Canal operations would be signed by April 2.",
      "Trump quickly declared victory. \u201cTo further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we\u2019ve already started doing it,\u201d he said in an address to Congress last month, citing the proposed deal.",
      "China\u2019s 'long-arm' jurisdiction",
      "The sale of the two Chinese-run ports is about more than just Panama, said Christopher Hernandez-Roy, senior fellow and deputy director of the Americas Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "\u201cIt represents a major victory for the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to roll back China in the Western Hemisphere,\u201d he said, adding that is something China \u201cwould not want to happen.\u201d",
      "Though CK Hutchison, owned by billionaire Li Ka-shing, is a private company based in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory, Beijing quickly signaled its displeasure with the deal.",
      "China \u201cfirmly opposes using economic coercion and bullying to harm other countries\u2019 legitimate rights and interests,\u201d Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said last week.",
      "Chinese government offices in Hong Kong have reposted articles from pro-Beijing newspapers criticizing the sale as undermining China\u2019s national interest. Beijing\u2019s market regulator has also said the sale is subject to an antitrust review \u201cto protect fair market competition and safeguard public interests.\u201d",
      "The original signing date of April 2 came and went last week."
