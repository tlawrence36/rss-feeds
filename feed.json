      "Daniel Dae Kim is known for roles in spy thrillers and sci-fi epics but he still hopes to play a romantic lead",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

      "KIM: I got so much criticism when I did \u201cLost\u201d that I had to learn how to not take it so personally because it hurt a lot at the time. When I came to Korea when I was 18, cab drivers would give me such a hard time because I couldn\u2019t speak fluent Korean. And they were like, \u201cYou\u2019re Korean, your face is Korean, why don\u2019t you speak Korean?\u201d They had never thought about an immigrant experience from another country. But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy. That\u2019s changing now though. I\u2019m friends with Jimmy O. Yang and, a few years ago, he got to play a romantic lead in a rom-com. And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",

      "\u201cLurker,\u201d a breakout film from the Sundance Film Festival, explores the dark side of celebrity and fandom",
      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",

I think that conversation is really interesting and exciting. But most importantly, I think it\u2019s really exciting to be at the beginning of Alex Russell\u2019s career and to invest into a filmmaker that I think is gonna be making incredible films for a very long time.\u201d",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",
      "Howard assembles an impressive cast, though it isn't always enough to make up for the overambitious plot of a film that drags in the middle.",
      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity. His philosophy spirals into madness throughout the film, reduced to brief, sometimes painful and surface level sound bites that eventually devolve into incoherent ramblings.",

      "Arguably, Sweeney \u2014 who is almost unrecognizable as the timid and brunette Margaret \u2014 steals the show. She easily delivers the most impactful scene of the movie, as she was forced to give birth to a baby boy alone in the middle of the desolate island.",

      "Like in their 2020 comedy \u201cThe Climb,\u201d Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin's \u201cSplitsville\u201d is full of first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts",
      "You can say this: Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin know how to start a movie.",
      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",
      "When an erratic driver careens off the road, they run to check on the passengers. Finding the woman thrown clear of the car, Ashley \u2014 faced with her own mortality \u2014 decides then and there to get a divorce.",
      "In both \u201cThe Climb\u201d and \u201cSplitsville,\u201d these are just the first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts. Their movies \u2014 Covino directs; they write together \u2014 are a little like Wile E. Coyote versions of a rom-com. And part of their considerable appeal is in how much Marvin and Covino are willing to put themselves through the ringer.",
      "Like \u201cThe Climb,\u201d \u201cSplitsville\u201d is a relationship farce that keeps amplifying and recycling. From the scene of the accident, as the credits unspool, Carey trudges seemingly aimless across the countryside. (Splitsville is Nowheresville.) Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",
      "Paul and Carey have a close enough relationship that Paul comes right into the shower to check for ticks on Carey. Later that night, he and Julie casually acknowledge that they have an open marriage. Julie, for instance, could sleep with anyone. Even Carey, they note.",

      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men. Here, just her watchful poise brings a welcome perspective on the mostly male mayhem around her.",
      "The twists and turns of \u201cSplitsville\u201d can grow a little tiresome. Reversals pile on top of each other. But in a movie about infidelity where everyone is lying more to themselves than to their partners, those patterns effectively lead back to where everyone started.",

      "The just over 32-minute, nine-song set will be released Friday, and it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the New Orleans' jazzman's eye-popping wardrobe. The stripped-down, mostly acoustic arrangements create a chill vibe. Simplicity somehow only intensifies the songs\u2019 swing and sway.",
      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
      "Also stellar is \u201cMaybe,\u201d a ballad filled with thick chords and questions about the big picture. \u201cOr maybe we should all just take a collective pause,\u201d Batiste sings, before launching into a keyboard exploration worthy of Jelly Roll Morton.",

The equally buoyant title cut rhymes \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cdummy\u201d in a strummy sing-along that includes backing vocals by the Womack Sisters, granddaughters of soul singer Sam Cooke.",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",
      "\u201cThere have been many stories written about how the \u2018end is near\u2019 in Vegas,\u201d he said. \u201cBut Vegas continues to reinvent itself as a destination worth visiting.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "LONDON -- Terence Stamp, the British actor who often played the role of a complex villain, including that of General Zod in the early Superman films, has died. He was 87.",
      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",
      "The London-born Stamp started his film career with 1962\u2019s seafaring \u201cBilly Budd,\u201d for which he earned Oscar and BAFTA award nominations.",
      "His six decades in the business were peppered with highlights, including his touching portrayal of the transsexual Bernadette in 1994's \u201cThe Adventure of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert,\" the second of his two BAFTA nominations.",
      "But it will be his portrayal of the bearded Zod in 1978's \u201cSuperman\u201d and its sequel \u201cSuperman II\u201d two years later that most people associate with Stamp. As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",
      "Edgar Wright, who directed Stamp in his final feature film, 2021\u2019s \u201cLast Night in Soho,\u201d remembered the actor in an Instagram post as \u201ckind, funny, and endlessly fascinating.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",
      "Bill Duke, who starred with Stamp in director Steven Soderbergh\u2019s 1999 crime drama \u201cThe Limey,\u201d said he was \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d to hear of his death.",
      "\u201cHe brought a rare intensity to the screen, but off-screen he carried himself with warmth, grace, and generosity,\u201d he said on Facebook.",
      "Stamp started his acting career on stage in the late 1950s, where he acted in repertory theatre and met Michael Caine, who was five years older than himself. The pair lived together in a flat in central London while looking for their big break.",
      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "His career took a bit of a hiatus from the late 1960s after he missed out on the role of James Bond to replace Sean Connery, that included a years-long stint in India and which saw him embrace a more holistic approach to his self.",

      "People should listen to the warnings, said Bernie Stewart, a 65-year-old retired bounty hunter in Florida who counts himself lucky to have survived an infection.",
      "In August 2019, Stewart's right leg was infected while he was kayak fishing in Pensacola Bay. What at first appeared to be a sun blister led to three months in the hospital, where doctors performed 10 surgeries to remove decaying skin and prevent the bacteria from killing him.",
      "\u201cThis ain't nothing to play with,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "Vibrio bacteria thrive in seawater and in the mix of fresh and saltwater found in estuaries and lagoons. Most infections are reported from May to October, and most happen in states along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The Gulf\u2019s water is \"the perfect convergence of the right amount of salt and the right amount of heat to let this organism proliferate,\u201d said Dr. Fred Lopez, an infectious diseases specialist at the LSU Health Sciences Center in New Orleans.",

      "As many as 1 in 5 of those infections are fatal \u2014 a much higher rate than other types of Vibrio bacteria.",
      "Some people become infected by eating eat raw or undercooked shellfish \u2014 particularly oysters. But a large percentage fall ill when the person is in ocean or brackish water and the bacteria enter the body through small breaks in the skin.",
      "The antibiotics used to treat food poisoning cases don't work as well when the germ enters through breaks in the skin, Lopez said.",

      "Vibrio vulnificus can enter the body through unhealed cuts and scrapes, recent piercings and tattoos, and recent surgical incisions. If you have such a wound, try to stay out of saltwater or brackish water, and cover it with a waterproof bandage if there\u2019s a chance of exposure.",
      "If you do come in contact with coastal waters or raw seafood, immediately wash cuts and scrapes thoroughly with soap and clean running water, the CDC advises.",

The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",

      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",

      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",
      "Li Shuo, the director of the China Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington, described the plateauing of China's carbon emissions as a turning point in the effort to combat climate change.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Australia\u2019s defense minister and his Philippine counterpart are meeting in Manila on Friday for talks spotlighting their concern over Beijing\u2019s actions in the South China Sea, where Filipino forces were on alert after China deployed a larger number of coast guard forces closer to Manila\u2019s military ship outpost in a fiercely disputed atoll.",
      "Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles is visiting while Australian forces engage in their largest combat exercises with the Philippine military, involving more than 3,600 military personnel in live-fire drills and battle maneuvers. Marles has been invited to witness a mock amphibious beach assault by Australian and Filipino naval forces over the weekend in a western Philippine town facing the South China Sea, Philippine military officials said.",
      "After their meeting, Marles and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. will sign a joint statement of intent to further boost defense cooperation and affirm \u201ctheir resolve to enhance interoperability, collective deterrence and long-term military readiness ... to promote regional security and stability,\" according to Philippine defense officials.",
      "The exercises called Alon, Tagalog for wave, will showcase Australia\u2019s growing firepower. The drills will involve an Australian guided-missile navy destroyer, F/A-18 supersonic fighter jets, a C-130 troop and cargo aircraft, Javelin anti-tank weapons and special forces sniper weapons.",
      "China has raised alarm over such combat exercises in or near the disputed waters, which it claims almost in its entirety, but where the United States and its treaty allies, Australia and the Philippines, have staged joint naval patrols and drills with other countries to boost deterrence against threats to freedom of navigation and overflight.",
      "China\u2019s military have separately confronted U.S., Australian and Philippine ships and aircraft in alarmingly close calls to assert what Beijing calls its sovereignty and sovereign rights in the strategic waterway, a key global trade route, sparking fear of a larger conflict that may involve American forces and their allies in what has long been regarded as an Asian flashpoint.",
      "The large combat drills between Australia and the Philippines, from Aug. 15-29, coincide with a new territorial faceoff between Chinese and Philippine forces in the Second Thomas Shoal. The Philippine navy deliberately grounded a warship in 1999 at the shoal to serve as its territorial outpost. China deployed ships keeping continuous watch at the shoal after Manila refused its demand to withdraw the BRP Sierra Madre.",
      "The Philippine military said Thursday night that China has deployed several coast guard and suspected militia ships, along with a swarm of speedboats, some fitted with high-caliber machine guns and backed by a helicopter and a drone, closer to the grounded warship. A Chinese boat came as close as 50 meters (164 feet) to the Sierra Madre, and two boatloads of Filipino forces were deployed from the ship to prevent the Chinese from coming closer.",
      "Chinese officials did not immediately comment on the Philippine military statement. A Philippine security official said the Chinese actions at Second Thomas shoal were being closely monitored by the U.S. military through aerial surveillance. The Philippine official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.",

      "Rauf initially said that Talabani failed to appear before a judge after being summoned, but later said the operation was carried out \u201csuddenly without informing him about the arrest order.\u201d He confirmed that three members of the local security forces were killed in the raid. The People\u2019s Front said two of its members were also killed.",

      "Iran's foreign minister is planning a call with French, German, and British counterparts to avoid U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Just days away from a European deadline, Iran said Friday its foreign minister would hold a telephone conference call with his French, German and British counterparts to avoid the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "The call, planned for Friday by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, comes as the three parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal threaten to reimpose those sanctions under a mechanism known as \u201csnapback\u201d in the accord. The European Union's chief diplomat will also join the call, IRNA said.",
      "The Europeans' concern over the Iranian program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict's wake. That has left the international community further blinded to Iran's program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Iran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others assess Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
      "In a letter Aug. 8, the three European nations warned Iran it would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d if Tehran didn't reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That deadline would be Aug. 31, in nine days, leaving little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.",
      "Restoring the IAEA's access is a key part of the talks. Iran has blamed the war with Israel in part on the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, without offering any evidence. The IAEA issues quarterly reports on Iran's program and the 2015 deal gave it greater access to keep track of it.",

      "The statue is located about 300 meters (yards) off the beach between the resort towns of Portofino and Camogli, on Italy\u2019s northern Ligurian coast, at a depth of around 18 meters (59 feet).",

      "Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup",
      "BANGKOK -- BANGKOK (AP) \u2014 Thaksin Shinawatra, the billionaire former prime minister of Thailand, remains one of the country\u2019s most influential and controversial figures nearly two decades after being ousted in a 2006 military coup. His political journey, marked by unprecedented popularity, a dramatic fall from power, years in self-imposed exile and a high-profile return, continues to shape Thailand\u2019s political landscape.",
      "His dramatic path took another turn on Friday, defying expectations when a court that has historically leaned against him and his political machine acquitted him of royal defamation, an offense that could have sent him to prison for up to 15 years.",
      "Despite powerful enemies in the Thai establishment and criminal convictions for corruption, he avoided prison by going into exile after his ouster. His return home in August 2023 had seemed to signal an accommodation with his opponents.",
      "However, his insistence on maintaining a high public profile \u2014 he was seen as the real power directing the government, especially when his daughter, Paetongtarn, became prime minister last year \u2014 kept old enmities alive and embroiled him in fresh legal challenges from those wishing to curb his influence.",
      "The Shinawatra family is prominent in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where Thaksin was born to a mercantile family in 1949. After a career in public service as a police colonel, Thaksin became a business entrepreneur in the late 1970s. He built a telecommunications empire starting with Advanced Info Systems, an early mobile phone service provider and the primary source of his fortune.",
      "He entered politics in 1994, holding Cabinet posts before establishing the Thai Rak Thai Party in 1998. Using his fortune to build a nationwide political machine, he promoted populist policies that resonated with lower-income citizens, especially in the countryside.",
      "His platform promised to spread economic growth and bridge the wealth gap, with signature policies including universal healthcare and village development funds. This led to landslide victories for his party in 2001 and 2005, making him the first elected Thai prime minister to complete a four-year term and the country\u2019s longest-serving democratically elected leader.",
      "However, Thaksin\u2019s massive popularity and electoral support rocked Thailand\u2019s established political order. This earned him powerful enemies among conservative forces, including the army and the courts, which saw him as a threat to the monarchy, the bedrock of Thai identity, as well as to their own influence.",
      "He also faced criticism for his imperious CEO-style governance, intolerance of criticism, especially from the media, and failure to distance his business interests from government policy. His administration was also blamed for setting off a persistent Muslim insurgency in Thailand's southern provinces and for what human rights advocates said were more than 2,000 extrajudicial killings during his war on drugs.",
      "His second term was cut short by a military coup in 2006 while he was abroad. Opponents accused him of corruption, abuse of power, and disrespecting then-King Bhumibol Adulyadej, and hounded him with legal cases that he characterized as politically motivated.",
      "Thaksin\u2019s ouster triggered nearly two decades of deep political polarization, pitting his supporters against opponents including better-off urban dwellers, ardent royalists and the military. He briefly returned in 2008 to face charges but skipped bail and fled abroad again, commencing a self-imposed exile lasting over a decade.",
      "Despite his physical absence, Thaksin remained a beloved and influential figure among his followers, whom he encouraged remotely. Parties formed from the ashes of his Thai Rak Thai Party and still under his influence consistently won elections but just as consistently were driven from office by legal challenges in courts hostile to him and destabilizing street protests.",

    "story": [
      "New Zealand's government has announced new military spending of $1.6 billion to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters from the United States",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand 's government announced new military spending Thursday of 2.7 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.6 billion) to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters it plans to purchase from the United States, senior officials said.",
      "Cabinet ministers unveiling the package cited rapidly growing global tensions and a deteriorating security environment. New Zealand\u2019s military spending has trailed that of its larger partners in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group of countries \u2014 which includes the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia \u2014 and the bolstered budget reflects a shift in how the remote island nation is responding to strategic competition among major powers in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\u201cWe face the most challenging strategic circumstances in New Zealand\u2019s modern history and certainly the worst that anyone today working in politics or foreign affairs can remember,\u201d Foreign Minister Winston Peters, who entered Parliament in 1979, told reporters.",
      "The purchase of military planes and helicopters was the first procurement announced in a government plan, disclosed in April, to double defense spending from 1% to 2% of GDP in the next decade.",
      "The package includes five MH-60R Seahawk helicopters to replace the existing maritime fleet and two Airbus A321XLR aircraft, allowing the retirement of Boeing 757s that are more than 30 years old and were already secondhand when purchased. The helicopters accounted for more than NZ $2 billion of the spending, officials said.",
      "Defense Minister Judith Collins said her government would \u201cmove at pace\u201d to procure the helicopters directly through the United States' foreign military sales program instead of going to a wider tender. Cabinet ministers were expected to consider the final business case in 2026, she told reporters in Wellington on Thursday.",
      "It would take \u201ca few years\u201d to acquire the helicopters, Collins added, because buying new meant New Zealand would need to \u201cwait in line.\u201d She denied the choice to buy from the United States was an attempt to rectify the trade imbalance that has seen New Zealand goods targeted for an adjusted 15% levy when arriving in the U.S. under the Trump administration's global tariffs plan.",

      "Collins said she didn't know whether New Zealand's trade minister would seek to use the purchase as leverage when making a case for lower tariffs to U.S. officials. The same helicopters were used by Australia, the U.S. and seven other countries, she said.",
      "The leaders of New Zealand and neighboring Australia this month pledged closer military ties as they are increasingly confronted by great power competition, particularly the rise of China's influence, in the South Pacific Ocean. The region was once neglected by other Western nations, an attitude that has reversed sharply in recent years as the extent of Beijing's attempts to vie for sway with Pacific leaders has become more apparent.",
      "That's proved a challenge for leaders in New Zealand, where use of military ships and aircraft has often been primarily in humanitarian and disaster situations. It has also required a fresh sales pitch on military budgets to a country of 5 million people where the need for defense spending in a remote country with few enemies has traditionally been a difficult sell.",

That's in line with a recent study that documented warming temperatures there and elsewhere around the island as a symptom of climate change.",
      "Across Puerto Rico, an island of 3.2 million people, there have been over 795 emergency room visits for illnesses related to heat exposure since 2023, and 20% of them were by young people aged 18 or younger, according to the health department.",
      "The island government has acknowledged a need for more resilient schools to cope with heat waves, but many schools lack cross-ventilation and have cooling systems that are broken or insufficient.",

      "At Escuela Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn in Yabucoa, in the island's southeast, the school community held raffles and collected a fee for dressing down on casual days to raise money to buy at least one fan for each classroom. Parents often send children to school with their own battery-powered fans to cope with the heat. Teachers have adapted by holding classes in the library, where there is air conditioning, said Josian Casanova, a history teacher at the high school.",
      "Last year, some students felt sick and had to leave because of the heat, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's hard for teachers to focus when it's so hot,\u201d Casanova said. \u201cImagine what it's like for students trying to concentrate.\u201d",
      "At the school in Culebra, the inconsistent power has also affected meal preparation. Changes in voltage have damaged equipment, including the ice machine and ceiling fans, said Mar\u00eda Villanueva, who has worked at the school for five years. The three cafeteria staff members cook meals without a ventilation hood for the stove, and food spoils quickly because of heat and humidity in the storage room.",
      "The heat poses challenges for schools on the U.S. mainland as well.",
      "Over the last decade, demand for air conditioning at the start of the school year in the U.S. has risen 34%, according to an analysis from Climate Central, a science and communications nonprofit that researches climate change. In 2020, the U.S. Government Accountability Office estimated that 41\u202f% of school districts needed to upgrade or replace their heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.",
      "Demand for electricity has risen just as the island has been dealing with an energy crisis. Hurricane Maria in 2017 destroyed the island\u2019s electrical grid. Since the launch of privatization in 2021, electricity customers on average lose power four times a year for a total of about 13 hours.",
      "The island's government has invested more than $15 million since 2021 in air-conditioning equipment for 14 schools, but there isn't always enough power to run them, especially when demand spikes during afternoons in the summer.",
      "Escuela Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn installed air conditioning units this year, but they don't have enough power to turn them all on, Casanova said. The school has been waiting two years for the government to upgrade the building's power substation.",

      "For him and others from impoverished countries across Central Asia who seek better lives in Russia, such hostility is woven into everyday life. Sometimes it bursts into outright violence.",
      "\u201cMostly you notice it when you go to the hospital, a clinic, a government office: You stand in line and everyone shoots you dirty looks,\u201d said the man, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he feared repercussions.",
      "Such xenophobia clashes with economic realities at a time when Russia has a labor shortage, primarily due to its war in Ukraine. In the first quarter of 2025, over 20% of Russian businesses said they were hindered by a lack of workers, according to the Central Bank.",
      "But rather than welcoming laborers, Russian officials are fomenting anti-migrant sentiment and increasing restrictions on immigrants, which the government says number 6.1 million, but is probably higher. The government is tracking their movement, clamping down on their employment and impeding their children\u2019s rights to education.",
      "The continued crackdown comes as a trial began this month for four Tajik nationals who are accused of the shooting and arson attack at a Moscow concert hall in March 2024 that killed 149 people.\u202fThe four were arrested within hours of the attack and appeared in court with signs of being severely beaten. An Islamic State group claimed responsibility but Russia sought to blame Ukraine for the bloodshed.",

But the massacre in particular launched a wave of \u201cterrible violence\u201d against immigrants, said lawyer Valentina Chupik, who has worked with the immigrant community for over 20 years. In the eight days after the killings, she received 700 reports of injuries to immigrants, including \u201cfaces smashed against the doors of police stations,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cThe heinous massacre cannot justify massive rights abuses against Central Asian migrants in Russia,\u201d said its author, Syinat Sultanalieva.",
      "While some violence has subsided, it hasn't disappeared. In April, police raided a Kyrgyz-run bathhouse in Moscow with video showing masked men forcing half-naked bathers to crawl across the floor and deliberately stepping on them before covering the lens of a security camera.",
      "Police also reportedly rounded up immigrants in raids on warehouses, construction sites and mosques, then coerced them into joining the military to fight in Ukraine. Some are threatened with having their residency documents withheld, while others are recently naturalized citizens who failed to register for military service. In such cases, serving in the military is presented as the only alternative to prison or deportation. For others, a fast track to Russian citizenship is offered as an incentive for enlisting.",
      "Speaking in St. Petersburg in May, Alexander Bastrykin, head of Russia\u2019s Investigative Committee, said \u201c20,000 \u2018young\u2019 citizens of Russia, who for some reason do not like living in Uzbekistan, Tajikistan (and) Kyrgyzstan\u201d were serving in Ukraine.",

      "In 2024, 13 Russian regions banned immigrants from certain jobs, including in hospitality, catering and finance, and even as taxi drivers. A pilot program starting in September in the Moscow region requires migrants who enter Russia without a visa to be tracked via an app. Those failing to comply are added to a police watchlist, impeding access to services like banking, and subjecting them to a possible cutoff of cellphone and internet connectivity.",

      "Ukraine's defense industry is gaining global attention for its innovative drone technology",
      "When a Ukrainian-made drone attacked an ammunition depot in Russia last September, it showcased Kyiv\u2019s determination to strike deep behind enemy lines and the prowess of its defense industry.",
      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",
      "\u201cFighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment. We don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.",
      "Terekh spoke as she surveyed dozens of \u201cdeep-strike drones\u201d that had recently come off the assembly line and would soon be used by Ukrainian forces to attack arms depots, oil refineries and other targets vital to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine and economy.",
      "Spurred by its existential fight against Russia \u2014 and limited military assistance from Western allies \u2014 Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation. The goal is to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities \u2014 and Fire Point is one of the companies leading the way.",
      "The Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories. In a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). They also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.",
      "Even as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for an end to the 3 1/2-year war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of U.S. support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.",
      "\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.",
      "Ukraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "That's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.",
      "The company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.",
      "By pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market. Their long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.",
      "When Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.",
      "The FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.",

These strikes have helped to slow Russia\u2019s advance along the 1,000 kilometer-long (620 mile-long) front line in eastern Ukraine, where army units have reported a sharp decline in artillery fire.",
      "\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d",
      "Fire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight. The Ukrainian government incentivized innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.",
      "Patriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones. The ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d",
      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",
      "On the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.",
      "The Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.",
      "The company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said. Because initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.",
      "Fire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.",
      "Even as Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d",

      "Walmart is reporting higher profits and sales as it pulls in shoppers seeking low prices for groceries and other essentials",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Walmart Inc. reported increases in second-quarter profits and sales Thursday as it pulls in shoppers seeking low prices for groceries and other essentials to offset worries that new U.S. tariffs may make a variety of goods more expensive.",
      "The nation\u2019s largest retailer also increased its annual profit and sales outlook. Quarterly results from Walmart and other major U.S. retailers this week offer clues on how consumers are reacting to the possibility of tariff-related price increases.",

      "Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.4 billion.",

      "None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation\u2019s auto dealerships, as signs emerged that President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies were taking a toll on jobs.",

      "On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects. Like Walmart, Home Depot's performance missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations.",
      "The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of additional costs from tariffs, which are taxes on imports.",
      "Target, which has been struggling to reverse a persistent sales malaise, reported another quartely decline in comparable sales and said Wednesday that it would only raise prices as a last resort. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said shoppers are looking for value and so the discounter would focus more on its store label brands, which tend to be less expensive than national labels.",
      "But it\u2019s Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in American retailing. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",

      "WASHINGTON -- With electricity prices rising at more than twice the rate of inflation, President Donald Trump has lashed out at renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power, blaming them for skyrocketing energy costs.",
      "Trump called wind and solar power \u201cTHE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\u201d in a social media post and vowed not to approve wind or \u201cfarmer destroying Solar\u201d projects. \u201cThe days of stupidity are over in the USA!!!\u201d he wrote on his Truth Social site.",
      "Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.",
      "Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans\u2019 electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.",
      "\u201cNow more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,\u201d said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.",
      "The GOP bill will cost thousands of jobs and impose higher energy costs nationwide, Heinrich and other critics said.",
      "A report from Energy Innovation, a non-partisan think tank, found the GOP tax law will increase the average family\u2019s energy bill by $130 annually by 2030. \u201cBy quickly phasing out technology-neutral clean energy tax credits and adding complex material sourcing requirements,\u201d the tax law will \u201csignificantly hamper the development of domestic electricity generation capacity,\u201d the report said.",
      "Renewable advocates were more blunt.",
      "\u201cThe real scam is blaming solar for fossil fuel price spikes,\u201d the Solar Energy Industries Association said in response to Trump's post.",
      "\u201cFarmers, families, and businesses choose solar to save money, preserve land, and escape high costs of the old, dirty fuels being forced on them by this administration,\u201d the group added.",

      "Grassley said he was encouraged by new Treasury guidance that limits tax credits for wind and solar projects but does not eliminate them.

      "Both Wall Street and the White House will be paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s high-profile speech Friday at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just three weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters after the central bank had kept its key interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and said the job market was \u201csolid.\u201d",
      "His assessment was important because if the job market is healthy, there is less need for the Fed to cut its key interest rate, as President Donald Trump has demanded. Two days later, the Labor Department issued a report that cast doubt on that assessment, showing hiring was weak in July and much lower than previously estimated in May and June.",
      "So, there will be a lot of attention paid by Wall Street and the White House to Powell's high-profile speech Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. If the famously data-dependent Powell shifts gears and takes a gloomier view of the job market, that could open the door for a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.",
      "Powell could also stick to the cautious approach he's maintained all year and reiterate that the central bank needs more time to evaluate the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on inflation.",
      "Most economists expect Powell to signal that a rate cut is likely this year, but won\u2019t necessarily commit to one next month. That could disappoint Wall Street, which has put high odds on a September cut.",
      "Powell's speech, his last address at Jackson Hole as chair before his term ends in May, will occur against a particularly fraught backdrop. About a week after the jobs numbers, the latest inflation report showed that price growth crept higher in July. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year ago, above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Stubbornly elevated inflation pushes the Fed in the opposite direction that weak hiring does: It suggests the central bank's short-term rate should stay at its current 4.3%, rather than be cut. That would mean other borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, would stay elevated.",
      "\u201cSo the plot has thickened,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top Fed economist and now director of economic research at Bloomberg Economics and also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense.\u201d",
      "Powell is also navigating an unprecedented level of public criticism by Trump, as well as efforts by the president to take greater control of the Fed, which has long been independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Most observers credit Powell for his nimble handling of the pressures. An iconic moment in his tenure was Trump's visit to tour the Fed's renovation of its office buildings last month. Trump had charged that Powell mismanaged the project, which had ballooned in cost to $2.5 billion, from an earlier estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "With both the president and Fed chair in white hard hats on the building site, in front of cameras, Trump claimed the cost had mushroomed even further to $3.1 trillion. Powell shook his head, so Trump handed him a piece of paper purporting to back up his claim.",
      "Powell calmly dismissed the figure, noting that the $3.1 billion included the cost of renovating a third building five years earlier.",

      "Powell appeared to at least temporarily assuage Trump during the tour, after which the president backed off his threats to fire the Fed chair over the project.",
      "The attacks from Trump are the latest challenges for Powell in an unusually tumultuous eight years as Fed chair. Not long after being appointed by Trump in 2018, Powell endured the president's criticisms as the Fed slowly raised its key rate from the low levels where it had remained for years after the 2008-2009 Great Recession.",
      "Powell then found himself grappling with the pandemic, and after that the worst inflation spike in four decades that occurred as government stimulus checks fueled spending while crippled supply chains left fewer goods available.",
      "Powell then oversaw a rapid series of rate hikes that were widely predicted to cause a recession, but the economy continued plugging ahead.",
      "In his latest attempt to pressure the Fed, on Wednesday Trump called on Fed governor Lisa Cook to step down, after an administration official, Bill Pulte, accused her of mortgage fraud. Pulte is head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.",
      "Cook said in a statement that she wouldn't be \u201cbullied\u201d into resigning and added that she was preparing to answer the charges.",
      "For Powell, there's a difficult decision to make on interest rates. The Fed's \u201cdual mandate\u201d calls for it to keep prices stable while seeking maximum employment. But while the weak jobs data suggest the need for a cut, many Fed officials fear inflation will get worse in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere is still a fair amount that\u2019s still outstanding,\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta branch, said in an interview, referring to tariff-led price hikes. \u201cOne feedback we\u2019ve gotten both in our surveys and from direct conversations (with businesses) suggests that many still are looking to see the price that they charge their customers increase from where we are today.\u201d",
      "Other economists, however, point to the sharp slowdown in housing as a sign of a weak economy. Sales of existing homes fell in June to their lowest level in nine months amid elevated mortgage rates. Consumer spending has also been modest this year, and growth was just 1.2% at an annual rate in the first half of 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to like about the economy right now outside of AI,\" said Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro. \u201cThe weakness in the economy isn't about tariffs,\u201d but instead the Fed's high rates, he added.",

      "In the end, both parties may get what they want.",
      "According to people familiar with negotiations, ESPN is nearing a deal to distribute out-of-market games while NBC/Peacock, Netflix, Apple TV are in talks for regular-season packages, the Wild Card round and Home Run Derby.",
      "All sides hope to have everything finalized by the end of the regular season next month, three people told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been finalized or announced by either side.",
      "The negotiations around the three-year deals is complicated due to the fact that MLB is also trying not to slight two of its other rights holders. MLB receives an average of $729 million from Fox and $470 million from Turner Sports per year under deals which expire after the 2028 season.",
      "While ESPN would be losing the playoffs and Home Run Derby, it would be gaining something it considers more valuable \u2014 the MLB.TV streaming package of out-of-market games as part of the direct-to-consumer service that launched on Thursday. ESPN would also sell the in-market rights to the five teams whose games are produced by MLB \u2014 San Diego, Colorado, Arizona, Cleveland and Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWe are engaged. We are having healthy conversations with them. Nothing to announce today, but we\u2019re very interested in baseball in general,\u201d ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said on Tuesday during a presentation about the network's DTC service.",
      "ESPN, which has carried MLB games since 1990, opted out of the final three years of a seven-year deal in February. The package averaged $550 million per season and also included the Home Run Derby and Wild Card games.",
      "Baseball would be the second league that would have its out-of-market digital package available in the U.S. on ESPN\u2019s platform. The NHL moved its package to ESPN in 2021.",
      "It would also be a win-win situation for MLB and ESPN. Manfred wrote in a memo to owners after ESPN opted out of its contract: \u201cWhile ESPN has stated they would like to continue to have MLB on their platform, particularly in light of the upcoming launch of their DTC product, we do not think its beneficial for us to accept a smaller deal to remain on a shrinking platform. In order to best position MLB to optimize our rights going in to our next deal cycle, we believe it is not prudent to devalue our rights with an existing partner but rather to have our marquee regular season games, Home Run Derby and Wild Card playoff round on a new broadcast and/or streaming platform.\u201d",
      "The moves keep ESPN involved in baseball, but at a point where it can benefit while MLB could benefit from other partners in a short-term deal.",
      "There is a possibility that ESPN would still air 30 regular-season games, but not Sunday nights. That package of games would go to NBC/Peacock, along with the Wild Card round.",

Larger centers can consume up to 5 million gallons (18.9 million liters) a day, according to an article from the Environmental and Energy Study Institute. That's roughly the same as the daily water demand for a town of up to 50,000 people.",

      "Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI\u2019s environmental impact will shrink. That\u2019s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.",

He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing \u201c-ai\u201d so it doesn't provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn't need it.",
      "Loewen has adopted the same approach. She said she tries to organize her thoughts into one AI query instead of asking it a series of iterative questions.

      "His answer there: make use of screen time restrictions on your phone to limit time scrolling on social media. Less time means less personal data collected, less energy and water used, and fewer carbon emissions entering the atmosphere.",

      "President Donald Trump is calling on a Federal Reserve governor to resign over an accusation of mortgage fraud",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump this week called on a Federal Reserve governor to resign over an accusation of mortgage fraud, the latest effort by his administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington.",
      "Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook says she won't leave her post.",
      "Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed\u2019s chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him. Powell, who will speak Friday at an economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, says the Fed wants to see how the economy responds to Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs on imports, which Powell says could push up inflation.",
      "Powell's caution has infuriated Trump, who has demanded the Fed cut borrowing costs to spur the economy and reduce the interest rates the federal government pays on its debt. Trump has also accused Powell of mismanaging the U.S. central bank\u2019s $2.5 billion building renovation project.",
      "Firing the Fed chair or forcing out a governor would threaten the Fed\u2019s venerated independence, which has long been supported by most economists and Wall Street investors. Here's what to know about the Fed:",
      "The Fed wields extensive power over the U.S. economy. By cutting the short-term interest rate it controls \u2014 which it typically does when the economy falters \u2014 the Fed can make borrowing cheaper and encourage more spending, accelerating growth and hiring. When it raises the rate \u2014 which it does to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 it can weaken the economy and cause job losses.",
      "Economists have long preferred independent central banks because they can more easily take unpopular steps to fight inflation, such as raise interest rates, which makes borrowing to buy a home, car, or appliance more expensive.",
      "The importance of an independent Fed was cemented for most economists after the extended inflation spike of the 1970s and early 1980s. Former Fed Chair Arthur Burns has been widely blamed for allowing the painful inflation of that era to accelerate by succumbing to pressure from President Richard Nixon to keep rates low heading into the 1972 election. Nixon feared higher rates would cost him the election, which he won in a landslide.",
      "Paul Volcker was eventually appointed chair of the Fed in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter, and he pushed the Fed's short-term rate to the stunningly high level of nearly 20%. (It is currently 4.3%). The eye-popping rates triggered a sharp recession, pushed unemployment to nearly 11%, and spurred widespread protests.",
      "Yet Volcker didn't flinch. By the mid-1980s, inflation had fallen back into the low single digits. Volcker's willingness to inflict pain on the economy to throttle inflation is seen by most economists as a key example of the value of an independent Fed.",
      "An effort to fire Powell would almost certainly cause stock prices to fall and bond yields to spike higher, pushing up interest rates on government debt and raising borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and credit card debt. The interest rate on the 10-year Treasury is a benchmark for mortgage rates.",

      "Most investors prefer an independent Fed, partly because it typically manages inflation better without being influenced by politics but also because its decisions are more predictable. Fed officials often publicly discuss how they would alter interest rate policies if economic conditions changed.",
      "If the Fed was more swayed by politics, it would be harder for financial markets to anticipate \u2014 or understand \u2014 its decisions.",
      "Fed chairs like Powell are appointed by the president to serve four-year terms, and have to be confirmed by the Senate. The president also appoints the six other members of the Fed's governing board, who can serve staggered terms of up to 14 years.",
      "Those appointments can allow a president over time to significantly alter the Fed's policies. Former president Joe Biden appointed four of the current seven members: Powell, Cook, Philip Jefferson, and Michael Barr. A fifth Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, stepped down unexpectedly on Aug. 1, about five months before the end of her term. Trump has already nominated his top economist, Stephen Miran, as a potential replacement, though he will require Senate approval. Cook's term ends in 2038, so forcing her out would allow Trump to appoint a loyalist sooner.",
      "Trump will be able to replace Powell as Fed chair in May 2026, when Powell\u2019s term expires. Yet 12 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn\u2019t guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",
      "Congress, meanwhile, can set the Fed's goals through legislation. In 1977, for example, Congress gave the Fed a \u201cdual mandate\u201d to keep prices stable and seek maximum employment. The Fed defines stable prices as inflation at 2%.",
      "The 1977 law also requires the Fed chair to testify before the House and Senate twice every year about the economy and interest rate policy.",
      "The Supreme Court earlier this year suggested in a ruling on other independent agencies that a president can't fire the chair of the Fed just because he doesn't like the chair's policy choices. But he may be able to remove him \u201cfor cause,\u201d typically interpreted to mean some kind of wrongdoing or negligence.",
      "It's a likely reason the Trump administration has zeroed in on the building renovation, in hopes it could provide a \u201cfor cause\u201d pretext. Still, Powell would likely fight any attempt to remove him, and the case could wind up at the Supreme Court.",

      "Clark previously missed time with two different muscle injuries, and the Fever didn't give in then, either. Clark injured her left quad in May, then missed the WNBA's Commissioner's Cup title game in July because of an injured left groin. The Fever still beat Minnesota 74-59.",

      "The Milwaukee Brewers are preparing to spend this weekend honoring Hall of Fame broadcaster Bob Uecker",
      "MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee Brewers fans offer a supernatural explanation for their team\u2019s surprising surge to the top of the major league standings.",
      "And they believe it can continue carrying them all the way through October as the Brewers seek to win their first World Series title.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s Uecker magic,\u201d said Bonnie Bruhn, a 79-year-old Brewers fan from the Milwaukee suburb of West Allis, Wisconsin.",
      "As the Brewers prepare to spend this weekend honoring Hall of Fame broadcaster Bob Uecker, fans are hoping the team can pay tribute to him by making the deep playoff run that has eluded this franchise lately.",
      "Uecker, who died Jan. 16 at the age of 90 after fighting small cell lung cancer, had broadcast Brewers games for 54 years. He remained loyal to his hometown team even after his chats with Johnny Carson and appearances in beer commercials and the \u201cMajor League\u201d movies made him a national celebrity.",
      "The Brewers are holding a celebration of life for the man nicknamed \u201cMr. Baseball\u201d before their Sunday afternoon game with the San Francisco Giants. The pregame ceremony will be hosted by Bob Costas, Uecker\u2019s longtime broadcast partner on NBC national telecasts.",
      "There already has been plenty for Brewers fans to celebrate this season, as they own the best record in the major leagues and hold a seven-game lead over the Chicago Cubs in the NL Central.",
      "Milwaukee didn\u2019t send a single position player to the All-Star Game, yet the Brewers entered Thursday ranked second in the majors in runs scored thanks to a lineup with a tenacious approach that has manager Pat Murphy comparing his players to woodpeckers because they \u201ckeep pecking away.\u201d",
      "Rookie third baseman Caleb Durbin used a different comparison this week.",
      "\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re sharks out there,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cWe smell blood. Once we get runners on and start scraping those first couple runs across, we want that big inning.\u201d",
      "The Brewers (80-48) could go just .500 the rest of the season and would still end up with the best record in franchise history. They were 25-28 and 6 \u00bd games behind the Cubs on May 24, but they\u2019re 55-20 since.",
      "That surge includes a franchise-record 14-game winning streak that had some strange coincidences.",
      "Milwaukee scored 12 runs in its 12th straight win. The Brewers extended the streak to 13 when Christian Yelich used a special Uecker-themed bat in a game for the first time and homered twice in a victory over Cincinnati. The Brewers\u2019 14th straight win featured a go-ahead homer in the 11th inning from light-hitting utilityman Andruw Monasterio, who happens to wear No. 14.",
      "Bruhn noted a couple of those examples Wednesday as she talked Brewers baseball while waiting in line to get her free hamburger from George Webb, a local fast-food chain that gives away burgers whenever Milwaukee wins at least 12 straight games. Bruhn also explained just how much faith she has in this year\u2019s team.",
      "After the Brewers\u2019 last 12-game winning streak in 2018, Bruhn said she got her free burger from George Webb but kept it in the freezer \u201cin a little baggie just to remind us it would happen again.\u201d",
      "\u201c'Til a week ago we threw them away, because we knew that we were going to get fresh hamburgers,\u201d Bruhn said. \u201cIt was just a sign that we trusted the team to win 12 in a row.\u201d",

      "Yelich noted the random nature of postseason baseball and said the Brewers\u2019 playoff history is pretty irrelevant because there\u2019s so much turnover from year to year. Yelich and pitcher Brandon Woodruff are the only players remaining from that 2018 team.",
      "\u201cEach team has just as good of a chance as winning the World Series as losing in the first round every year,\u201d Yelich said. \u201cIt\u2019s baseball.

      "Christian McCaffrey has been a standout at the San Francisco 49ers' training camp, remaining healthy after missing most of last season because of injuries",
      "SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- In a training camp that has seemed to feature a new injury almost every day for the San Francisco 49ers, the one positive on the injury front has been the health of Christian McCaffrey.",
      "After missing almost all of last season with injuries to his Achilles tendon and knee, McCaffrey has been one of the few running backs or receivers to make it through the first five weeks of practice without an injury.",
      "While he has gotten some scheduled rest days, McCaffrey has been a near constant on the field and once again looks like the player who transformed the 49ers offense after arriving in a midseason trade in 2022.",
      "\u201cYou all have eyes like I do, Christian looks fantastic,\u201d star left tackle Trent Williams said Thursday. \u201cHe looks like Offense Player of the Year Christian. So that\u2019s really, really refreshing to see, knowing what he had to deal with last year, just the little nicks and knacks and not being able to do what he loves. To see him out there this year 100% healthy, treating every play like it\u2019s his last, playing with his hair on fire. It really motivates the guys when you got a generational talent that brings it to work and to practice every day.\u201d",
      "It's a far cry from last season when McCaffrey injured his Achilles tendon early in training camp and missed the first eight games of the season. He rushed for just 202 yards on 50 carries in four games before going down with a season-ending knee injury as he was unable to match his sensational 2023 season.",
      "McCaffrey won the AP Offensive Player of the Year that season after leading the NFL with 2,023 yards from scrimmage and tying for the league lead with 21 touchdowns.",
      "McCaffrey had missed just one game combined in 2022-23 \u2014 a meaningless Week 18 game in the 2023 season for San Francisco when he had a sore calf \u2014 after missing 23 games because of injuries in his final two full seasons with Carolina.",
      "Coach Kyle Shanahan joked last week that McCaffrey had hit 25 mph on his GPS readings in practice. But no matter what speed McCaffrey has reached, he is looking much healthier than he did a year ago when he missed almost all of training camp.",
      "\u201cObviously physically he looks great, getting in and out of cuts, running hard. Back to the McCaffrey that we all know,\u201d quarterback Brock Purdy said. \u201cAnd then mentally he\u2019s just, he\u2019s on one, like he\u2019s ready to get after it with the season and obviously from beginning to end, like play a whole season and go hard. That\u2019s who he is. He keeps telling all of us in the locker room, he\u2019s like, \u2018Dude, I can\u2019t wait. I can\u2019t wait.\u2019\u201d",
      "Receiver Skyy Moore passed a physical, completing a trade that sent him to San Francisco from Kansas City. The Niners sent a sixth-round pick in 2027 to the Chiefs for Moore and a 2027 seventh-rounder.",
      "Moore gives San Francisco a healthy body at receiver with so many other players hurt or facing a suspension to start the season such as Demarcus Robinson. General manager John Lynch said on his radio show on flagship station KNBR on Thursday that Russell Gage was the latest Niners receiver to get hurt with a knee injury that will likely sideline him for a week or two.",

      "The Niners also made a swap at backup quarterback with the team re-signing Tanner Mordecai after cutting him earlier this month and releasing Nate Sudfeld after two practices. Mordecai should get time in the exhibition finale on Saturday against the Chargers.",
      "Cornerback Tre Brown was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. Brown was signed in March to be in the mix at either slot or outside cornerback after spending four seasons with Seattle. But he fell down the depth chart early in camp and now is shut down with an undisclosed injury.",

      "Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori defended their U.S. Open mixed doubles title Wednesday night, keeping a traditional team on top of a revamped event filled with singles stars",
      "NEW YORK -- Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori weren't even sure they would get to defend their U.S. Open mixed doubles title. Organizers revamped the tournament because they wanted singles superstars, not doubles specialists.",
      "They not only made it back to New York, they made it back to the top.",
      "The Italians beat No. 3 seeds Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7 (10-6) on Wednesday night, winning four matches over two days to earn $1 million\u2014 a huge raise over their earnings in New York last year in a format that looked nothing like this one.",
      "Errani and Vavassori were among the many critics of the changes to the event that shut out every other traditional doubles pairing, but had nothing but smiles \u2014 and plenty of hugs \u2014 after building a quick lead in the match tiebreaker and holding on in front of a large crowd inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.",
      "\u201cI think it was important for us to play,\u201d Vavassori said. \u201cLike, I have to say the initiative was also important because it was really a statement that doubles can become something better. The stadium was packed. The people were enjoying it. If something doesn\u2019t work \u2014 like, we showed today that it\u2019s working. Like, the people were going crazy.\u201d",
      "It was a setting rarely enjoyed by doubles players and what U.S. Open organizers sought when they overhauled their tournament, moving it to well before singles play starts Sunday in hopes that tennis' best-known players would play.",
      "Many of them did. But in the end, the event belonged to the doubles duo.",
      "Eight teams in the 16-team field qualified by their players\u2019 combined singles rankings, with the remaining teams given wild cards. Errani doubted the Italians were going to get one.",
      "They eventually did and became the first repeat mixed doubles champions in Flushing Meadows since Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jamie Murray in 2018-19. Both repeatedly said they were representing the many doubles players who never had the chance to come to New York with them this year.",
      "\u201cI think this one is also for them,\u201d Errani said.",
      "The event drew past U.S. Open singles champions Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka and Daniil Medvedev, all of whom lost on the first day. Even without them, almost all the seats were full for the three matches Wednesday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, with the roof closed after it rained most of the afternoon.",

But even players who specialize in doubles agreed that the event got way more attention than they are accustomed to.",
      "\u201cAny time you get a full crowd like this, how can we keep that going?\u201d Christian Harrison said after he and Danielle Collins lost 4-2, 4-2 to Errani and Vavassori in the semis. \u201cI mean, unreal night. I won\u2019t forget this night.\u201d",

    "summary": "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "As part of its effort to investigate Smartmatic's work in Los Angeles, Fox has sued to force LA County Clerk Dean Logan to hand over public records about his dealings with Smartmatic's U.S. affiliate.",
      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration",
      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",
      "Huang did not comment directly on the tax when asked but said Nvidia appreciated being able to sell H20s to China.",
      "He said such sales pose no security risk for the United States. Nvidia is also speaking with Beijing to reassure Chinese authorities that those chips do not pose a \u201cbackdoor\u201d security risk, Huang said.",
      "\u201cWe have made very clear and put to rest that H20 has no security backdoors. There are no such things. There never has. And so hopefully the response that we\u2019ve given to the Chinese government will be sufficient,\u201d he said.",

      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours. French media reported the broadcast was interrupted soon after Pormanove\u2019s co-streamers found him unconscious and lying on a bed.",
      "Damien Martinelli, the prosecutor in the southern French city, said in a statement that the autopsy carried out on Thursday showed the death was not caused by a trauma and \u201cnot related\" to the intervention of any third party. Some additional medical and toxicological analyses have been ordered, he said.",
      "Pormanove's death came as a judicial investigation was already underway into alleged violence and humiliations committed against him, prompted by reports from French investigative website Mediapart about what it described as the \u201conline abuse business.\u201d Mediapart said co-streamers were allegedly mistreating Pormanove in live broadcasts, sometimes encouraged by payments from viewers, to generate more subscriptions and money.",
      "The investigation, opened in December, is looking into \u201cdeliberate violence against vulnerable persons\u201d and \u201cspreading recordings of images related to offenses involving deliberate violations of physical integrity,\" Martinelli's statement said.

      "The statement said two co-streamers allegedly involved in the case were briefly taken into custody in January but were released pending further investigation.",

      "Interpol has announced that a major cybercrime crackdown has led to the arrest of 1,209 suspects across Africa",
      "DAKAR, Senegal -- A major cybercrime crackdown coordinated by Interpol has led to the arrest of 1,209 suspects across Africa and the recovery of nearly $97.4 million, the organization announced Friday.",
      "Dubbed Operation Serengeti 2.0, the operation took place between June and August. It brought together investigators from 18 African countries and the United Kingdom to fight harmful cybercrimes including inheritance scams, ransomware and business email compromise.",
      "Altogether, the scams targeted nearly 88,000 victims, the international police organization said in a statement.",
      "Interpol said that authorities in Angola dismantled 25 cryptocurrency mining centers where 60 Chinese nationals had been mining cryptocurrency. The operation resulted in the confiscation of equipment worth over $37 million; the government now plans to use the equipment to support power distribution in vulnerable areas.",
      "In Zambia, the operation dismantled an online investment scheme that defrauded more than 65,000 victims of an estimated $300 million through a fraudulent high-return cryptocurrency scam.",
      "\u201cThe scammers lured victims into investing in cryptocurrency through extensive advertising campaigns promising high-yield returns. Victims were then instructed to download multiple apps to participate,\u201d Interpol said. It said that 15 people had been arrested and that authorities seized evidence including domains, mobile numbers and bank accounts.",
      "In locating the scam center in Zambia, authorities also disrupted a suspected human trafficking network, Interpol said.",

      "China has released new interim measures to tighten controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets",
      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",
      "They require companies to comply with quotas for various minerals. Companies must have government approval to deal with rare earths and must accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled. Violators will face legal penalties and also have their quotas for rare earths reduced.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "Those limits raised worries that manufacturers in the U.S. and elsewhere would run short of vital materials needed for production, an issue in China-U.S. trade talks. In response to U.S. concessions on access to computer chip design software and jet engines, Beijing announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports.",
      "In July, China\u2019s Ministry of State Security said it was cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it said threatened national security, indicating Beijing was moving to exert more control.",
      "Over the past several decades, China has come to dominate rare earths processing. It now supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, even though it mines only about 70% of such materials.",
      "China holds nearly half of the world's known reserves of rare earths, but it also imports significant amounts of rare earths from neighboring Myanmar for processing and export.",
      "Since it controls technologies used for refining rare earth elements and has banned exporting that know-how, China holds a near-monopoly on smelting and separating them.",

      "In 2024, the United States obtained 70% of the rare earths it used from China; 13% from Malaysia; 6% from Japan and 5% from Estonia. Some of the elements obtained from non-Chinese intermediate sources came from mineral concentrates processed in China and Australia, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey.",
      "China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply.",
      "The rules released Friday spell out tighter controls on licensing of companies dealing in rare earths and centralize controls on mining, exports and processing. They also impose more stringent environmental standards for the industry.",
      "Trump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths, while pushing for Beijing to ease its controls.",
      "China has opted to dial up or down the approval process as needed, while tightening overall controls on the industry.",
      "The new regulations don't spell out the quotas for production and export or specific rare earths elements, but strongly suggest Beijing is serious about exerting stronger control over the industry.",

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "\u201cThey could focus more on teaching,\u201d Gazmararian said. \u201cThere were just not the disruptions.\u201d",
      "Another benefit: More positive interactions among students. \u201cThey were saying that kids are talking to each other in the hallways and in the cafeteria,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the classroom, there is a noticeably lower amount of discipline referrals.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.",
      "Researchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups \u2014 Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.",
      "Key studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN\u2019s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.",
      "Naming different giraffes matters because \u201ceach species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.\u201d",
      "Northern giraffes \u2014 whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.",
      "Considering four giraffe species \u201cis absolutely the right decision, and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis.",
      "While in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes\u2019 spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.",
      "What appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.",
      "Over the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.",

      "The stadium complex is the only professional sports venue certified by a group that's trying to preserve the night sky around the world. Across North America and Canada, schools and local parks have also swapped out their lights on baseball fields, running tracks and other recreation grounds to preserve their view of the stars and protect local wildlife.",
      "Night lights can disrupt bird migration and confuse nocturnal critters like frogs and fireflies. Lights on sports fields are especially bright and cool, and often cast their glare into neighborhoods.",
      "In renovations over the past decade, the U.S. Tennis Association swapped metal halide bulbs for shielded LED lights. The complex\u2019s 17 tournament courts \u2014 including Arthur Ashe Stadium \u2014 and five practice courts were approved as dark sky-friendly last year.",
      "USTA officials wanted the best lighting possible on their courts, which also happened to be friendly to dark skies. Their lighting company suggested striking a balance that would satisfy crowds and TV crews while cutting down spillover into the surrounding environment.",
      "\u201cThis is an international event that has an impact on the community,\u201d said the USTA\u2019s managing director of capital projects and engineering Chuck Jettmar. \u201cLet's minimize that and make sure that everybody's happy with it.\u201d",

      "The lights at Flushing Meadows glow at a quarter of their brightness when the courts are rented for play during the year. They're approved by DarkSky International, a nonprofit that gives similar designations to cities and national parks. The group widened its focus to include sports arenas in recent years and has certified over 30 venues since 2019 \u2014 including high school football fields and youth soccer fields.",
      "\u201cWe live in a world where we need to engage with one another in the nighttime environment, and that\u2019s OK,\u201d said DarkSky spokesperson Drew Reagan. \u201cThat\u2019s a beautiful thing and there\u2019s a way to do that responsibly.\u201d",
      "The organization typically approves proposals at sports fields before any light fixtures are installed or replaced. Once construction is complete, a representative measures the glow and glare against a set of guidelines that benefit the night.",
      "Renovating a field with dark skies in mind can cost about 5% to 10% more than traditional sports lighting, according to James Brigagliano, who runs DarkSky\u2019s outdoor sports lighting program. Venues may require a few extra fixtures since the light shining from them is more targeted.",
      "Most arenas make the change during scheduled maintenance and renovation, working with sports lighting company Musco. The company lights over 3,000 venues a year including college football stadiums, tennis courts and rail yards.",

    "story": [
      "A medical museum in Philadelphia is redrawing its policies about collecting and displaying human remains",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- A medical museum in Philadelphia has redrawn its policies on the collection and display of human remains, limiting its acceptance of additional specimens and working to follow \u201cevolving modern medical ethical standards\u201d in how it handles the 6,500 organs, bones and other body parts in its collection.",
      "The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, which owns the Mutter Museum, announced this week it is restricting the taking of photos and videos of human remains, allowing it only with the museum\u2019s permission. Photography by the public will remain prohibited.",
      "The museum \u201cwill allow photography as long as it sort of serves an educational purpose,\u201d said Sara Ray, its director of interpretation and engagement. \u201cBut education itself is a pretty broad net that we're working through.\u201d",
      "The great majority of the remains were collected from about 1840 to about 1940, mostly from Philadelphia, largely body parts and organs that were considered to be helpful in medical education and taken during autopsies or surgery. Such collections were not uncommon among medical societies at a time when specimens were critical to understanding how the body is structured and how it works. But most of those museums are long gone.",
      "The Mutter Museum said it is also working to \u201cde-anonymize\u201d its collection by looking into the personal histories of its human remains to figure out who they are, if possible, and to \u201cdo justice\u201d in how it displays them and tells their stories. The goal is to exhibit them in the context of the history of medicine, bodily diversity and the tools and therapies used to treat them.",
      "Museum researchers are using a variety of records to piece together those histories, focusing on where and when the remains were collected, but they are not employing DNA analysis. In some cases, the museum has information about the person that was recorded by the physician who collected the specimen.",
      "\u201cThe goal is not finding an identity for finding an identity\u2019s sake,\u201d Ray said. \u201cThe goal is to find an identity so that we can build a richer biographical profile, through which we can then ask questions about the way that this person navigated the world. And so that\u2019s going to look very different for every single specimen.\u201d",
      "The museum's new human remains policy says that many were \u201cobtained in unacceptable circumstances including through force or duress\u201d and may have been used for research or in displays that are now considered to be examples of scientific racism.",
      "About 50 of its specimens are thought to be of Native American people. Since April 2024, nine remains have been repatriated to two tribes and one Native Hawaiian group.",
      "The remains will not be loaned out to other institutions, and research access to them must be approved by a group consisting of several top museum leaders. Research involving the collection tends to be about the history of medicine, not for purely biological study.",
      "The policy changes follow a two-year review, designed to engage the public in planning for the museum's future. As a result, hundreds of the museum\u2019s videos regarding items in the collection and on educational topics that were removed from YouTube in January 2023 are being restored to the streaming service after being reorganized, with out-of-date material removed.",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "\u201cThis lawsuit is based on misleading and inaccurate claims that fail to recognize the robust safety measures TikTok has voluntarily implemented to support the well-being of our community,\" company spokesperson Nathaniel Brown said in a statement. \"Teen accounts on TikTok come with 50+ features and settings designed to help young people safely express themselves, discover and learn.",
      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

      "Google, in contrast, has been steadily increasing the amount of AI that it began to implant on its Pixels since 2023, with this year\u2019s models taking it to another level.",
      "Taking advantage of a more advanced processor, Google is introducing a new AI feature on the Pixel 10 phones called \u201cMagic Cue\u201d that\u2019s designed to serve as a digital mind reader that automatically fetches information stored on the devices and displays the data at the time it\u2019s needed. For instance, if a Pixel 10 user is calling up an airline, Magic Cue is supposed to instantaneously recognize the phone number and display the flight information if it\u2019s in Gmail or a Google Calendar.",
      "The Pixel 10 phones will also come with a preview feature of a new AI tool called \u201cCamera Coach\u201d that will automatically suggest the best framing and lighting angle as the lens is being aimed at a subject.

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for the media giant Meta says a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, should be thrown out",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed by families of the Uvalde school shooting victims alleging Instagram allowed gun manufacturers to promote firearms to minors should be thrown out, lawyers for Meta, Instagram's parent company, argued Tuesday.",
      "Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "The families sued Meta in Los Angeles in May 2024, saying the social media platform failed to enforce its own rules forbidding firearms advertisements aimed at minors. The families, who were present at last month's hearing, did not appear in court, with a lawyer citing the back-to-school season. Many plaintiffs attended the hearing virtually, he said.",
      "In one ad posted on Instagram, the Georgia-based gunmaker Daniel Defense shows Santa Claus holding an assault rifle. In another post by the same company, a rifle leans against a refrigerator, with the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s normalize kitchen Daniels. What Daniels do you use to protect your kitchen and home?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges those posts are marketed toward minors. The Uvalde gunman opened an online account with Daniel Defense before his 18th birthday and purchased the rifle as soon as he could, according to the lawsuit. He also owned various Instagram accounts and had an \u201cobsessive relationship\u201d with the platform, at times opening the app more than 100 times a day, plaintiffs' lawyers found in an analysis of the shooter's phone.",
      "Meta attorney Kristin Linsley argued that the families provided no proof that minors, including the Uvalde gunman, even read the Daniel Defense posts on Instagram. She also said the posts didn't violate Meta\u2019s policies because they weren\u2019t direct advertisements and did not include links to purchase any products.",
      "Katie Mesner-Hage, representing the victims' families, said the defense\u2019s claim is \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d as the plaintiffs don\u2019t have access to Meta data that would indicate whether the shooter encountered those posts. She added that if the content had landed on the shooter\u2019s feed, as the plaintiffs allege, then Meta \u201cnot only knew about it, they designed the system so it would be delivered to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey knew more about him than anyone else on the planet,\u201d she said.",
      "Linsley said content advertising firearms for sale on Instagram is allowed if posted by \u201cbrick-and-motor and online retailers,\u201d but visibility of those posts was restricted for minors under Meta\u2019s advertising policies from the end of 2021 to October 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is not a playbook for how to violate the rules. This is actually what the rules are,\u201d Linsley said.",
      "The plaintiff\u2019s team, however, showed a fake profile they created for a 17-year-old boy earlier this month, through which they were able to search Daniel Defense\u2019s Instagram account and see a post that included a picture of a gun, as well as a link to the gun manufacturer\u2019s website.",
      "When the link was clicked, the gun-maker\u2019s website opened, and the team was able to select a firearm and add it to their cart, all within Instagram\u2019s app \u2014 an experiment that refutes Meta\u2019s assertion that posts relating to firearms aren\u2019t visible to users under 21, Mesner-Hage said.",

      "The families have also sued Daniel Defense and video game company Activision, which produces \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d",
      "Linsley said the Communications Decency Act allows social media platforms to moderate content without being treated as publishers of that content.",
      "\"The only response a company can have is to not have these kinds of rules at all,\" Linsley said. \u201cIt just gets you down a rabbit hole very quickly.\u201d",
      "Mesner-Hage argued Meta is not protected by the act because social media platforms don\u2019t just host speech, but help curate it through its algorithms. Daniel Defense, she said, didn't have to pay for ads to get free access to Meta's analytical data through its business account on Instagram. That data shows the company which age bracket and gender engaged most with a specific post.",
      "\u201cDaniel Defense is not on Instagram to make friends. ... They\u2019re on there to promote their product,\u201d Mesner-Hage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paid advertisement, but I would struggle to describe this as anything other than an advertisement.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that firearm companies tweaked their online marketing to comply with Meta's policies, including by avoiding the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d and not providing links to purchase, and that the social media company did not protect users against such strategies.",
      "Last month, lawyers for Activision also argued that legal proceedings against them should be thrown out, saying the families allegations are barred by the First Amendment. The families alleged that the war-themed video game Call of Duty trained and conditioned the Uvalde gunman to orchestrate his attack.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs asked the judge to allow them to amend their lawsuit with the new information they presented Tuesday before ruling on the defense\u2019s motion. The defense claimed that was unnecessary, as the case would not have merit even with the amendments.",
      "The judge has yet to rule on Activision's motion and did not immediately rule on the Meta case.",

      "Regent Craft is testing a new type of winged passenger ferry on Narragansett Bay",
      "NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. -- The winged passenger ferry gliding over the surface of Narragansett Bay could be a new method of coastal transportation or a new kind of warship.",
      "Its maker, Regent Craft, is betting on both.",
      "Twelve quietly buzzing propellers line the 65-foot (20-meter) wingspan of Paladin, a sleek ship with an airplane's nose. It looks nothing like the sailboats and fishing trawlers it speeds past through New England's largest estuary.",
      "\u201cWe had this vision five years ago for a seaglider \u2014 something that is as fast as an aircraft and as easy to drive as a boat,\u201d said CEO Billy Thalheimer, jubilant after an hours-long test run of the new vessel.",
      "On a cloudy August morning, Thalheimer sat in the Paladin's cockpit and, for the first time, took control of his company's prototype craft to test its hydrofoils. The electric-powered watercraft has three modes \u2014 float, foil and fly.",
      "From the dock, it sets off like any motorized boat. Farther away from land, it rises up on hydrofoils \u2014 the same kind used by sailing ships that compete in America\u2019s Cup. The foils enable it to travel more than 50 miles per hour \u2014 and about a person's height \u2014 above the bay.",
      "What makes this vessel so unusual is that it's designed to soar about 30 feet (10 meters) above the water at up to 180 miles per hour \u2014 a feat that hasn't quite happened yet, with the first trial flights off Rhode Island's seacoast planned for the end of summer or early fall.",
      "If successful, the Paladin will coast on a cushion of air over Rhode Island Sound, lifting with the same \u201cground effect\u201d that pelicans, cormorants and other birds use to conserve energy as they swiftly glide over the sea. It could zoom to New York City \u2014 which takes at least three hours by train and longer on traffic-clogged freeways \u2014 in just an hour.",
      "As it works to prove its seaworthiness to the U.S. Coast Guard and other regulators around the world, Regent is already lining up future customers for commercial ferry routes around Florida, Hawaii, Japan and the Persian Gulf.",
      "Regent is also working with the U.S. Marines to repurpose the same vessels for island-hopping troops in the Pacific. Those vessels would likely trade electric battery power for jet fuel to cover longer journeys.",
      "With backing from influential investors including Peter Thiel and Mark Cuban, Thalheimer says he\u2019s trying to use new technology to revive the \u201ccomfort and refined nature\u201d of 1930s-era flying boats that were popular in aviation\u2019s golden age before they were eclipsed by commercial airlines.",
      "This time, Thalheimer added, they're safer, quieter and emission-free.",
      "\u201cI thought they made travel easier in a way that made total sense to me,\u201d Cuban said by email this week. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to travel around water for short distances. It\u2019s expensive and a hassle. Regent can solve this problem and make that travel fun, easy and efficient.\u201d",
      "Co-founders and friends Thalheimer, a skilled sailor, and chief technology officer Mike Klinker, who grew up lobster fishing, met while both were freshmen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later worked together at Boeing. They started Regent in 2020.",
      "They've already tested and flown a smaller model. But the much bigger, 12-passenger Paladin \u2014 prototype of a product line called Viceroy \u2014 began foil testing this summer after years of engineering research and development. A manufacturing facility is under construction nearby, with the vessels set to carry passengers by 2027.",
      "The International Maritime Organization classifies \u201cwing-in-ground-effect\u201d vehicles such as Regent's as ships, not aircraft. But a database of civilian ships kept by the London-based organization lists only six around the world, all of them built before it issued new safety guidance on such craft in 2018 following revisions sought by China, France and Russia.",

      "The IMO says it treats them as marine vessels because they operate in the vicinity of other watercraft and must use the same rules for avoiding collisions. The Coast Guard takes a similar approach.",
      "\u201cYou drive it like a boat,\u201d Thalheimer said. \u201cIf there\u2019s any traffic on the harbor, you\u2019ll see it on the screen. If you see a boat, you\u2019d go around it. We\u2019re never flying over boats or anything like that.\u201d",
      "One of the biggest technical challenges in Regent's design is the shift from foiling to flying. Hydrofoils are fast for a seafaring vessel, but far slower than the speeds needed to lift a conventional airplane from a runway.",
      "That's where air blown by the 12 propellers comes in, effectively tricking the wing into generating high lift at low speeds.",
      "All of this has worked perfectly on the computer simulations at Regent's headquarters in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The next step is testing it over the water.",
      "For decades, the only warship known to mimic such a ground-effect design was the Soviet Union's hulking ekranoplan, which was built to fly under radar detection but never widely used. Recently, however, social media images of an apparent Chinese military ekranoplan have caught the attention of naval experts amid increasingly tense international disputes in the South China Sea.",
      "Regent has capitalized on those concerns, pitching its gliders to the U.S. government as a new method for carrying troops and cargo across island chains in the Indo-Pacific region. It could also do clandestine intelligence collection, anti-submarine warfare and be a \u201cmothership\u201d for small drones, autonomous watercraft or medical evacuations, said Tom Huntley, head of Regent's government relations and defense division.",
      "They fly below radar and above sonar, which makes them \u201creally hard to see,\u201d Huntley said.",
      "While the U.S. military has shown increasing interest, questions remain about their detectability, as well as their stability in various sea states and wind conditions, and their \"cost at scale beyond a few prototypes and maintainability,\u201d said retired U.S. Navy Capt. Paul S. Schmitt, an associate research professor at the Naval War College, across the bay in Newport, Rhode Island.",
      "Schmitt, who has seen Paladin from afar while sailing, said he also has questions about what kind of military mission would fit Regent's \u201crelatively short range and small transport capacity.\"",
      "The possibilities that most excite Cuban and other Regent backers are commercial.",
      "Driving Interstate 95 through all the cities that span Florida's Atlantic Coast can take the better part of a day, which is one reason why Regent is pitching Miami as a hub for its coastal ferry trips.",
      "The Viceroy seagliders can already carry more passengers than the typical seaplane or helicopter, but a growing number of electric hydrofoil startups, such as Sweden's Candela and California-based Navier, are trying to stake out ferry routes around the world.",
      "Thalheimer sees his vehicles as more of a complement than a competitor to electric hydrofoils that can't travel as fast, since they will all use the same docks and charging infrastructure but could specialize in different trip lengths.",

      "LONDON -- Britain abandoned its demand that Apple provide so-called backdoor access to any encrypted user data stored in the cloud, U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said Monday.",
      "Gabbard indicated London and Washington had resolved their high-stakes dispute over electronic privacy, writing on X that she and President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance spent the \u201cpast few months\u201d working with the U.K. government.",
      "\u201cAs a result, the UK agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a \u2018back door\u2019 that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties,\u201d she said.",
      "The dispute surfaced at the start of the year with a news report that British security officials had issued the U.S. tech giant with a secret order requiring the creation of backdoor access to view fully encrypted material.",
      "Apple challenged the order, which raised fears of electronic spying by national security officials.",
      "The British government reportedly served Apple with what is known as a \u201ctechnical capability notice\u201d ordering it to provide the access under a sweeping law called the Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which has been dubbed the snoopers\u2019 charter.",
      "The U.K. Home Office did not respond directly to Gabbard's statement, saying it \u201cdoes not comment on operational matters, including confirming or denying the existence of such notices.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have long had joint security and intelligence arrangements with the US to tackle the most serious threats such as terrorism and child sexual abuse, including the role played by fast-moving technology in enabling those threats,\" the office said. \"We will always take all actions necessary at the domestic level to keep UK citizens safe.\u201d",

    "summary": "Ghislaine Maxwell said she never witnessed any inappropriate activity by Donald Trump or Bill Clinton, according to a transcript of her meeting last month with the DOJ.",
    "story": [
      "Maxwell met with a top DOJ official for a two-day interview session last month.",
      "The woman thought to have the most direct knowledge of  Jeffrey Epstein's decades-long sex-trafficking operation claims there was no client list, no blackmail scheme and -- to her knowledge -- no high-profile Epstein associates who committed illicit acts in connection with the notorious sex-offender's crimes.",
      "That's according to an account provided by Epstein's convicted co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell to a top official of the U.S. Department of Justice during a highly unusual two-day interview session last month, according to a transcript and audio of the conversation released Friday by the DOJ.",
      "\"There is no list,\" Maxwell told Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche. \"I'm not aware of any blackmail. I never heard that. I never saw it, and I never imagined it.\"",
      "Maxwell told Blanche that during her time with Epstein -- which ranged from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s -- she never witnessed nor heard of any inappropriate or criminal activity by President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton, nor any of the well-known men who associated with Epstein, according to the transcript.",
      "Trump, Maxwell said, was cordial and a \"gentleman in all respects\" in all of her interactions with him. She described Clinton as a \"truly extraordinary\" man and a \"fantastic ex-president,\" according to the transcript of the meetings, which took place at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Tallahassee, Florida.",
      "The 63-year old Maxwell, who has been incarcerated since her arrest in 2020, also claimed she had been misidentified by a key witness at her criminal trial and insisted she was not involved in the sexual exploitation of minors.",
      "\"I did introduce him to women. I did, but not underage women,\" she said. \"And I did look for masseuses, I did. I went to spas and if I met somebody who said she was a masseuse, I did not check their credentials.\"",
      "Blanche -- who previously served as a personal defense attorney to President Donald Trump -- announced his intention to speak with Maxwell in a social media post last month, as the Trump administration sought to quell the self-inflicted controversy surrounding its decision not to release the government's investigative files on Epstein, after repeatedly promising to do so.",
      "The Department of Justice -- in an unsigned memo released last month explaining its decision -- said that a \"systematic review\" revealed no incriminating client list and no evidence \"that could predicate an investigation into uncharged third parties.\"",
      "Maxwell was granted limited immunity for the interview with Blanche -- meaning nothing she said could be used against her, unless she lied. She and her attorneys signed the agreement at the outset of each day of the interview session, the transcript shows.",
      "Maxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence for aiding and participating in Epstein's trafficking of underage girls, which involved a scheme to recruit young women and girls for massages of Epstein that turned sexual. Federal prosecutors in New York said Maxwell helped Epstein recruit, groom and ultimately abuse girls as young as 14.",
      "Despite her conviction at trial in 2021 -- where she declined to take the witness stand -- Maxwell claimed in her interview with Blanche that she had been wrongly accused and did not receive a fair trial. She maintained, as she had done previously in a 2016 deposition in a civil case, that she never recruited anyone underage to massage Epstein and never witnessed or participated in any criminal acts, according to the transcript.",
      "\"I have no memory ... of having seen anybody that resembles a young child, let's call it what it is, at that house giving him a massage at all,\" Maxwell said, in reference to Epstein's Palm Beach home.",
      "\"I saw him with a lot of masseuses. I never saw a single masseuse ever look unhappy or not come back or whatever,\" Maxwell said. \"So any time I saw anybody with him, they were happy to be with him.\"",
      "Maxwell was indicted in July 2020, during the first Trump administration. Her trial occurred in late 2021, while President Joe Biden was in the White House.",
      "Federal prosecutors charged Maxwell with perjury for alleged lies she told during the 2016 deposition. And the government repeatedly assailed her credibility during her criminal case, citing her \"willingness to lie brazenly under oath about her conduct,\" according to court records.",
      "The perjury counts against her were eventually dropped after her conviction on the more serious charges.",
      "Blanche's meeting with Maxwell came just days after the Justice Department fired Maurene Comey, a federal prosecutor in New York with the most detailed knowledge of the case. Comey, the daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, led the criminal prosecution of Maxwell.",
      "The tone of the conversation appeared cordial and non-confrontational, a review of the transcript shows, with Blanche frequently allowing space for Maxwell's lengthy critiques of the accounts of her accusers.",
      "\"I don't want you to be burdened,\" Blanche told Maxwell a few hours into the interview. \"I want you to just tell the truth the best you can. So I don't want you to be burdened by what people said at trial or what, you know, the press says about you.\"",
      "Blanche -- the top deputy to U.S. Attorney General Pamela Bondi --indicated that the goal of the Maxwell meeting was to determine if she had \"information about anyone who has committed crimes against victims,\" according to a July 22 statement posted to social media by the DOJ.",
      "According to sources familiar with internal deliberations that preceded the meeting with Maxwell, Blanche was encouraged by some top administration officials to seek information that could lead to criminal investigations that might quiet the outrage from some of Trump's most vocal supporters.",
      "\"The FBI and the DOJ will hear what she has to say,\" Blanche wrote in the post. \"Until now, no administration on behalf of the Department had inquired about her willingness to meet with the government. That changes now.\"",
      "The transcript confirms previous ABC News reporting that it was Maxwell's legal team that initiated the request for the meeting.",
      "\"That's true and I did speak to [my lawyer] ... and did tell him that I would be very keen to talk to anyone because no one from the government at any time ever ... since the inception of the case, so dating back to the early 2000s, has ever spoken to me, and I, indeed, I believe ever reached out to me at any time to even speak to me,\" Maxwell said.",
      "Maxwell appealed her conviction but her attempts have thus far been unsuccessful. She now has a pending application before the U.S. Supreme Court to review her conviction. Her lawyers have stated that they have not yet asked President Trump to commute her sentence or to pardon her, but that Maxwell \"would welcome any relief.\"",
      "Blanche was accompanied by an FBI agent and another DOJ official and Maxwell was with three of her attorneys, according to the transcript.",
      "The unusual meeting involving the nation's second-ranking law enforcement official and a convicted sex-trafficker evoked a strong response from some victims of Epstein and Maxwell.",
      "Annie Farmer, one of the witnesses who testified for the prosecution at Maxwell's trial, told a federal court last week that she and other victims \"unequivocally object to any potential leniency that the government may be considering for Maxwell.\"",
      "During nine hours of questioning over two days, Maxwell was quizzed by Blanche about dozens of famous people -- politicians, business titans and Hollywood stars -- who had previously been named as having associated with Epstein. The inquiries started broadly -- with Blanche asking if Maxwell or Epstein knew the people -- before asking if any of the high profile figures had done anything improper. And in each instance, Maxwell indicated that she had never witnessed nor heard about any alleged wrongdoing, the transcript shows",
      "Maxwell's attorney, David Markus, told reporters after the meetings concluded that his client had been asked by Blanche about \"one hundred different people.\"",

      "Among those Blanche inquired about, according to the transcript, were tech billionaires Bill Gates, Reid Hoffman and Elon Musk; political figures Ehud Barak, Robert Kennedy Jr. and the late U.S. Senator George Mitchell; and celebrities Kevin Spacey, Chris Tucker and Naomi Campbell.",
      "The rumored existence of an apocryphal \"Epstein client list\" has long fueled speculation of a \"deep state\" cover-up to protect an elite cabal of alleged participants in Epstein's crimes. Some of the most vocal purveyors of the theory -- including FBI Director Kash Patel and his top deputy Dan Bongino -- have since taken up prominent posts in the Trump administration.",
      "But Maxwell said there was no such list and that she saw no indication that Epstein had obtained compromising information that he used to extort others.",
      "\"A man wants sexual favors, he will find that. They didn't have to come to Epstein for that,\" Maxwell said.",
      "\"[T]here's no list. There never was a list,\" she said. \"None that I ever heard of, none that I ever witnessed.\"",
      "At one point in the interview, Maxwell likened the quest to find others complicit in Epstein's crimes to a dark period in early American history.",
      "\"So that narrative that was created and then built upon, and it just mushroomed into what -- basically this is like a Salem witch trial. People go and lost [sic] their minds for this thing,\" she said. \"I mean, it's bananas.\"",
      "Significant portions of the interview were dedicated to inquiries about President Trump and ex-President Bill Clinton.",
      "Before any allegations of sexual misconduct against Epstein surfaced in 2005, Trump and Clinton each spoke glowingly of Epstein, and court records have included documents and testimony indicating that -- at separate times -- both men flew with Epstein on his private jets.",
      "Clinton's association with Epstein was first noted publicly in 2002, after reporters learned of the former president's journey that year on Epstein's jet for a humanitarian mission to multiple African nations. Clinton told New York magazine through a spokesman at the time that \"Jeffrey is both a highly successful financier and a committed philanthropist with a keen sense of global markets and an in-depth knowledge of twenty-first-century science.\"",
      "In that same article, Trump boasted of his friendship with Epstein, saying, \"I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy.\"",
      "\"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life,\" Trump told the magazine.",
      "Maxwell told Blanche she had a friendship with former President Clinton after being introduced by a mutual acquaintance, she said.",
      "\"President Clinton was my friend, not Epstein's friend,\" she said. \"President Clinton liked me, and we got along terribly well. But I never saw that warmth with Mr. Epstein.\"",
      "Maxwell said she had suggested to Epstein that he allow Clinton to use his private jumbo-jet to fly to multiple international destinations in Africa, Asia and Europe in the early 2000's, after the end of his presidency. Clinton, Maxwell said, had no particular interest in Epstein other than having the use of his plane.",
      "\"They met because of me and the plane was because of me,\" she said. \"I didn't see President Clinton being interested in Epstein. He was just a rich guy with the plane.\"",
      "Despite President Trump's oft-repeated claims that Clinton had traveled more than 20 times to Little St. James -- Epstein's private U.S. Virgin Islands estate where much of Epstein's abuse is alleged to have occurred -- Maxwell said the former president had never been there and wouldn't have wanted to go, because he had no relationship with Epstein.",
      "\"He never, absolutely never went. And I can be sure of that because there's no way he would have gone. I don't believe there's any way that he would've gone to the island had I not been there. Because I don't believe he had an independent friendship, if you will, with Epstein,\" Maxwell told Blanche.",
      "Bill Clinton has previously said through a spokesperson that he \"knew nothing\" about Epstein's crimes, had never visited the island, and that all the flights on Epstein's aircraft in 2002 and 2003 were associated with work for the Clinton Foundation.",
      "As for the current president, Maxwell said that she first knew of Trump through her late father, who purchased the New York Daily News in 1991. She said she only saw Trump and Epstein, both native New Yorkers, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.",
      "\"I may have met Donald Trump at that time because my father was very friendly with him and liked him very much,\" Maxwell said. \"And I think, [it] should be said that he also very much liked [Trump's first wife] Ivana because she was also from Czechoslovakia where my dad was from.\"",
      "Maxwell said she only saw the two native New Yorkers, Trump and Epstein, together in social settings and never saw or heard anything inappropriate about Trump while he was with Epstein.",
      "\"I don't know how they met, and I don't know how they became friends. I certainly saw them together and I remember the few times I observed them together. But they were friendly. I mean, they seemed friendly,\" Maxwell said.",
      "And at a time when her legal team has publicly signaled her hopes for a reprieve from the president, Maxwell expressed admiration for Trump.",
      "\"And as far as I am concerned, President Trump was always very cordial and very kind to me. And I just want to say that I find -- I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming president now. And I like him. And I've always liked him,\" she said.",
      "\"And did you ever hear Mr. Epstein or anybody say that President Trump had done anything inappropriate with masseuses or with anybody in your world? Blanche asked.",
      "\"Absolutely never, in any context,\" Maxwell replied.",
      "Published reports in the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal last month indicated that the decision not to release the Epstein files came after President Trump was informed in May that his name was among those that appeared multiple times in the documents. The president has denied that he was told his name appeared in the files.",
      "The appearance of a name in the Epstein files is not evidence of illicit activity.",
      "President Trump has said he ended his association with Epstein before any allegations of sexual abuse were raised in Florida in the mid 2000s.",
      "Trump said in 2019, after Epstein's arrest for child sex trafficking, that he hadn't spoken to him in 15 years. More recently, the president has claimed he split with Epstein after discovering Epstein was allegedly poaching employees from the spa at Mar-a-Lago, the president's private club in Palm Beach.",
      "Maxwell was escorted from her prison cell in Tallahassee to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the two days of meetings with Blanche. A week later, she was transferred to a minimum-security federal prison camp for women in Texas, with no official explanation for the move.",
      "Maxwell is the Oxford-educated daughter of Robert Maxwell, the larger-than-life publishing baron whose rags-to-riches story captivated England. She lived an extravagant life among the British elite until her father's business empire collapsed in the wake of his death in 1991. She relocated to New York looking for a fresh start and was soon seen in the company of the mysterious multimillionaire Epstein.",
      "Epstein was arrested in July 2019 and charged in a federal indictment with conspiracy and child sex trafficking. He died in custody a month later, while awaiting trial. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.",

      "James Dobson, who founded the conservative ministry Focus on the Family and was long a campaigner against abortion and gay rights, has died",
      "James Dobson, a child psychologist who founded the conservative ministry Focus on the Family and was a politically influential campaigner against abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, died on Thursday. He was 89.",
      "His death was confirmed by the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute.",
      "Born in 1936 in Shreveport, Louisiana, Dobson started a radio show counseling Christians on how to be good parents and in 1977 founded Focus on the Family. At its peak, the organization had more than 1,000 employees and gave Dobson a platform to weigh in on legislation and serve as an adviser to five presidents.",
      "He became a force in the 1980s for pushing conservative Christian ideals in American politics alongside fundamentalist giants like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. He campaigned for bringing religious conservatives into the political mainstream, and in 1989, Falwell called Dobson a rising star. Decades later, he served on a board of evangelical leaders that advised President Donald Trump in 2016. He supported Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns.",
      "He celebrated the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade \u2014 including Trump\u2019s conservative appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court credited with the landmark decision that allowed states to ban abortion.",

      "Dobson left Focus on the Family in 2010 and founded the institute that bears his name. He continued with the Family Talk radio show, which is nationally syndicated and is carried by 1,500 radio outlets with more than half a million listeners weekly, according to the institute.",
      "\u201cDr. Dobson\u2019s impact endures through the many lives he touched, the families he strengthened, and the unshakable faith he proclaimed,\u201d his family said in a statement announcing his death.",
      "Gary Bauer, a senior vice president at Dobson\u2019s institute, called him a \u201cpioneer\u201d who helped families in a world of shifting values. Dobson interviewed President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1985, thanking him for concentrating on issues important to families.",
      "Dobson's radio program promoted guests who said they abandoned their homosexuality and instead embraced Christianity.",
      "Dobson was not just an influential voice that helped lead the rise of the Christian, conservative movement to today, where such a large portion of Republican voters consider themselves evangelical conservatives. He was also mentor to today\u2019s leading Christian conservative voices.",
      "Dobson, as a board member on Family Research Council, approached Tony Perkins, then a Louisiana state legislator, to become president of the organization. That was after Perkins grew up in his family church, watching Dobson\u2019s films and following his lead with his own work in the Louisiana Legislature.",
      "In Perkins\u2019 first week as president, he and Dobson stood on the steps of the Alabama Supreme Court to support the installation of a monument to the Ten Commandments in the building. The action led to a court case and the monument\u2019s removal.",
      "Dobson belongs on the \u201cMount Rushmore\u201d of the Christian conservatives, Perkins said, notably for leading an evangelical church-driven counter-movement to a family and parenting ethos of the 1960s embodied in the progressive teachings of Dr. Benjamin Spock.",

      "Federal safety investigators and some members of Congress want to expand special safety rules that apply to trains carrying flammable material to many more trains, saying the risk to many U.S. communities is far greater than currently known",
      "When a BNSF freight train carrying six cars of liquefied petroleum gas derailed near Manuelito, New Mexico, in 2024, the resulting fire shut down more than 100 miles of an interstate highway.",
      "The train carried enough flammable material to send a column of fire and black smoke high into the thin, dry air \u2014 but not enough to qualify as a \u201chigh-hazard flammable train\u201d under federal rules.",
      "That meant the train was not obligated to follow federal safety rules that require high-hazard flammable trains, or HHFTs, to operate at slower speeds, and use safer braking systems and tank cars.",
      "It also meant BNSF was not obligated to include the train in federally-mandated reports to New Mexico emergency management officials estimating the movement of HHFTs through the state.",
      "Federal safety investigators and some lawmakers want to change that. For more than a decade, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major train accidents, has tried and failed to convince federal regulators to make HHFT safety rules apply to a much larger number of trains. In an investigation report on the Manuelito disaster released in June, the NTSB again called for changes.",
      "The current definition of an HHFT only covers trains carrying large quantities of flammable liquids, such as crude oil or alcohol. The safety board wants to expand the definition to include liquefied petroleum gas and other flammable gases.",
      "The issue generated intense interest from lawmakers following the catastrophic derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that caught fire, resulting in the release of a toxic plume of vinyl chloride \u2014 a flammable gas \u2014 over East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. The train wasn\u2019t classified as an HHFT, even though it was carrying three loaded tank cars of flammable liquid. That\u2019s because the federal definition requires a train to carry at least 35 loaded cars of flammable liquid \u2014 or at least 20 cars in a row \u2013 to qualify.",
      "In the wake of that accident, some members of Congress filed legislation that overlaps with the NTSB recommendation and goes one step further. The DERAIL Act, introduced by Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., would define an HHFT as one carrying even a single car of a flammable gas or a flammable liquid.",
      "\u201cI think what we saw in the East Palestine derailment is a pretty blunt reality that even just a single train carrying something flammable and toxic \u2014 say, like vinyl chloride \u2014 can cause a lot of harm to people who live near the tracks,\u201d said Deluzio, whose Pennsylvania district sits just across the border from East Palestine.",
      "The bill stalled in the House after being introduced in 2023, but Deluzio reintroduced it in January. Supporters say the legislation, which has not moved in Congress, could provide U.S. communities with a more accurate picture of risk from train derailments.",
      "That\u2019s because there are many more trains carrying small amounts of flammable material than there are trains carrying large amounts, according to a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of data that details the precise movement of freight trains.",
      "Federal transportation officials have recognized rail as the \u201csafest land-based method of moving large quantities of chemicals over long distances\u201d when compared with movement on trucks.",
      "The Association of American Railroads \u2014 an industry lobbyist and trade group with significant sway over rail safety practices \u2014 \u201chas concerns with a number of the provisions in (the DERAIL Act) and similar bills,\u201d spokesperson Jessica Kahanek said. The industry follows its own protocol that limits the speed of trains carrying more than 20 cars of hazardous material, she noted.",
      "The association is open to discussing the HHFT definition, but changes \u201cmust be driven by an assessment of actual risk,\u201d Kahanek said, and must allow railroads \u201cto continue safely delivering the goods Americans depend on each day.\u201d",
      "Railroads closely protect real-time and location-specific information about the movement of freight trains carrying hazardous materials, saying public disclosure presents a public safety risk.",
      "To analyze the potential impact of the proposed change to the definition of HHFTs, the Howard Center relied on data from RailState LLC, a company that independently captures detailed information on train movements.",
      "The company has placed optical sensors on private land at key locations across the North American rail network. The sensors take pictures of each passing train. They use artificial intelligence to extract information about the cargo, identifying hazardous materials by reading warning placards displayed on rail cars.",
      "The firm sells its information to government agencies in the U.S. and Canada, as well as to shippers and other clients.",
      "Only the railroads \u2014 and not the U.S. government \u2014 know the precise number and real-time location of HHFTs. It\u2019s not possible, even with RailState\u2019s data, to precisely compare the number of trains that meet the current definition to the number of HHFTs that would meet the proposed definition.",
      "One major reason: both definitions only consider loaded tank cars, and RailState\u2019s data cannot automatically determine whether a tank car is loaded \u2014 or only contains chemical residue.",
      "What is clear from the RailState data, however, is that there are many more trains with a smaller number of cars with hazmat placards indicating the presence of a flammable gas or a flammable/combustible liquid than there are trains carrying a large number of cars with placards for a flammable/combustible liquid.",

      "NEW YORK -- A ban on assault weapons that Connecticut put in place after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is constitutional, a federal appeals court said Friday, as it rejected challenges by gun rights advocates who claim it violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said public interest favors allowing the ban.",
      "The appeals court said the Second Amendment lets legislators implement targeted regulations designed to protect residents and their children from experiencing tragedies like the Dec. 14, 2012, shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives.",
      "The ruling came at an early stage for two lawsuits brought by individuals and gun rights groups. It upheld a Connecticut judge's ruling that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that they would win their challenge to block enforcement of the laws while the lawsuits proceed.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump's administration has been pushing for the death penalty, but judges are blocking attempts to reverse previous decisions against capital punishment",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- President Donald Trump's administration is faltering in its aggressive pursuit of the death penalty as it revisits cases in which predecessors explicitly decided against seeking capital punishment.",
      "Since taking office in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which President Joe Biden's administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently on Monday in a pair of cases in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing the limits of the Trump administration's power to undo decisions in cases already well underway.",
      "In pursuing capital punishment, the Justice Department is seeking to follow through on a Trump campaign promise to resume federal executions after they were halted by Biden\u2019s Attorney General Merrick Garland. The Republican president's Justice Department has accused the previous Democratic administration of supplanting \u201cthe will of the people with their own personal beliefs\u201d in failing to seek death sentences in many cases involving horrific crimes.",
      "Detailed opinions haven't been issued in the most recent two cases, which involve a man accused of killing a police officer in 2022 and two men accused of armed robbery and murder in 2018. But other judges who have rejected reversal attempts on constitutional and procedural grounds were blunt in their assessment of the Trump administration\u2019s approach.",
      "\u201cThe government has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important constitutional and statutory rights,\" Trump appointee U.S. Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two teenage girls in 2020. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Authorization of capital prosecution typically occurs years before trial, but in the Maryland case, prosecutors filed the death penalty notice less than four months before the trial was scheduled to start. None of the defendants were represented by attorneys who specialize in death penalty litigation, which they would have been entitled to under federal law due to the complexity of capital cases and the potential consequences.",
      "\u201cThe government does not hide the ball here \u2014 the only reason for its flip-flop on the death penalty was the change in administration,\u201d wrote Gallagher, who called the government\u2019s \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to the differences between capital and non-capital trials \u201cstartling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis court will not cast aside decades of law, professional standards, and norms to accommodate the government\u2019s pursuit of its agenda,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOf course, elections have consequences, and this administration is entitled to pursue the death penalty in cases where it can do so in accordance with constitutional and statutory requirements. But this is not one of them.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors in Maryland and in a Nevada case declined to comment, but in court documents they argued that the Justice Department has an \u201cinherent power\u201d to reconsider previous decisions and that the timing of the death notice was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d given that the defendants had years to prepare for trial.",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General has simply reconsidered an earlier decision, which it is her prerogative to do so, and exercising that inherent authority is not misconduct but basic management and governance,\u201d wrote Maryland\u2019s U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes. \u201cAt no point did the Government make an enforceable promise. Deciding not to seek certain charges is not a promise not to do so.\u201d",
      "Trump, whose first administration carried out a record-setting 13 federal executions, signed an order on his first day back in the White House compelling the Justice Department to seek the death penalty in appropriate federal cases and support capital punishment in states. Bondi, who has said she will seek the death penalty \u201cwhenever possible,\u201d quickly lifted a Biden-era moratorium on federal executions and ordered a review of decisions made by the previous administration.",

The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity under terms set by the department, said roughly 1,400 decisions not to seek the death penalty were issued by Garland, with all but 459 having already been fully adjudicated by the time Trump took office.",
      "Bondi isn\u2019t the first attorney general to review past cases: Not only did Garland authorize just one death penalty case during his tenure, he also withdrew 35 notices of intent to seek the death penalty issued by his predecessors. The Justice Department says the Bondi-ordered review was essentially \u201cthe flip side\u201d of Garland's action and was the right thing to do to ensure consistency and achieve justice for victims and their families.",
      "But Robin Maher, executive of the Death Penalty Information Center, said while the Biden administration\u2019s actions reflected declining public support for the death penalty, Trump has brushed that aside.",
      "\u201cSo his enthusiasm for use of the death penalty is different not only from President Biden\u2019s more cautious approach, it\u2019s different from every other president\u2019s approach in history,\u201d said Maher, whose organization doesn\u2019t take a position on capital punishment but is critical of how it is used.",
      "Whether the reversals will stand remains a question in two of the cases. In the others, courts have sided with defendants who said they reasonably relied on assurances made by the previous administration. In court documents, lawyers for some of the defendants said they would have pursued plea bargains or objected to postponing trial dates had they known the death penalty decision would be reversed.",
      "\u201cIn some of these cases, very different paths were taken when those assurances were given,\u201d Maher said.",
      "In Nevada, prosecutors notified Cory Spurlock of their intention to seek the death penalty just 12 days before he was set to go on trial for the 2021 deaths of a California couple. Striking down that notice in May, Judge Miranda Du said the government fell far short of justifying its \u201cwholesale reversal at the eleventh hour.\u201d The trial began this week after prosecutors withdrew their appeal of her ruling.",
      "\u201cThe government decided \u2014 certainly not by inadvertence or accident \u2014 to reverse course on an issue of critical importance, involving Spurlock\u2019s life, less than two weeks before trial, with full knowledge that the reversal would have a chaotic impact on the progression of this case and would make it impossible to proceed to trial on the scheduled date,\u201d wrote Du, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. \u201cUnder the circumstances, this is certainly tantamount to playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with the Court\u2019s orders in particular and the judicial process in general.\u201d",

      "The former Trump national security adviser whose home and office are being searched by federal agents has been a vocal critic of the Republican president",
      "John Bolton, whose home and office were searched by federal agents on Friday, has been one of the most vocal critics of President Donald Trump since serving as a national security adviser in Trump's first administration.",
      "After serving in the White House, Bolton wrote a scathing book that portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy. FBI agents' searches of Bolton\u2019s Maryland home and Washington office, purportedly part of an investigation into the handling of classified information, raise the question of possible future actions against critics of the Republican president who have voiced their opinions.",
      "Bolton was not detained and has not been charged with any crimes, a person not authorized to discuss the investigation by name told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.",
      "Here's more information on Bolton, a Republican and foreign policy hawk:",
      "Bolton served as Trump\u2019s third national security adviser, appointed in 2018 after Trump dismissed H.R. McMaster.",
      "Bolton's 17-month tenure was rife with clashes over countries including North Korea and Iran, with him voicing skepticism over Trump's outreach toward and summit with Kim Jong Un. On Iran, Bolton backed Trump's decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal but favored regime change and was frustrated when Trump called off a planned military strike in 2019.",
      "Those rifts ultimately led to Bolton's departure, with Trump announcing on social media in September 2019 that he had accepted Bolton's resignation.",
      "Bolton's 2020 book, \u201cThe Room Where It Happened,\u201d painted an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid first-person account at the time of how Trump conducts himself in office. The 577-page book portrayed Trump as grossly ill-informed about foreign policy, with Bolton writing that the president \u201csaw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.\u201d",
      "Bolton wrote that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week \u201cand in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.\u201d",
      "On Ukraine, Bolton alleged that Trump directly tied providing military aid to the country\u2019s willingness to conduct investigations into Joe Biden, soon-to-be Trump's Democratic 2020 election rival, and members of his family. In one conversation, Trump said \u201che wasn\u2019t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,\u201d Bolton wrote.",
      "Bolton also wrote that he felt \u201chard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by re-election calculations,\" noting how Trump \u201cpleaded\u201d with China\u2019s Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his reelection prospects.",
      "Trump responded by slamming Bolton as a \u201cwashed-up guy\u201d and a \u201ccrazy\u201d war-monger who would have led the country into \u201cWorld War Six.\u201d Trump also said at the time that the book contained \u201chighly classified information\" and that Bolton \u201cdid not have approval\u201d for publishing it.",
      "The White House worked furiously to block the book, unsuccessfully asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order against its release.",
      "In an interview that aired Wednesday on NPR, Bolton said little has changed in bringing an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine, pointing to Trump\u2019s efforts to secure a Nobel Peace Prize as the president's motivation to end the conflict.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no indication at all that Russia has in any way changed its objective, which is to bring Ukraine into the greater Russian Empire,\u201d Bolton said. \u201cNor is there any real sign that Zelenskyy is prepared to do the sorts of things that Russia has demanded of President Trump, such as ceding a substantial part of the Donetsk Oblast or province, which the Russians have not yet been able to conquer militarily.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Bolton posted to X that \u201cPutin\u2019s KGB training and flattery campaign is working Trump over, as seen by Trump\u2019s statement recently about how Ukraine shouldn\u2019t have taken the war on. It\u2019s important to remember: Ukraine didn\u2019t take anything on, they were invaded.\u201d",

      "During the transition period following his 2016 election, Trump reportedly ruled out choosing Bolton to serve as secretary of state in part because he disliked his signature bushy mustache. Following a meeting with Bolton at Trump Tower, Trump told confidants that the hawk\u2019s trademark mustache would never be a fit in his administration, although he kept an admiring eye on Bolton\u2019s frequent cable TV appearances, during which he often defended the policies of the president even when they ran counter to what he had preached for decades.",
      "According to Bolton's 2019 book, however, the president told him that his facial hair \u201cwas never a factor\" in appointing him to any position.",
      "When George W. Bush became president, Bolton served as the State Department\u2019s point man on arms control, where he battled other governments on nuclear weapons tests, land mines, biological weapons, ballistic missile limits and the International Criminal Court.",
      "An unabashed proponent of American power and a strong supporter of the Iraq war, Bolton was unable to win Senate confirmation after his nomination to the U.N. post turned off many Democrats and even some Republicans. He resigned after serving 17 months as a Bush recess appointment, which allowed him to hold the job on a temporary basis without Senate confirmation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has dropped an investigation into a buy now, pay later company with close ties to President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr., saying the investigation was conducted in a biased manner and based off politics.",
      "The CFPB on Tuesday notified Credova Financial, a subsidiary of Public Square Holdings, where Trump Jr. is a board member and investor, that it was no longer under investigation. Public Square is a directory of businesses that sell American-made products, including financing for firearms and family pets, that market to conservative-leaning customers. Credova provides buy now, pay later services to Trump Jr.\u2019s GrabAGun firearms marketplace, which went public this year.",
      "The agency says the investigation, initiated during Democrat Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, was politically motivated against firearms companies and Trump Jr. However, the company has a record of dozens if not hundreds of consumer complaints and settlements over state consumer protection violations.",
      "The closure of the investigation also comes when the CFPB, a watchdog agency that helps oversee the nation\u2019s banks and financial services companies, has been undoing rulemaking, dropping other cases and ending law enforcement work that was done under previous administrations, including Trump's first term.",
      "The CFPB in Trump's second term determined the Credova investigation \u201cexemplifies the type of weaponization against disfavored industries and individuals\" that Trump and the agency's acting director, Russell Vought, are committed to ending, according to a letter sent to the chief counsel of Public Square Holdings. The CFPB during Biden's term ratcheted up settlement demands on the company the day Trump Jr. joined Public Square's board of directors, the letter said.",
      "Former CFPB employees, from during Biden's term, declined to speak about the decision, saying they're not permitted to discuss investigations.",
      "Michael Seifert, chairman and CEO of Public Square, said in a statement that the closure of the CFPB investigation \u201cconfirms the strength and integrity of our company and validates the trust our merchants and consumers place in us\u201d and is \u201da win for our entire company, our board, our customers, and a 2nd Amendment community that has seen years of government attempts to regulate businesses like ours out of existence.\"",
      "However, the firm had for years been accused of charging junk fees to customers or violating state consumer protection rules.",
      "In 2021, Credova and another Nevada-based finance firm reached a settlement with the Massachusetts attorney general's office to waive balances totaling more than $126,000 to resolve allegations they illegally leased dogs in violation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act.",
      "In January 2024, Credova and the California Department of Financial Protection and Innovation entered into a consent order to resolve allegations the firm failed to disclose potential third-party fees to consumers. As a result, Credova was required to pay a $50,000 penalty and disclose potential third-party convenience fees to consumers in the future.",
      "There have also been more than 50 consumer complaints filed against Credova to the CFPB, a search of the database shows. Many of the complaints relate to debt collection practices.",

The transition has proven fragile, with renewed violence erupting in March along the coast  and in July in Sweida, a city with a significant Druze population, highlighting the continued threat to peace after years of civil war.",
      "Clashes erupted in Sweida on July 13 between Druze militias and local Sunni Muslim Bedouin tribes, and government forces intervened, nominally to restore order but they ended up essentially siding with the Bedouins. Israel intervened in defense of the Druze, launching dozens of airstrikes on convoys of government fighters.",
      "Pedersen said in a video briefing to the council that although the July 19 ceasefire agreement has largely held, \u201cwe are still seeing dangerous hostilities and skirmishes on the margins of Sweida. And violence could resume at any moment,.\u201d",
      "Pedersen expressed concern that \u201ca month of relative military calm belies a worsening political climate, with escalatory and zero-sum rhetoric hardening among many.\u201d",

      "In 2019, Lanza's study found that the hottest days saw lower bus ridership. But when the bus stops were shaded by trees, the area was twice as cool and prevented steep ridership lost. The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.",
      "As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.",
      "In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza\u2019s study to develop a plan to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.",
      "Julia Silver, a lifelong resident of California, used to spend her summers with her family at an outdoor public pool. Now, amid record-breaking heat waves, Silver and her family have spent the majority of the summer inside their Los Angeles home, the local mall or other air-conditioned facilities.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just kind of become unbearable during those hot summer days to spend time outside,\u201d said Silver, a researcher at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.",
      "In June, Institute launched a Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.",
      "\u201cThe disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,\u201d said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project\u2019s leader.",
      "Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.",
      "\u201cThe more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,\u201d Silver said.",
      "The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.",
      "\u201cBy shining a light on these patterns, we can start correcting them,\u201d said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, research faculty director at LPPI and principal investigator for the project.",

      "Florida conservative Joe Gruters has been a Donald Trump cheerleader dating back to the president\u2019s days as a reality TV star",
      "ATLANTA -- Florida conservative Joe Gruters, a Donald Trump cheerleader dating back to his days as a reality TV star, is the president's handpicked choice to be the next Republican National Committee chairman.",
      "Having no opposition, Gruters' formal election is scheduled Friday at the Republicans' summer meeting in Atlanta.",
      "For Gruters, the vote will complete a steady climb from county party leader into the top ranks of Trump\u2019s second presidency. For Trump, Gruters\u2019 ratification reflects his penchant for loyal lieutenants and evolution from a new president disinterested in party machinery to an Oval Office veteran intent on gripping all levers of power.",
      "Here is a look at Gruters\u2019 history with Trump and Republicans and what that means as he becomes chairman.",
      "Trump\u2019s decade of domination over Republican politics is replete with rivals and critics who melted into the fold. Vice President JD Vance once compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio labeled Trump a \u201ccon artist\u201d and mocked his manhood.",
      "But Gruters was a true believer years before Trump launched his first campaign in 2015.",
      "\u201cJoe bet on the horse before the track was even built,\u201d said Christian Ziegler, a former Florida Republican chair and friend of Gruters.",
      "In 2012, Gruters led the Sarasota County GOP, and Republicans were nominating Mitt Romney for president at their convention in nearby Tampa, Florida.",
      "Romney, then the kind of moderate Republican that is now almost extinct in public office, had embraced Trump even as the businessman falsely questioned then-President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace and citizenship. Still, Trump was widely considered a liability for Romney against Obama, and Romney\u2019s team was circumspect about whether Trump would have a convention role. While Trump was eventually confirmed as a speaker, an approaching tropical storm shortened the convention schedule, and his slot was among the casualties.",
      "Enter Gruters.",
      "The eager Sarasotan had already picked Trump as his county party\u2019s \u201cStatesman of the Year,\u201d slotting a dinner gala at Sarasota\u2019s Ritz-Carlton hotel on convention eve with 1,000 guests. It cemented an enduring friendship.",
      "Gruters\u2019 support for Trump\u2019s first presidential bid in 2015 stood out in Florida, given that Rubio and former Gov. Jeb Bush also were running.",
      "In October, Gruters became co-chairman of Trump\u2019s Florida campaign. His fellow chair was Susie Wiles, who is now Trump\u2019s White House chief of staff. Bush didn\u2019t make it to the Florida primary, and Trump trounced Rubio, ending the senator\u2019s campaign.",
      "Gruters was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016 at the same time Trump won Florida\u2019s electoral votes and the presidency. And Wiles, Gruters\u2019 old Trump campaign partner, was the mastermind behind Florida Gov. DeSantis\u2019 narrow 2018 victory.",
      "So when it mattered, Gruters was well-positioned with a friend in the Oval Office and the governor\u2019s office \u2014 buoyed by Wiles, who had distinguished herself as a Florida kingmaker.",
      "All those powerful allies backed Gruters' successful bid for Florida GOP chairman in 2019.",

Gruters chose his words carefully, stopping short of Trump\u2019s election denialism yet ensuring he never drew the defeated president\u2019s ire. Leaning on local results, Gruters called Florida the \u201cgold standard.\u201d He said there were \u201cquestions\u201d about \u201cshenanigans\u201d in other states.",

      "A certain Palm Beach resident, however, was not finished.",
      "As Trump built his third campaign, Wiles stuck with him \u2014 not DeSantis. The governor ultimately broke with Wiles and Gruters. Then Trump buried DeSantis, just as he\u2019d crushed Bush and Rubio. DeSantis made peace with Trump, but not with Gruters, describing him as recently as last month as having a \u201clinguine spine.\u201d",
      "Trump has cycled through multiple national GOP chairs. Reince Priebus in 2016 was the reluctant Trump backer who became the president\u2019s chief of staff in 2017, only to be fired via social media post. Trump then turned to Ronna Romney McDaniel, Mitt\u2019s niece. He eventually pushed out McDaniel and tapped North Carolina\u2019s Michael Whatley as chairman, with daughter-in-law Lara Trump as family stand-in at party headquarters.",
      "As chairman, Gruters will be a fundraising partner with the White House. The RNC is a key cog in joint party fundraising efforts that the president headlines.",
      "Trump has always been his own primary messenger, but Gruters will be another notable face as the president approaches the 2026 midterms. That doesn\u2019t just mean policy and branding but also the mechanics of elections. Gruters sidestepped Trump\u2019s election denialism, but he\u2019ll now be partly responsible for building teams of lawyers and poll watchers for a president who openly questions the efficacy of U.S. elections.",
      "Beyond the midterms, Gruters will be the chairman who helps set the presidential primary calendar, debate rules and other nuts and bolts of the 2028 campaign. While Trump is term-limited by the Constitution, he's more than made clear that he will not stay in the shadows as voters choose his successor. With Gruters, he has a direct line into that process.",

      "The United Nations says a drone attack on a U.N. convoy set fire to all 16 trucks carrying desperately needed food to Sudan\u2019s famine-hit North Darfur region and destroyed all the vehicles",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- A drone attack on a U.N. convoy set fire to all 16 trucks carrying desperately needed food to Sudan\u2019s famine-hit North Darfur region and destroyed all the vehicles, the United Nations said Thursday.",
      "U.N. associate spokesperson Daniela Gross told reporters that all drivers and personnel traveling with the World Food Program convoy are safe.",
      "Gross said it was not yet clear who was responsibility for Wednesday\u2019s attack, the second in the past three months to prevent a U.N. convoy from delivering to North Dafur. In early June, a convoy from the World Food Program and UNICEF was attacked while awaiting clearance to proceed to North Darfur\u2019s besieged capital, el-Fasher, killing five people and injuring several others.",
      "Sudan plunged into conflict in April 2023, when violence sparked by long-simmering tensions between its military and paramilitary leaders erupted in the capital, Khartoum, and spread to other regions, including western Darfur. Some 40,000 people have been killed and nearly 13 million displaced, U.N. agencies say. Nearly 25 million people are experiencing acute hunger, Gross said.",

      "Two years after piles of decaying bodies were found in a rural Colorado building, a funeral home owner is set to be sentenced for 191 counts of corpse abuse",
      "DENVER -- It's been two years since nearly 200 decaying bodies were discovered throughout a fetid, room temperature building in rural Colorado. On Friday, the man responsible, a funeral home owner, is set to be sentenced in state court for 191 counts of corpse abuse.",
      "Jon Hallford and his wife, Carie, ran a morbid racket for four years out of their Return to Nature Funeral Home in Colorado Springs: assuring people they were handling their loved ones' cremations only to stash the bodies in a bug-infested building and then giving them dry concrete resembling ashes.",
      "Jon Hallford is already headed to prison after pleading guilty to federal fraud charges. Friday's sentencing hearing will focus on state charges related to mistreatment of the bodies. Family members will have the chance to describe the anguish of learning a loved one slowly decayed among piles of others.",
      "\u201cTo me it\u2019s the heart of the case. It\u2019s the worst part of the crime,\u201d said Tanya Wilson, who is traveling from Georgia to speak at the sentencing. She hired the funeral home to cremate her mother and later discovered the supposed ashes the family spread in Hawaii weren't from her mother's body, which had been wasting away in the building in Penrose, a small town 35 miles from Colorado Springs.",
      "A plea agreement calls for Hallford to receive a 20-year prison sentence for the corpse abuse charges.",
      "Wilson said she and some other families want Judge Eric Bentley to reject the agreement because Hallford's state sentence is expected to run concurrently with his 20-year federal sentence, meaning he could be freed many years earlier than if the sentences ran consecutively.",
      "\u201cThe scale of this is staggering. Why does the state believe they deserve a plea deal?\u201d Wilson asked. \u201cThere needs to be accountability.\u201d",
      "If the judge rejects the agreement, Hallford would not be immediately sentenced and the case would likely go to an arraignment, the first step toward a criminal trial, said Kate Singh with the Fourth Judicial District District Attorney\u2019s Office.",
      "Colorado has struggled to effectively oversee funeral homes and for many years had some of the weakest regulations in the nation. It\u2019s had a slew of abuse cases, including an estimated 20 decomposing corpses discovered this week at a funeral home in Pueblo.",
      "Carie Hallford is accused of the same crimes as her husband and also pleaded guilty. Her sentencing on the corpse abuse charges has not been scheduled.",
      "The couple was accused of letting 189 bodies decay. In two other instances the wrong bodies were buried. Four remains have yet to be identified, Singh said.",

      "As the gruesome count grew, Jon and Carie Hallford were also defrauding the federal government out of nearly $900,000 in COVID-19 era aid.",
      "With the money from families and the federal government, the Hallfords bought ritzy items from stores like Tiffany & Co., a GMC Yukon and Infiniti worth $120,000 combined, laser body sculpting and $31,000 in cryptocurrency.",
      "In 2023, a putrid smell poured from the building and the police turned up. Investigators swarmed the building, donning hazmat suits and painstakingly extracting the bodies. Hallford and his wife were arrested in Oklahoma, where Jon Hallford had family, more than a month later.",
      "Families learned that their cathartic moments of grief \u2014 spreading a mother's ashes in Hawaii or cradling a son's urn in a rocking chair \u2014 were tainted by a deception. It was as if those signposts of the grieving process had been torn away, unraveling months and years of working through their loved ones' deaths.",
      "Some had nightmares of what their relatives' decayed bodies must have looked like. Others were anguished by the fear their family members' souls were trapped, unable to go free.",
      "A mother, Crystina Page, demanded to watch as her son's body, rescued from the Return to Nature building, was cremated for real. Wilson, who had thought she already spread her mother's ashes in Hawaii, said the family cremated her mother's remains after they were recovered by authorities. She is waiting for the court cases to conclude before returning to Hawaii again to spread the ashes.",

      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "FALCON HEIGHTS, Minn. -- It was a warm summer day but Malorie Thorson was dressed for winter as Gerry Kulzer sculpted a likeness of her head from a large block of butter Thursday in keeping with a 60-year-old tradition on the opening day of the Minnesota State Fair.",
      "Thorson, a 20-year-old from the town of Waverly, was crowned as the 72nd Princess Kay of the Milky Way on Wednesday night. And her first official duty as the goodwill ambassador for the state's 1,800 dairy farm families was to bundle up and sit in a rotating glassed-in studio at 40 degrees F (4 Celsius) as fairgoers gathered to watch Kulzer turn a 90-pound (41-kilogram) block of salted butter into art.",
      "Other state fairs also feature butter sculptures. The Iowa State Fair has been famous for its life-sized Butter Cow for over a century. A replica will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution's Renwick Gallery in Washington starting Saturday. The 2025 New York State Fair butter sculpture, unveiled Tuesday, is a 900-pound (410-kilogram) nod to the 125th anniversary of \u201cThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz\u201d by New York state native L. Frank Baum.",
      "But in Minnesota, all 10 of the dairy princess finalists get a likeness of their heads carved before an ever-changing live audience. Each one gets to take their sculpture home after the fair, along with a bucket of the scraps. They can deep-freeze their heads as souvenirs or share them with family and friends, maybe spreading some of the butter onto corn on the cob.",
      "Wearing her tiara on her head, her sash over her overcoat and her gloves folded on her lap, Thorson said she loved the break from the nearly 80 degree (27 Celsius) heat outside.",
      "But she added it was an \u201cunreal experience\u201d to find herself at the center of attention because her mother had been taking her to the fair and its dairy stands since she was at least 3. She said her mother had been a Princess Kay finalist in 1996.",
      "Thorson expressed confidence that Kulzer would do her justice.",
      "\u201cI have so much faith in him. I usually don\u2019t have as much faith in a lot of people because I like to be in control sometimes,\" the South Dakota State University student said. \"So it\u2019s really nice to just sit back, relax and know that he\u2019s going to do a great job.\u201d",

      "\"That was probably the worst audition in my life,\" he recalled.",

      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",

Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death.

      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",
      "Don't you worry 'bout your curly hair Clothes that don't quite fit you anywhere Voices echo in the gym Another girl's had her first kiss Please don't think too much of it, darling",
      "I asked, \"What do you think your 13-year-old self would think of all of this?\"",
      "\"I think she'd be really excited,\" Laufey replied. \"I think she'd be really happy. There's not a single part of myself that has changed any of my artistic interests to follow some sort of trend. And I get to make exactly the music that I loved back then. So, I think I would've been really, really happy.\"",

    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 14:39:28 -0400",
    "summary": "Cracker Barrel stock plunged as much as 15% after the restaurant chain released a new logo that removes its long-time image of a man leaning against a barrel.",
    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value after its stock plunged Thursday following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 billion in its capitalization.",
      "The slide appeared to be halted on Friday, with Cracker Barrel's shares up roughly one point, or 1.3%, as of 12:03 p.m. EST.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million for year, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "On Friday, the president took it a step further: \"I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,\" he said.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.",

      "\"Our policy rate is now 100 basis points closer to neutral than it was a year ago, and the stability of the unemployment rate and other labor market measures allows us to proceed carefully as we consider changes to our policy stance,\" Powell said.",
      "Despite mounting pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held off on cutting rates this year as it monitors the impact of Trump administration's tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Powell's speech on Friday, however, may be the strongest indication yet that policy changes could be afoot.",
      "\"With Powell acknowledging that it may be time for the Fed to alter its restrictive policy, this could set up stocks for a short-term relief rally,\" said Bret Kenwell, eToro investment analyst, in an email note on Friday.",
      "\"When Fed chairs open the door for a rate cut, it's quite difficult to close,\" Ryan Sweet, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. \"The August employment report or consumer price index are unlikely enough to change Powell's opinion.\"",
      "The central bank is tasked with so-called dual mandate of maximum employment and minimal inflation \u2014 a tricky balance to strike as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "On Friday, Powell noted that job force growth has \"slowed considerably\" and that the \"downside risks to employment are rising.\" Job growth came in weaker than expected in July, with employers adding 73,000 jobs. The Labor Department also revised job growth\u00a0sharply down for May and June.",
      "\"Overall, while the labor market appears to be in balance, it is a curious kind of balance that results from a marked slowing in both the supply of and demand for workers,\" he said.",
      "Inflation has remained in check this year, although it's still above the Fed's 2% target. Powell noted Friday that tariffs have begun to push up prices in certain categories.",
      "The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, is scheduled to meet next on Sept. 17. Interest rate traders now put the likelihood of a cut at 89%, according to the CME Group's FedWatch Tool.",

      "\"Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment are to the downside \u2014 a challenging situation,\" Powell said in his speech.",
      "The Fed will \"proceed carefully\" but the shifting balance of risks \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.",
      "Powell's remarks signal the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, which would mark the first reduction since December 2024, several economists said in research notes following the speech. Wall Street cheered Powell's remarks, with the S&P 500 jumping 1.3% in late morning trading.",
      "\"That's about as clear cut as Powell can get that he has shifted his view since July and is leaning toward a cut in September,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"He justifies this change in view by acknowledging the downside risks to employment after the shocking July jobs report.\"",
      "While Powell highlighted the slowdown in the labor market, he also maintained that inflation risks from Mr. Trump's tariffs remain. The Fed has been closely watching the nation's inflation rate, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% annual target and which has inched higher in recent months.",
      "Under the Fed's mandate, the central bank is tasked with keeping both inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Powell said the tariffs could result in a \"one-time shift in the price level,\" resulting in a short-term boost to inflation.",
      "\"Of course, 'one-time' does not mean 'all at once',\" he added. \"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\"",
      "Powell's comments come as he faces a range of pressures, including President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation and conflicting economic signals that could make it tougher for the Fed to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting full employment while keeping inflation in check.",

      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, could be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "\"The last time we heard from the chair at the July FOMC meeting, Powell struck a notably hawkish tone, arguing that the labor market was 'solid' and that inflation was still too high, even excluding tariff effects,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note this week. \"We expect a somewhat different tone from Powell this week, particularly with respect to the labor market.\"",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "Filed in California federal court, the lawsuit accused Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs of intentionally using complicated cancellation procedures to prevent their customers from ending their gym memberships and other recurring charges. The California-based companies \"have illegally charged hundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\" as a result, the FTC said in its complaint.",
      "Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs run gym chains including L.A. Fitness, Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club and City Studio, according to the FTC, which said they collectively operate more than 600 gym locations and have upwards of 3.7 million members nationwide.",
      "\"The FTC's complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2013 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\" said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Consumer Protection Bureau, in a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by the trade commission. \"Tens of thousands of LA Fitness customers reported difficulties \u2013 cancellation was often restricted to specific times or required speaking to specific managers who were often not present or available.\"",
      "Both companies offer gym memberships for fees as low as $30 per month and as high as $299 per month, and require customers to pay for the first and last month of their memberships upfront before incurring monthly dues and annual fees, the FTC said. In its complaint, the commission detailed \"restrictive\" and confusing cancellation requirements, with an in-person process that's difficult to access being one method, and a mail-in process being another.",
      "\"Each of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding\u2014far from simple,\" the complaint said. \"In particular, Defendants have not adequately disclosed how to cancel when consumers are signing up for their memberships and have presented different, often contradictory, cancellation requirements during sign up, in membership agreements, and on the Defendants' websites.\"",

      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",

      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",
      "The quality of Gemini's responses also improved over the same time period, the company said.",

      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia, who is Salvadoran, had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador. The judge also ruled that Abrego Garcia must receive 72 hours' notice if the Trump administration plans to deport him anywhere other than his country of origin, El Salvador.",

      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "On Friday, the president took it a step further: \"I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,\" he said.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, could be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "\"The last time we heard from the chair at the July FOMC meeting, Powell struck a notably hawkish tone, arguing that the labor market was 'solid' and that inflation was still too high, even excluding tariff effects,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note this week. \"We expect a somewhat different tone from Powell this week, particularly with respect to the labor market.\"",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation.

      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",

      "A State Department spokesperson said later Thursday the pause was done \"in order to conduct a comprehensive and thorough review of screening and vetting protocols used to determine their qualifications for a U.S. visa.\"",
      "The spokesperson noted it \"applies to all nationalities and is not directed at any specific country.\"",
      "The Trump administration in the past months has taken steps to enforce the requirement that truckers\u00a0speak and read\u00a0English proficiently. The Transportation Department said the aim is to improve road safety following incidents in which drivers' ability to read signs or speak English may have contributed to traffic deaths.",
      "\"As we have seen with recent deadly accidents, foreign truckers can pose risks to American lives, U.S. national security, and foreign policy interests,\" the State Department spokesperson said. \"Ensuring that every driver on our roads meets the highest standards is important to protecting the livelihoods of American truckers and maintaining a secure, resilient supply chain.\"",
      "The move comes\u00a0amid a commercial truck driver shortage\u00a0in the U.S. According to the American Trucking Association, a trade group, the industry is facing a shortage of about 60,000 drivers.",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia could be released from detention and head back to his home state of Maryland as early as Friday, the latest move in a months-long saga that has become a symbol of President Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "Abrego Garcia was detained in March, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, held for months in a notorious prison where he alleges he was tortured, and eventually returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face criminal charges in Tennessee. The Trump administration has accused him of gang membership and smuggling, allegations he and his family have staunchly denied.",
      "A Nashville-based federal magistrate judge ordered Abrego Garcia to be released from jail two months ago while he awaits a criminal trial set to begin in January. That order had been delayed at the request of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, who feared that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could immediately detain him and try to deport him again.",
      "The latest delay to Abrego Garcia's release from jail runs out on Friday \u2014 meaning that within hours, he could leave custody for the first time in months. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes indicated Thursday that she plans to enter an order for his release.",
      "But it's unclear if or when Abrego Garcia will be detained by ICE yet again.",
      "What happens after Abrego Garcia is released?",
      "Holmes is expected to set conditions for Abrego Garcia's release when she issues her order allowing him to walk out of jail.",
      "If Abrego Garcia is released, he plans to return to Maryland, where he and his family lived prior to his March detention by ICE. Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in court papers this week that they hired a private security company with \"experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases\" to bring him to Maryland.",
      "His attorneys have asked Holmes to give him 48 hours following his departure from jail to report to pre-trial services in Maryland. The Justice Department \u2014 which has opposed releasing Abrego Garcia \u2014 said this week it isn't opposed to a 48-hour grace period, noting that Abrego Garcia is expected to wear an electronic monitoring device once he leaves custody.",
      "The next question is whether Abrego Garcia will go straight from pre-trial jail to ICE custody.",
      "Once he's released, immigration agents aren't allowed to immediately take Abrego Garcia into custody in Tennessee, under a ruling last month by Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis. When he gets back to Maryland, the government must put him back into the same ICE supervision program that he belonged to before he was detained, and they need to give him 72 hours' notice if they plan to initiate deportation to a country other than El Salvador, said Xinis.",
      "Can Abrego Garcia be deported again?",
      "Xinis' order does not prevent ICE from initiating immigration proceedings against Abrego Garcia once he returns to Maryland. She wrote last month that the government \"may take whatever action is available to them under the law.\"",
      "But if he's detained by ICE again, the government's plans for where he'd be sent are unclear.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, told Xinis last month.",
      "Giles said ICE would take custody of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible,\" and would determine \"based on bed space availability\" where to hold him.",
      "In June, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn told Xinis the government would seek to deport Abrego Garcia to a \"third country\" \u2014 that is, a country other than El Salvador. He added that there were \"no imminent plans\" to remove him from the United States.",
      "However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called a June report on Abrego Garcia's possible deportation \"fake news,\" writing on X: \"He will face the full force of the American justice system - including serving time in American prison for the crimes he's committed.\"",
      "There are legal barriers to deporting Abrego Garcia to his home country of El Salvador \u2014 which he left more than a decade ago before entering the U.S. illegally at the age of 16.",
      "In 2019, a judge barred the government from sending him to El Salvador, on the grounds that he feared persecution by local gangs. Despite that ruling, the Trump administration sent him to El Salvador in March \u2014 where he was held at the notorious CECOT mega-prison. A government attorney later admitted in court that the move was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "That error set off the court saga surrounding Abrego Garcia. Xinis had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court affirmed. But he remained in the Central American country for months as the Trump administration claimed it was up to the Salvadoran government to decide whether to return him, drawing frustration from Xinis, before he was finally flown back to face criminal charges in June.",
      "What charges is Abrego Garcia facing?",
      "Abrego Garcia was federally charged in June with conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.",
      "The government alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in a smuggling ring that transported undocumented immigrants from Texas to elsewhere in the U.S. Federal prosecutors also accused Abrego Garcia of belonging to the Salvadoran gang MS-13.",
      "\"As we have said since Day 1, this M13-gang member and human trafficker won't be on \u2026 American streets again,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have strongly denied the government's allegations, including claims that he belonged to MS-13. Earlier this week, his lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the charges, accusing the Trump administration of engaging in a \"vindictive and selective prosecution.\"",
      "His attorneys wrote Tuesday that \"the only possible explanation for the timing of the charges here is that the government chose to use this prosecution to punish Mr. Abrego for exercising his right to challenge the violations of due process that led to his unconstitutional deportation, incarceration, and torture in El Salvador.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with the cancellation of National Institutes of Health research grants tied to issues like gender identity and diversity, equity and inclusion.",
      "In a 5-4 decision, in which Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided in part with the majority, and Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the minority, the high court lifted a lower court order that required the NIH to restore hundreds of research grants that had been canceled because they were tied to these issues. But the legal challenge over the from 16 states and a coalition of research groups will continue to play out in the lower court.",
      "The court's divided\u00a0decision enables the administration to pull back awards that it says do not align with its policy objectives. Since returning to the White House for a second term, President Trump has directed federal agencies to cancel DEI-related grants or contracts and ensure federal funds do not go toward initiatives involving gender identity.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court arose after the Department of Health and Human Services and the head of NIH issued a series of directives in February that led to the\u00a0cancellation of grant awards\u00a0that were connected to DEI or gender identity, as well as research topics including vaccine hesitancy, COVID and climate change.",
      "The states and research groups challenged the grant terminations in April, arguing the move violated the Constitution and a federal law governing the agency rulemaking process. The plaintiffs sought to block NIH from ending grants and to have funding that had already been axed restored.",
      "A federal judge in Massachusetts held a bench trial and\u00a0ruled in June\u00a0that the grant terminations were unlawful. Judge William Young, a Reagan appointee, ordered that the directives from the Trump administration and resulting grant terminations be set aside.",
      "Justice Barrett wrote Thursday that the District Court lacked the jurisdiction to order the grants to be restored. The majority ruling said that \"challenges to the grant terminations...belong in the Court of Federal Claims.\" That court hears money claims related to the Constitution, \"federal statutes, executive regulations, or contracts, express or implied in fact, with the United States.\"",
      "But she sided with the minority on another question about the legality of the agency guidance and indicated that the plaintiffs, to \"obtain complete relief,\" might have to pursue it in two separate courts.",
      "\"[M]y preliminary judgment is that the plaintiffs' challenges to the grant terminations belong in the [Court of Federal Claims], and their [Administrative Procedure Act] challenges to the guidance belong in district court,\" Barrett wrote.",
      "Roberts said in his dissent argued that the relief granted by the lower court \"falls well within the scope of the District Court's jurisdiction,\" and \"if the District Court had jurisdiction to vacate the directives, it also had jurisdiction to vacate the 'Resulting Grant Terminations.'\"",
      "NIH has a $47 billion budget and is considered the world's largest funder of biomedical research. As a result of the NIH and HHS directives, more than 1,700 grants were canceled nationwide, including more than 800 awarded to public universities, state instrumentalities and local governments in16 states that challenged the move. Lawyers for the Democratic state attorneys general told the Supreme Court in a filing that the sudden cancellation of the grants forced their universities to lay off or furlough employees, cut student enrollment and withdraw admissions offers.",
      "In the U.S. District Court, Judge Young found that NIH engaged in \"no reasoned decision-making\" in rolling out the grant terminations, and wrote there was \"not a shred of evidence\" to back up the administration's claims that DEI studies are used to support discrimination on the basis of race and other protected characteristics.",
      "The Trump administration asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit to pause the district court's decision, which it declined to do.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the high court for emergency relief last month. In his emergency appeal, the solicitor general argued that the Supreme Court had a chance to \"stop errant district courts from continuing to disregard\" its decisions.",
      "Sauer pointed to an April order from the justices that cleared the way for the Department of Education to halt millions of dollars in teacher-training grants that it said funded programs that involve DEI initiatives. The high court said in that case that the Trump administration was likely to succeed in showing that the federal district court that oversaw the dispute lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under federal law.",
      "The solicitor general said the judicial system does not rest on a \"lower-court free-for-all where individual district judges feel free to elevate their own policy judgments over those of the Executive Branch, and their own legal judgments over those of this Court.\"",
      "But the public health groups warned that even a brief stay of the district court's decision reinstating the grants would invalidate crucial multiyear projects that have already been paid for by Congress, \"inflicting incalculable losses in public health and human life because of delays in bringing the fruits of plaintiffs' research to Americans who desperately await clinical advancements.\"",
      "They warned that pulling the grants would do irreversible harm to public health, halting biomedical research that Congress directed NIH to fund.",
      "\"That, and the obvious harm to those who suffer from chronic or life-threatening diseases and their loved ones, must be balanced against NIH's ill-defined monetary interests and any asserted incursion on its policymaking latitude,\" the research organizations wrote in a filing.",

      "A federal judge on Thursday ordered an indefinite halt to new construction at an immigration detention facility that Florida officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\"\u00a0and barred any new detainees from being brought to the site, siding with environmental groups who said the facility is endangering the Everglades and its wildlife.",
      "The decision is a setback for Florida's Republican-led state government and its aggressive efforts to aid the Trump administration's hardline immigration agenda, including by deputizing thousands of state police as federal immigration officers.",
      "The order by U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams did not require Florida officials to completely cease operations at Alligator Alcatraz, allowing the state to continue using existing structures there to detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. But Williams barred any more detainees from being transferred to the site \u2014 dashing plans to expand the detention center.",
      "The ruling says state and federal authorities cannot add any new tents to the site or carry out any paving or excavating, though they can repair existing facilities for safety purposes.",
      "It also directs them to remove temporary fencing, light fixtures and generators from the site within 60 days. Housing facilities can remain in place, the judge said.",
      "Williams wrote that, for decades, \"every  Florida  governor,  every  Florida senator,  and  countless  local  and  national  political  figures,  including  presidents,  have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection  of  the  Everglades.  This  Order  does  nothing  more  than  uphold  the  basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.\"",
      "The state of Florida filed notice of appeal Thursday night.",
      "The makeshift detention facility \u2014 located in what was largely an abandoned airfield \u2014 is one of several locations and prisons that Republican-led states have offered the Trump administration so they can be converted into immigration detention centers. Officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also allowed facilities in their states to hold immigrants facing deportation.",
      "Thursday's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the Miccosukee tribe and environmental activists who challenged operations at Alligator Alcatraz on environmental grounds. The Everglades are an ecologically sensitive area that's home to endangered species, and many Floridians rely on the Everglades as a source of drinking water.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that environmental reviews mandated in federal law should have been completed before the site was set up.",
      "Florida officials have argued Alligator Alcatraz is not subject to those federal environmental requirements because the facility is run by the state. The Trump administration has said it will reimburse Florida for the effort using federal funds.",
      "Williams had paused further construction at Alligator Alcatraz earlier this month, but only for two weeks.",
      "A separate lawsuit over the legal rights of those held at the Everglades facility is also playing out.",
      "That case was partially dismissed by the U.S. District Court Judge Rodolfo Ruiz earlier this week, since the Trump administration had designated an immigration court to hear the claims of those detained at Alligator Alcatraz, one of the main concerns raised by the lawsuit. But Ruiz allowed another part of the case centered on detainees' right to in-person and confidential legal consultations to proceed, transferring the lawsuit to another federal judge.",

    "story": [
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday signed into law a\u00a0contentious congressional redistricting plan, as state Democrats seek to counter a Trump-backed effort to add to the GOP's House majority by redrawing Texas' congressional maps.",
      "The new map\u00a0\u2014 which still needs to be approved by voters \u2014 would shift five of California's Republican U.S. House seats to be more favorable to Democrats in the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "The legislation easily passed the Democratic-led Assembly and Senate on Thursday. After Newsom's signature, it will be added to the ballot on Nov. 4 for the voters' final say. That election is likely to be expensive and unpredictable, given how quickly the effort has come together and how little time there is between the state Legislature's actions and voters starting to have their say.",
      "California Democrats insisted they had no choice but to undertake the new maps after President Trump intervened in Texas and asked Republican lawmakers to redraw the districts to preserve the GOP's razor-thin majority in the U.S. House. Following Newsom's declaration that he would redraw California's maps, several other states said they would undertake similar efforts.",
      "\"They fired the first shot, Texas. We wouldn't be here had Texas not done what they just did,\" Newsom said during a signing ceremony Thursday. \"We're neutralizing what occurred [in Texas] and we're giving the American people a fair chance.\"",
      "Although California Republicans have denounced the redistricting plan as a \"tit-for-tat strategy,\" the state's Democrats on Thursday touted that the effort is different from Texas since it ultimately needs approval from the state's voters.",
      "\"In California, we will do whatever it takes to ensure that voters, not Donald Trump, will decide the direction of this country,\" Assembly Speaker Robert Rivas said. \"This is a proud moment in the history of this assembly. Californians, we believe in freedom. We will not let our political system be hijacked by authoritarianism, and today, we give every Californian the power to say no. To say no to Donald Trump's power grab and yes to our people, to our state and to our democracy.\"",
      "California responds to Texas' redistricting",
      "The Republican-led Texas House on Wednesday approved the new congressional maps after a two-week delay when Democrats left the state to deny a quorum to bring the measure to the floor. The measure now goes to the Texas Senate, where it is likely to pass.",
      "Shortly after the Texas House passed the maps, Newsom posted to social media: \"It's on.\" When Texas first launched its redistricting effort, Newsom had vowed to redraw the Golden State's congressional districts to counter the Lone Star State's plan and neutralize any potential GOP gains.",
      "Newsom \u2014 who is widely seen as a possible 2028 presidential contender \u2014 sarcastically congratulated Texas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott on X, saying, \"You will now go down in history as one of Donald Trump's most loyal lapdogs. Shredding our nation's founding principles. What a legacy.\"",
      "Mr. Trump late Wednesday congratulated Texas Republicans for advancing the new maps, writing on social media that \"Everything Passed, on our way to FIVE more Congressional seats and saving your Rights, your Freedoms, and your Country, itself.\" He also encouraged GOP-led Indiana and Florida to take on redistricting.",
      "The relatively rare mid-decade redistricting gambit comes as both parties prepare to face off in 2026 and has major implications nationwide. Republicans have a narrow majority at the moment, and Democrats winning back three seats in the 2026 midterms could be enough to flip control of the chamber if the lines used in the 2024 election were still in place. Redistricting in red states could change that dynamic significantly, however, and with it the impact of the final two years on Mr. Trump's second term in office.",
      "Texas and California are the two biggest redistricting battlegrounds, but Mr. Trump has pushed similar efforts in GOP-led Indiana and Florida, and New York Democrats have floated redrawing their House map. The Republican-led state of Missouri could also try and redraw a Democratic district in the coming weeks, and new maps are also expected in Ohio, where a redraw brought about by state law could impact some of the red state's Democratic members of Congress.",
      "Earlier this week, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that he was not a fan of partisan gerrymandering, but he backed Newsom's redistricting plan anyway at a fundraiser in Martha's Vineyard and on social media, calling it a \"smart, measured approach.\"",
      "Less than 24 hours before\u00a0 California's scheduled vote, Newsom joined a press call with Democratic party leaders, urging support for his state's redistricting effort.",
      "\"This is about taking back our country,\" Newsom told reporters. \"This is about the Democratic Party now punching back forcefully and very intentionally.\"",
      "A draft congressional map unveiled by California Democrats late last week would heavily impact five of the state's nine Republican U.S. House members. It would redraw Reps. Doug LaMalfa and Kevin Kiley's Northern California districts, tweak Rep. David Valadao's district in the Central Valley and rearrange parts of densely populated Southern California, impacting Reps. Ken Calvert and Darrell Issa. And some more competitive Democrat-held districts could be tilted further from the GOP.",
      "There's no guarantee that Democrats will win in all five newly recast districts.",
      "California Republicans push back against redistricting",
      "Democrats hold large majorities in both chambers of California's state legislature. But some legal hurdles still lie ahead, and Republicans in the state have pushed back against the redistricting plans.",
      "Unlike Texas, California has an independent redistricting commission that was created by voters earlier this century. To overhaul the current congressional map, a constitutional amendment would need to be passed by a two-thirds vote in California's Assembly and Senate and be approved by voters in the fast-moving fall election.",
      "On Wednesday, the California Supreme Court denied a GOP attempt to stop the mid-cycle redistricting. California Republicans had legally challenged Democrats' efforts, claiming the state's constitution gives Californians the right to review new legislation for 30 days. But Chief Justice Patricia Guerrero said they \"failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time.\"",
      "The GOP legislators who filed the legal challenge told CBS News the ruling is \"not the end of this fight,\" vowing to keep fighting the redistricting plan in the courts.",
      "In a phone interview with CBS News on Wednesday, California Senate Minority Leader Brian Jones, a Republican, condemned Newsom's redistricting efforts.",
      "\"This whole process is illegal from the beginning and violates the current California Constitution,\" Jones said. \"The voters spoke with a loud voice in 2008 and 2010 that they were taking this process out of the politicians' hands and putting the responsibility into an independent commission.\"",
      "Democrats faced a flurry of questions from Republican lawmakers during hearings this week on the alleged lack of transparency in the drafting of these maps and the financial implications of the Nov. 4 special election.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump addressed a crowd of federal law enforcement officers in Washington, D.C., on Thursday, amid an anti-crime initiative that has swamped the capital with police and National Guard members.",
      "The president visited a U.S. Park Police facility in Southeast D.C., where he thanked federal agents and handed out hamburgers that he said were prepared at the White House and pizza from a local restaurant.",
      "\"You're incredible people. You make the country run, frankly,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In brief remarks, Mr. Trump told the crowd the capital city will be \"maxxed out in terms of beauty\" in the next six to 12 months, listing out plans to clean graffiti, repair park grass and fix road medians. Several other administration officials also addressed the officers, including Attorney General Pam Bondi and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Some 2,000 Guard personnel from D.C. and several GOP-led states are in the capital, along with a surge of officers from agencies like the FBI and Drug Enforcement Administration.",
      "Mr. Trump has also asserted federal control over the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, drawing pushback from local politicians who argued the move was a threat to the city's autonomy. Last week, the Justice Department backed down from an attempt to name an emergency local police chief following a lawsuit from D.C. officials.",
      "Hours earlier, Mr. Trump said he would go out in D.C. to patrol the city alongside law enforcement and the Guard. The president made the announcement as the Metropolitan Police Department tells CBS News no homicides have been reported in the district in over a week.",
      "\"I'm going to be going out tonight, I'm going to keep it a secret,\" the president joked to radio host Todd Starnes. \"I'm going to be out tonight, I think with the police, and with the military, of course. So we're going to do a job. The National Guard is great. They've done a fantastic job.\"",
      "The president's visit came a day after Vice President JD Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller visited National Guard members posted at Union Station.",
      "Since the Trump administration began its initiative, a total of 630 arrests have been made, and 86 illegal guns have been seized, according to Bondi.",
      "Unlike other presidents, Mr. Trump has made few ventures into the district, other than to deliver speeches or, during his first term, to visit his former hotel down Pennsylvania Avenue. Past presidents have occasionally dined at D.C. restaurants.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted that people he knows feel safer in the city than they have before.",
      "\"People that haven't gone out to dinner in Washington, D.C., in two years are going out to dinner,\" Mr. Trump claimed earlier this week.",
      "Local officials say the initiative is unnecessary and Mr. Trump's claims about safety issues in D.C. are overblown. According to local police data, violent crime in D.C. has been declining for the last year and a half after spiking in 2023. As of\u00a0Aug. 11, robberies this year are down 28% and overall violent crime is down 26%. Last year, violent crime in the capital city hit its lowest level in more than 30 years, the\u00a0Justice Department\u00a0said.",
      "Mr. Trump, however, has called D.C. crime statistics \"phony numbers,\" and said his administration would \"look into that.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump signaled Thursday that Missouri will be the next state to redraw its congressional lines to benefit the Republican Party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "It's a continuation of the arms race between Republican-and Democratic-controlled states over redistricting, kickstarted by President Trump. At the president's urging, the GOP-controlled Texas state House\u00a0 passed a new, heavily Republican map this week, with the state Senate expected to vote on the new districts Friday.",
      "In a post on Truth Social on Thursday, Trump wrote, \"The Great State of Missouri is now IN. I'm not surprised\u2026 We're going to win the Midterms in Missouri again, bigger and better than ever before!\" He later said in a radio interview the same day that Missouri, Indiana and Florida are the next GOP-controlled states he believes will redraw congressional maps to create more Republican districts.",
      "Missouri has eight U.S. House seats in Congress, and two of them are held by Democrats. Any effort to draw a new district to give Republicans one more seat in their favor would likely focus on changing the Kansas City-focused district represented by longtime Democratic Rep. Emanuel Cleaver.",
      "A spokesperson for Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe, who has not yet made the call for a special session for redistricting, said he's continuing to have conversations with state leadership \"to assess options for a special session that would allow the General Assembly to provide congressional districts that best represent Missourians.\"",
      "Missouri's treasurer and lieutenant governor, both Republicans, also say they favor a new map.",
      "\"We missed the chance to secure a 7-1 map in 2022, a mistake President Trump rightly calls on us to fix. Missouri's next congressional map must protect Missouri values and ensure our representatives in Congress are as conservative as the voters who send them,\" Lt. Gov. David Wasinger said in a statement in July.",
      "The expectation in the state capital of Jefferson City is that redrawing to add one more Republican-friendly seat is \"for sure happening,\" according to one Missouri Republican operative familiar with conversations among lawmakers.",
      "\"[Governor Kehoe] is doing everything that can be done to prevent a legal challenge. They're just crossing the Ts and dotting the I's. I haven't heard anything about any reservation from the governor's office,\" the operative said.",
      "\"The appetite is there and I think everybody just knows it's going to happen,\" the operative added.",
      "The redistricting plan would likely be tacked onto a veto session in the state that was already scheduled to take place on Sept. 10.",
      "Most of Missouri's GOP congressional members have already thrown their support to a map proposed by the White House and Mr. Trump's orbit, according to this operative. Mr. Trump won the Show-Me State by 18 points in 2024.",
      "\"I believe that President Trump's team and his White House staff are very interested in redistricting because really, a lot is at stake,\" Republican Rep. Bob Onder said in a local NBC News interview in late July.",
      "Some Missouri Republicans pushed \u2014 and failed \u2014 to draw a map including a new Republican-leaning seat that would result in a GOP-Democratic split of 7-1 during the last redistricting cycle in 2021 and 2022.",
      "\"We should have enacted a 7-1 map three years ago, but better late than never,\" Missouri GOP State Senator Curtis Trent posted.",
      "Missouri GOP lawmakers visited the White House earlier this summer for what was characterized as a general meeting with administration officials before the larger redistricting war began. Another previously scheduled meeting at the White House with Indiana lawmakers is also planned for Aug. 26, according to a White House official.",
      "While the gain Republicans could make in Missouri is likely just one seat, a GOP-led shift could have a major impact. If Democrats win as few as three GOP seats in the U.S. House in next year's midterm elections, they could flip control of the chamber. The number needed to shift who leads the chamber may be affected by the final outcome in the broader redistricting clash between Republicans and Democrats in the coming weeks and months.",
      "At Mr. Trump's urging, Texas Republicans triggered the redistricting feud with its efforts in recent weeks to overhaul the state's maps and make five congressional districts held by Democrats more favorable to the GOP. With that shift on the brink of becoming law, California Democrats are working to offset those gains with their own redrawing, which would take five of its GOP-held districts and make them more winnable for Democrats.",
      "California Democrats face a higher hurdle than Texas Republicans because they must amend the state's constitution, in order to sideline a citizen redistricting commission for the next few cycles and force through more overly partisan lines. That means California voters will essentially be able to decide in a November special election whether to sign off on Democrats' plan.",
      "If California and Texas essentially cancel each other out with their new congressional lines, the shifts the White House is pushing in smaller states including Missouri and Indiana could loom larger. While both are red states with Republican governors, each has Democrats in their congressional delegations.",
      "In Missouri, any move to try and make Cleaver's Kansas City district a GOP seat is likely to be met with a major outcry, similar to what Democrats have seen in other states this year where mid-decade redistricting could be in play. Cleaver, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, first won his House seat in the 2004 election after having served as mayor of Kansas City, Missouri.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's Thursday Truth Social post, Missouri Democratic state Sen. Stephen Webber said on social media that it \"Looks like Republicans in the #MoLeg have received their marching orders from the federal government. Pathetic to watch grown adult \"leaders\" flop around like caught fish when a New Yorker that thinks the Chiefs play in Kansas tweets at them how to run Missouri.\"",

      "The new congressional lines that Republicans are attempting to pass in Texas created a situation where Doggett, who represents Texas' 37th congressional district, and Casar, who represents the 35th congressional district, would likely have had to run against each other on the Democratic side in the 37th district due to new boundaries reshaping Casar's current seat into one favorable to Republicans.",
      "Both Casar and Doggett currently represent parts of Austin, Texas. Casar's current seat would be massively redrawn in the proposed changes.",
      "Doggett said in a campaign statement Thursday that \"if the courts give Trump a victory in his scheme to maintain control of a compliant House, I will not seek reelection in the reconfigured CD37, even though it contains over 2/3rd of my current constituents.\"",

    "summary": "Alina Habba, President Trump's former personal lawyer, has been serving as New Jersey's U.S. attorney \"without lawful authority\" since early July, a judge said.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's former personal lawyer Alina Habba is serving illegally as the U.S. attorney for New Jersey.",
      "The judge's decision came after three men facing criminal charges in the state challenged her appointment, arguing that Habba's appointment last month as acting U.S. Attorney in the District of New Jersey violated the Federal Vacancies Reform Act.",
      "U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann of Pennsylvania wrote that Habba has been serving \"without lawful authority\" since the beginning of July and \"must be disqualified from participating in any ongoing cases.\"",
      "The judge did not toss out the criminal indictments of the three men who challenged Habba's appointment, but said she cannot supervise their prosecutions. Two of the three defendants were charged with drug offenses, and the other was charged with investment fraud and bribery.",
      "\"Faced with the question of whether Ms. Habba is lawfully performing the functions and duties of the office of the United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey, I conclude that she is not,\" Brann wrote.",
      "The ruling does not apply beyond the two criminal cases, and Brann put his order on hold to give the Justice Department the opportunity to appeal. But it follows a weekslong saga over whether Habba is serving lawfully, prompting a showdown between the Trump administration and the judicial branch.",
      "Earlier this year, Habba, a former defense attorney for Mr. Trump, was named interim U.S. attorney in New Jersey. Federal law restricted her time in the post to 120 days, unless the district court extended her tenure or she won Senate confirmation. New Jersey's two senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, opposed her nomination, making it highly unlikely it would advance through the upper chamber.",
      "As Habba's interim status approached the 120-day limit, New Jersey federal district court judges set off a leadership scramble in the U.S. attorney's office when they declined to keep Habba in the role. The judges instead installed her second-in-command, Desiree Leigh Grace, as the state's top federal prosecutor.",
      "However, shortly after that decision, Attorney General Pam Bondi fired Grace, a career prosecutor in the office.",
      "To circumvent the judge's order, Mr. Trump withdrew Habba's nomination to serve as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, which temporarily cleared the way for her to serve as the U.S. attorney in the state in an acting capacity \u2014 which is legally different from interim status \u2014 until Thursday's order.",
      "Brann concluded Thursday that Habba's acting appointment was unlawful under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. He also wrote that the Trump administration was only legally allowed to pick an interim U.S. attorney for 120 total days \u2014 and that clock started in early March, when Habba's predecessor was appointed, not in late March, when the job went to Habba.",
      "And he said Habba can't carry out the job of U.S. attorney without the title, striking down an effort by the Justice Department to name her \"special attorney.\"",
      "For those reasons, Brann wrote, Habba has served unlawfully since July 1.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey for comment.",
      "Because New Jersey federal judges had a conflict of interest in the case due to the order to remove Habba, the defendants' motions were assigned to Brann, who was appointed to the federal district court in Pennsylvania by President Barack Obama in 2012.",

      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm.

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:27:26 -0400",
    "summary": "Lizelle Gonzalez was indicted on murder charges in 2022, after she used medication to induce an abortion. The charges were later dropped.",
    "story": [
      "A South Texas woman who was arrested on murder charges in 2022 after using medication to terminate her pregnancy has alleged new details about her case against a local sheriff and prosecutors, claiming they violated her constitutional rights.",
      "Her Aug. 12 court filing comes as the debate over medicated abortion is heating up in Texas, with Attorney General Ken Paxton announcing a new effort to prevent the abortion pill from being mailed into Texas.",
      "\"These abortion drug organizations and radical activists are not above the law, and I have ordered the immediate end of this unlawful conduct,\" Paxton said Wednesday.",
      "The case of Lizelle Gonzalez was among the first to expose the complexities of criminalizing the use of medication to end a pregnancy. Starr County, located on the southern Texas border, launched an investigation into Gonzalez after hospital staff reported to law enforcement that she had taken medication to induce an abortion when she was 19 weeks pregnant. Three months later, she was indicted and arrested. Gonzalez spent three days in jail before her $500,000 bond was posted, and the charges were ultimately dropped.",
      "While Texas has one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, it's not a crime for a woman to obtain or seek abortion care for herself. The state's restrictions on abortion target physicians and those who aid a woman in obtaining or seeking an abortion, whether it's surgical or induced by use of abortion drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "According to new filings in the lawsuit made last week, District Attorney Gocha Ramirez dropped the charges against Gonzalez after public outcry over Gonzalez's arrest. Included in an exhibit in the lawsuit was a text Ramirez wrote to his son, in which he admitted he'd made a mistake and even called Gonzalez to apologize, stating he \"didn't know what happened.\"",
      "In the most detailed account to date of the events surrounding Gonzalez's arrest, her attorneys laid out in the 70-page lawsuit the events that they say led the Starr County district attorney, the assistant D.A. and the sheriff to pursue a case against her, even though records suggest prosecutors knew her actions did not violate state law.",
      "\"They should have known from the very beginning that the conduct that they were investigating was not going to ever equal probable cause for homicide,\" said Lauren Johnson, director of the Abortion Criminal Defense Initiative at the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The penal code is very clear that a pregnant person cannot be charged with \u2014 cannot be guilty of a crime, of a homicide, for ending a pregnancy themselves.\"",
      "According to the original complaint filed in March 2024, Gonzalez says she went to an emergency room in January 2022 after taking misoprostol, an abortion-inducing medication.",
      "Less than an hour after she was discharged, she returned to the hospital with complaints of abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. After an exam detected no fetal cardiac activity, doctors performed a cesarean section to deliver a stillborn fetus.",
      "After the procedure, a nurse at the hospital called 911 and reported the procedure to local police, who then contacted the Starr County Sheriff's Office. The nurse later said the hospital's administrators directed her to report the incident \"because, she said, abortions could now be considered murder due to a 'change in the law,'\" according to the complaint.",
      "\"It is not an overstatement to say that Lizelle's life was entirely upended by what happened to her,\" said Johnson, who is representing Gonzalez in the lawsuit. \"She wanted to live her life and didn't want to be criminalized and have her mugshot in her local community. And have something that should have been a very personal decision be something that was made public.\"",
      "In July, the Southern District Court of Texas denied Starr County officials' attempts to have the lawsuit dismissed after the prosecutors and sheriff raised claims of absolute and qualified immunity, respectively. The immunity doctrine has been developed by the courts to restrict legal liability of government officials, such as law enforcement, judges and prosecutors. Absolute immunity applies a complete shield from legal action regardless of the legality or constitutionality of the official's actions. Qualified immunity however can not shield a government actor, like law enforcement, if they violate \"clearly established\" statutory or constitutional rights.",
      "However, the court filings allege that all three county officials named in the suit \u2014 Ramirez, first assistant prosecutor Alexandria Barrera and Sheriff Rene Fuentes \u2014 violated \"clearly established\" constitutional rights when they pursued a murder charge and arrest for an action the law clearly states is not a crime. And they allege that the prosecutors acted outside of their prosecutorial capacity by directing the investigation and providing legal advice to drive the indictment\u00a0 \u2014 which Gonzalez argues would exempt them from any immunity.",
      "The A.C.L.U. says the hundreds of pages of evidence it has gathered contradict the claim by county officials that they didn't know that it was not lawful to pursue a murder charge against Gonzalez. In a sworn deposition, an investigator with the sheriff's office testified that she wasn't ready to charge Gonzalez with murder but was instructed to do so by Barrera.",
      "\"No practices have been put in place or conduct changed to prevent something like this from happening or being done differently in the future,\" says Johnson. \"I think that part has been especially alarming and really does highlight the need for ways to shine a light on this conduct and also really force elected officials to follow the law when they're using the immense power that they have.\"",
      "The Starr County District Attorney's office has not yet responded to a request for comment.",

    "summary": "Jinchao Wei, who was an active-duty sailor stationed in San Diego, was found guilty of charges he sold military secrets to China.",
    "story": [
      "A U.S. Navy sailor was convicted Wednesday of charges that he sold military secrets, including details about military warships, to a Chinese intelligence officer while on active duty in exchange for payment.",
      "Jinchao Wei, also known as Patrick Wei, who was an active-duty sailor stationed at Naval Base San Diego, was found guilty by a jury in federal court in San Diego of six counts. The charges on which he was convicted include conspiracy to commit espionage, espionage, and unlawful export of technical data about U.S. defense vehicles in exchange for $12,000.",
      "Wei was a machinist's mate in the U.S.S. Essex, an amphibious assault ship, and held a security clearance that gave him access to sensitive national security defense information about the ship's operations and capabilities.",
      "Federal prosecutors alleged that Wei was approached in February 2022 over social media by someone who claimed to be a naval enthusiast, but in reality was a Chinese intelligence officer. Between the time of their first encounter and Wei's arrest in August 2023, Wei sent photographs, videos and information about the ship's weapons to his handler, in addition to information about ship movement and the potential vulnerabilities of the vessels. Wei also sent information about other Navy ships that he had taken from restricted computer systems. He was paid $12,000 over that period by the Chinese agent.",
      "Prosecutors also presented evidence that Wei and the Chinese agent tried to cover up their communications. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Southern California, Wei used encrypted apps and created multiple online accounts to receive payments from his Chinese handler, whom he referred to as \"Big Brother Andy.\" Prosecutors said Wei used digital \"dead drops\" and a computer and phone that were provided by the agent.",
      "When Wei began providing the handler with information, he told another U.S. Navy sailor that he had been asked to spy for the Chinese government, the U.S. Attorney's Office said.",
      "After he was arrested, Wei was asked by FBI investigators to describe his actions involving the Chinese intelligence agent.",
      "\"Espionage,\" he responded, according to prosecutors. They said Wei, during that interview also told investigators, \"I'm screwed.\"",
      "\"The defendant, who took an oath to protect our Nation and was entrusted with a security clearance as a petty officer in the United States Navy, sold out his country for $12,000,\" Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg said in a statement. \"He violated his oath, betrayed his uniform and fellow sailors, and turned his back on his adopted nation for money. This verdict serves as a warning to those who do not take seriously the solemn obligations of their positions of trust or their duty to this Nation. Do not be tempted by easy money because you will be prosecuted and sent to prison.\"",
      "Wei is scheduled to be sentenced on Dec. 1. The maximum penalty for the charges is life in prison.",
      "Wei's lawyer, Sean Jones, said in a statement to CBS News,\"It was never disputed that Jinchao made numerous errors in judgment. He was young and naive and regrettably agreed to share some very low level information in exchange for easy money.\"",
      "He said Wei \"loves America\" and \"has no allegiance to China,\" and believed he was selling the information to someone for \"the apparent personal or professional benefit of the recipient,\" and not for the benefit of China. Jones said the information Wei sold consisted of \"outdated maintenance manuals to a broken and obsolete steam powered ship.\" Jones added that he believes Wei's actions had \"absolutely no effect on national security\" and expressed hope that \"given the substantial mitigating factors he will receive a fair sentence.\"",
      "The Chinese official's successful spying efforts are viewed as part of a developing area\u00a0in Chinese covert activities that counterintelligence officials are calling \"virtual espionage.\" The practice \u2014 in which Chinese intelligence officers target members of the military and others of high interest on social media, draw them into correspondence, and extract sensitive information from them \u2014 is seen as a rising threat, officials told CBS News.",
      "In March, two active-duty U.S. soldiers and one former soldier were arrested after being accused of selling state secrets to foreign countries, including China, the Justice Department announced.",
      "In a separate case from 2024, another U.S. Navy petty officer pleaded guilty to handing over sensitive information about the U.S. military after he was contacted in a stock trading chat group on the Chinese-owned social media network WeChat.",

    "summary": "A New York appellate court threw out the $527 million penalty in the civil fraud case against President Trump and others on Thursday, ruling that the fine was \"excessive.\"",
    "story": [
      "A panel of justices on a New York appellate court threw out the half-billion-dollar penalty in the civil fraud case against President Trump and others on Thursday, ruling that the fine was \"excessive\" while saying they were divided on the merits of the case.",
      "One of the justices on the Appellate Division, First Judicial Department wrote that the penalty, known as a disgorgement, against Mr. Trump, two of his sons and other executives and their company was \"an excessive fine barred by the Eighth Amendment.\"",
      "In February 2024, a New York judge ordered Mr. Trump and his codefendants to pay the state nearly $364 million in \"ill-gotten gains\" and millions more in interest dating back years, a total that has since ballooned to about $527 million. Judge Arthur Engoron's judgment left Mr. Trump on the hook for nearly 98% of the total.",
      "New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement Thursday that her office will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court. Her statement lauded one aspect of the ruling, which left in place sanctions barring Mr. Trump from serving as an officer or director of any corporation or other legal entity in the state for three years. His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., were banned for two years.",
      "\"The court upheld the injunctive relief we won, limiting Donald Trump and the Trump Organization officers' ability to do business in New York. It should not be lost to history: yet another court has ruled that the president violated the law, and that our case has merit,\" James said.",
      "Mr. Trump hailed the decision in a post on Truth Social, claiming \"TOTAL VICTORY,\" despite the limited nature of the ruling.",
      "\"I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State,\" Mr. Trump wrote.",
      "James first brought the case in 2022, alleging Mr. Trump oversaw a scheme to deliberately mislead companies he was in business with about the values of properties and Mr. Trump's overall net worth.",
      "Mr. Trump's lawyers have long argued that the civil case was driven by politics. But Engoron disagreed, ruling in February 2024 that Trump and his codefendants had misrepresented his wealth and inflated the valuations of his properties by hundreds of millions of dollars over the course of a decade. The state said the scheme was intended to trick banks and insurers into offering more favorable deal terms.",
      "The president appealed the judgment, and the five-justice appellate panel heard arguments in September 2024. At least two of the justices seemed skeptical of the size of the judgment. One called it \"immense\" and \"troubling.\" Mr. Trump was represented during the September proceeding by D. John Sauer, who is now the solicitor general.",
      "The court's ruling",
      "In a complex 323-page series of opinions on Thursday, the justices wrote that they were deeply divided, with two saying a new trial should be ordered and one writing that the case should be tossed altogether. A majority of four justices settled on an alternate path: vacating the massive financial penalty without resolving the merits of the case. The penalty, as one wrote, \"was far from a reasonable approximation\" of the amount that was warranted.",
      "Justice David Friedman, who dissented from the majority, noted that two of the four justices who voted to vacate the penalty \"do not actually agree with the resolution of the appeal for which they are voting.\"",
      "\"I find it remarkable that, although a three-justice majority of this five-justice panel believe that the judgment in favor of the Attorney General should not stand \u2026 the result of the appeal is the affirmance of the judgment, albeit as modified to eliminate the disgorgement award,\" Friedman wrote.",
      "\"To draw a sports analogy, it is as if a team is awarded a touchdown without crossing the goal line,\" he continued.",
      "Justices John Higgitt and Llin\u00e9t Rosado said they would have preferred to order a new trial, but would join the majority \"with great reluctance.\"",
      "\"Under the truly extraordinary circumstances here, where none of the writings enjoys the support of a majority, we are moved to take this action to permit this panel to arrive at a decision and to permit the parties and the Court to avoid the necessity of reargument,\" they wrote. \"We must therefore agree with Justice Friedman in his observation that a remarkable situation has necessitated a remarkable solution.\"",
      "The appellate court typically issues decisions within a few months of arguments, but the intricacy of the legal issues at hand seems to have delayed a final ruling. Sources on both sides of the dispute expressed surprise to CBS News about the length of the wait for a resolution, as the seasons changed and the court drew closer to a year without word from the court.",
      "James' office has defended the punishment, saying it accurately reflected the size of Mr. Trump's profits from fraud.",
      "Engoron wrote in his ruling that documents in evidence prove \"over and over again\" that the defendants falsely inflated Mr. Trump's wealth and reported those fraudulent numbers to business partners.",
      "He said Mr. Trump's \"complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,\" and said his company gave their accountants \"blatantly false financial data.\"",
      "Despite overturning the judgment, the appellate panel concluded that Engoron \"was even-handed at trial, and allowed both sides to 'make their case.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump testified during a bench trial in the case, in November 2023, blaming his employees and others while also insisting his books were kept appropriately. Accused of falsely inflating his wealth, Mr. Trump claimed the opposite was true, saying his company \"underestimated\" the value of his properties.",
      "\"The numbers you are talking about here is, you know, they are very big numbers, very, very big. Far bigger \u2014 the values are far bigger than what is on the financial statement,\" Mr. Trump said, later adding, \"billions of dollars more.\"",
      "Engoron concluded that testimony by Mr. Trump, his sons and other Trump Organization executives was not credible. A majority of the appellate panel agreed with that determination, as well as another related to Mr. Trump's former lawyer and \"fixer\" Michael Cohen, who testified against Mr. Trump.",
      "\"We defer to the court's findings that the testimony of President Trump, Donald Trump, Jr., Eric Trump, Jeffrey McConney and Allen Weisselberg were not credible, and that the testimony of Michael Cohen was credible,\" the court said.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. will impose a 15% tariff on imports of European cars, pharmaceuticals and other products, according to a joint statement issued Thursday by the Trump administration and European Union.",
      "The pact also calls for the 27-member EU to eliminate tariffs on all American industrial exports and to offer preferred terms for some seafood and farm products, while the U.S. will reduce tariffs accordingly.",
      "The new framework, which is an agreement to facilitate trade negotiations between countries rather than a finalized deal, comes after President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met briefly in July at Mr. Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",
      "In the latest pact, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to limit import duties on most European goods, including cars, drugs and semiconductors to no more than 15%, pending additional legislative actions by the EU.",
      "The agreement also covers $750 billion in energy purchases and $600 billion in EU investments by 2028.",
      "\"This Framework Agreement represents a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial trade and investment,\" the White House and EU said in a joint statement. \"This Framework Agreement will put our trade and investment relationship \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 on a solid footing and will reinvigorate our economies' reindustrialization.\"",
      "After the agreement is fully implemented, the average effective U.S. tariff on imports from EU countries will range from 10% to 14%, according to Eurasia Group, a consulting firm focused on political risk. Together, the U.S. and the EU account for 44% of the global economy.",
      "What's inside the framework pact",
      "The framework impacts a broad range of items produced by the U.S. and the EU, ranging from dairy products to lobster. Some of the additional provisions include:",
      "The EU will \"provide preferential market access\" for U.S. agricultural goods and seafood, including dairy products, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soybean oil and pork and bison meat.\u00a0The EU pledged to take steps to extend a 2020 agreement for lobster imports, which had expired in July, including expanding the scope to include processed lobster.The U.S. will reduce tariffs on EU-made automobiles to 15% once the European trading bloc formalizes its elimination of tariffs on all American industrial exports.\u00a0A pledge by the EU to buy at least $40 billion's worth of U.S. AI chips for its computing centers.The EU said it would \"substantially increase procurement of military and defense equipment from the United States, with the support and facilitation of the U.S. government,\" although the framework didn't include a dollar figure for the purchases.The EU and U.S. agreed to streamline requirements for sanitary certificates for pork and dairy products, part of an effort to address nontariff barriers to trade.",

      "\"This is a serious, strategic deal -- and we are fully behind it. A wide range of sectors, including strategic industries such as cars, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber, stand to benefit,\" said the EU trade commissioner Maros Sefcovic.",

    "summary": "The Department of Homeland Security figure comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has declined by 1.6 million since President Trump began his immigration crackdown.",
      "\"This is massive,\" Noem said in a statement, crediting the decline in part to an ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to leave or face arrest and deportation.",
      "\"This new data shows illegal aliens are hearing our message,\" she added. In the Department of Homeland Security's news release, Noem did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported.",
      "But the vast majority would have had to have left without making any contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that it sourced the 1.6 million figure from its own numbers out of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although its news release included a chart from an analysis released earlier this month by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions.",
      "It did not provide additional information on how USCIS calculated this estimate.",
      "Any estimate of the current unauthorized population at this stage comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
      "A new analysis from the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, estimated that there were 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2023. That's the latest year for which data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey is available \u2014 the survey that experts say is the gold standard for making these population estimates.",
      "The Pew Research Center's analysis found that the undocumented immigrant population swelled by 3.5 million from 2021 to 2023, driven largely by recent arrivals during the Biden administration.",
      "It had previously declined by 1.1 million between the start of the Obama administration and the end of the first Trump administration, Pew found.",
      "Meanwhile, the analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies is based on another Census Bureau survey known as the Current Population Survey. The CPS polls about 60,000 households \u2014 about 2% of the size of the American Community Survey's sample \u2014 making some estimates less reliable. Experts also note some immigrants may not respond amid increased enforcement.",
      "The Pew Research Center analyzed the CPS data as well, and found similar results, showing the unauthorized immigrant population may have continued to grow into 2024 and started to decline in 2025.",
      "\"For [20]25, all we have is CPS data and that points to a decline from a January peak of immigrants,\" Jeffrey Passel, the Pew report's lead author, told CBS News. \"How big the decline is could be affected by the decrease in response rates.\"",
      "To estimate the unauthorized population, researchers typically subtract the number of immigrants with legal status from the overall foreign-born population. Estimating the foreign-born population in the absence of the American Community Survey can be tricky.",
      "The Census Bureau, which oversees both surveys, cautions against using the Current Population Survey to estimate the foreign-born populations due to its sample size.",
      "Zooming in on the foreign-born population within the CPS survey makes a small sample size even smaller, introducing wide margins of error, experts say. The foreign-born population makes up about 14% of the total U.S. population, according to the latest ACS survey.",
      "The analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the total foreign-born population, which includes both legal and illegal immigrants, fell by 2.2 million between January and July, including 600,000 non-citizens with legal status.",
      "Steven Camarota, the lead author on that analysis, said the decline in the overall foreign-born population is statistically significant, or not due to chance, despite the wide margins of error. He noted that response rates have declined for more than a decade, but haven't prevented the survey from tracking the previous increases in the foreign-born population prior to January 2025.",
      "Data is not available on the response rates among foreign-born people compared with U.S.-born people surveyed, so it isn't clear how much of the recent decline in the response rate is reflective of a drop off among immigrants.",
      "\"Given that the foreign-born is a small minority of the population, you can have a meaningful decline in the foreign-born response rate without having much of a decline in the overall response rate,\" Jed Kolko, an economist who served as under secretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Biden Administration, told CBS News.",
      "Still, Kolko said there are other indicators that the unauthorized population has begun to decline. Industries that rely heavily on labor from unauthorized workers, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, have seen greater drops in employment than all other industries, according to his analysis of a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers rather than households.",

    "story": [
      "In the rugged North Cascade Mountains of Washington State, no one likely knows this glacier better than Mauri Pelto, who says, \"My life has been shaped by this ice.\"",
      "For more than 40 years, Pelto, a glaciologist and a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, has returned to this remote wilderness. \"We got 6,000 measurements on this glacier,\" he said.",
      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",
      "Climate scientists say warmer summers and drier winters, driven by our burning of fossil fuels, are accelerating the loss. Seven of the 10 worst years for glacier melt worldwide have happened since 2010, according to Climate Central.",
      "Or just ask Mauri Pelto where the ice used to be. \"Almost 50 feet above my head just a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "Glaciers are Earth's water towers, storing 70% of the freshwater supply, vital for drinking, farming, and the health of many ecosystems. As they melt, sea levels are rising, and coastal flooding is getting worse.",
      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/spacex-launches-unpiloted-x-37b-rocket-plane-on-classified-space-force-mission/",
    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 01:01:00 -0400",
    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "story": [
      "If you look up at the sky in Texas and see what could be a flying burrito, you may not be imagining things: Chipotle on Thursday launched an autonomous aerial delivery service for digital orders in the Dallas area.",
      "Through a partnership with Zipline, a drone delivery and logistics provider, Chipotle is introducing Zipotle, new delivery service for its customers. With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "\"If you keep at it and say, 'no, you're wrong. You're wrong' \u2014 eventually AI will say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' Doing that with your class can show you that AI isn't really as smart as you think it is,\" Ong said.",

    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from Putnam County Jail in Tennessee on Friday and has been reunited with his family while he awaits trial, according to his attorney.",
      "It's the latest development in the case of a man who was mistakenly removed from the U.S. to an El Salvador prison where he\u00a0alleges he was tortured. Initially detained by immigration officials in March before being sent to El Salvador,\u00a0Abrego Garcia\u00a0returned to the U.S. in June to face criminal charges that were filed in Tennessee. The Justice Department has accused him of smuggling and gang membership, allegations his family denies. He pleaded not guilty to\u00a0two criminal counts\u00a0of human smuggling last month.",
      "\"For the first time since March, our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia is reunited with his loving family,\" attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"While his release brings some relief, we all know that he is far from safe. ICE detention or deportation to an unknown third country still threatens to tear his family apart. A measure of justice has been done, but the government must stop pursuing actions that would once again separate this family.\"",
      "A federal magistrate had ordered Abrego Garcia to be released from jail while he awaits trial, currently scheduled for January. He is expected to have to wear an electronic monitoring device.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a delay of his release from jail in Tennessee earlier this summer, fearing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could immediately detain him and try to deport him again. Last month, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that the government must return Abrego Garcia to supervised release under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore, re-implementing a 2019 order.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia, who is Salvadoran, had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador. The judge also ruled that Abrego Garcia must receive 72 hours' notice if the Trump administration plans to deport him anywhere other than his country of origin, El Salvador.",

    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value after its stock plunged Thursday following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 billion in its capitalization.",
      "The slide appeared to be halted on Friday, with Cracker Barrel's shares up roughly one point, or 1.3%, as of 12:03 p.m. EST.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",

The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",

      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",

      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",

      "National Guard personnel have been deployed in D.C. since\u00a0last week, when Mr. Trump ordered the D.C. Guard to crack down on\u00a0what he has called\u00a0an \"epidemic of crime.\" Federal agents have also patrolled the city, and the president has asserted control over the local Metropolitan Police Department.",
      "It was unclear if the guard's role in the federal intervention could be changing. The troops have not taken part in law enforcement and largely have been protecting landmarks including the National Mall and Union Station and helping with crowd control.",
      "Some troops have fed squirrels. One Guard member helped a woman carry her belongings down the stairs in a train station. Others have been seen taking photos with passers-by, standing around chatting and drinking coffee. There have been no overt indications they have faced threats that would require weapons.",
      "On Thursday, Mr. Trump visited a U.S. Park Police facility in southeast D.C., and handed out hamburgers and pizza as he thanked federal law enforcement. A day before, Hegseth as well as Vice President JD Vance and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller visited National Guard members at Union Station.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted that people he knows feel safer than before in the city, but local officials say the initiative is unnecessary. After spiking in 2023, violent crime in D.C.\u00a0has been declining\u00a0for the last year and a half, according to local police data. Mr. Trump has claimed that crime is on the upswing.",
      "The city's police department and the offices of Mayor Muriel Bowser and Attorney General Brian Schwalb did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The city had been informed about the intent for the National Guard to be armed, a person familiar with the conversations said earlier this week. The person was not authorized to disclose the plans and spoke on the condition of anonymity.",

    "summary": "Environmentalists say one solution to beating the heat in sprawling cities is planting more trees or creating green spaces like parks.",
    "story": [
      "Keith Lambert and his family cope with the extreme heat of summertime Chicago by going in and out of their house as quickly as possible and making sure their insulated shades are always drawn.",
      "\"It's really just minimizing the exposure,\" Lambert said. \"Its about doing your best to manage your cooling touch points.\"",
      "Lambert is like tens of millions of Americans navigating major heat waves, with temperatures consistently exceeding 90 degrees Fahrenheit. More often than not, the heat hits hardest for people of color and low-income residents, although Lambert and his family consider themselves middle class.",
      "\"The reality is there is a financial tie as to your comfort level and your well-being when it comes to extreme heat conditions,\" Lambert said. \"If you don't have the means and/or effort to cool, you have three choices: you bake, you're suffering and dealing with it, or do the best to go out and find places that have air conditioning.\"",
      "Mortality records from cities across the country have shown that heat kills along socioeconomic and racial lines. A recent study from Caltech found residents of low-income neighborhoods are bearing the brunt of the hotter temperatures.",
      "Environmental justice advocates trace this inequality back to decades of discriminatory housing policy, especially redlining \u2014 the 1930s government practice of rating neighborhoods' investment worthiness using race as a determining factor and denying mortgages to minority buyers.",
      "\"The redlining and all of the historic environmental injustices that happens to black and brown communities in this country are now coming to a head because its impacting everyone,\" said Alicia White, founder of Project Petals an environmental nonprofit that serves Black and brown communities.",
      "\"It's impacting our communities the most,\" White said.",
      "Extreme heat prompts need for green spaces",
      "The extreme heat isn't just uncomfortable; it's the\u00a0top cause of weather-related fatalities nationwide. According to\u00a0a New York City mortality report, extreme heat kills an average of 350 New Yorkers each year. While heat waves are \"incredibly deadly,\" according to Eric Klinenberg, a sociology professor at New York University, they are also \"largely ignored.\" Heat is invisible and makes for less spectacular imagery than hurricanes or floods.",
      "\"But also the people heat waves affect are often made invisible in our public life,\" said Klinenberg, the author of \"Heat Wave: A Social Autopsy of Disaster in Chicago.\" \"They're disproportionately poor, Black and elderly. They often live in segregated neighborhoods.\"",
      "Environmentalists say one solution to beating the heat in sprawling cities is planting more trees, creating green spaces like parks and meadows and covering rooftops with plants.",
      "In Arizona, the nonprofit Unlimited Potential, which focuses on promoting health and wellness, maintains a program to develop the urban forestry workforce to grow and maintain the tree canopy in Phoenix.",
      "Tawsha Trahan, director of healthy communities at Unlimited Potential, said growing the tree canopy in Phoenix, especially in low-income neighborhoods is needed as the lack of trees contribute to their hotter temperatures.",
      "\"(There) are many reasons that contribute to having hotter neighborhoods but one of those reasons is they simply have much less trees,\" Trahan said. \"It's visual. You can drive around in a neighborhood and see a substantial difference with the tree canopy cover.\"",
      "Last fall, the New York City Council passed laws\u00a0adding trees\u00a0to the city charter's sustainability plans and\u00a0requiring the city to develop an urban forest plan\u00a0to increase tree cover from 22-30% by 2035. Still many predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods do not have green spaces within a five mile radius.",
      "White, the Project Petals founder, said her organization is working to change that by providing the communities with resources they need to create green spaces, such as community gardens. Since 2015, Project Petals has helped open 10 green spaces, ranging from a quarter of an acre to five acres.",
      "\"These spaces really help to filter our air and they lower our temperature,\" White said.",
      "But these spaces, like one in the Jamaica section of Queens with its abundant greenery, aren't just an area to cool down or find shade. They are a place where community can grow. White said you can often find residents and volunteers sitting down for conversation, finding a quiet space to read a book, studying for school and growing their own food.",
      "\"In a place like New York, we are called the concrete jungle, (some) people don't have access to green spaces at all,\" White said.",
      "Green spaces are also beneficial for\u00a0children in school. An estimated 28 million kids in the U.S. don't have easy access to parks or green spaces, according to Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit.",
      "Blacktops\u00a0absorb and trap heat, and can reach up to 145 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "Ways heat data helps cities cope",
      "With increasing temperatures and development patterns, experts say its only going to get hotter, unless something is done. Some are using data as a way to alert communities to the growing dangers.",
      "For example, Kevin Lanza, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at UTHealth Houston School of Public Health in Austin, is helping cities mitigate heat exposure at bus stops. Because Texas's communities of color rely heavily on public transportation systems, this increases their exposure to heat, Lanza said.",
      "In 2019, Lanza's study found that the hottest days saw lower bus ridership. But when the bus stops were shaded by trees, the area was twice as cool and prevented steep ridership lost. The findings prompted the Houston transit authority, METRO and other agencies to begin work to redesign their bus stops to provide relief from the heat, Lanza said.",
      "As of June, according to reporting from Houston Public Media, six shelters have been redesigned to allow more airflow, with more stops expected to be replaced over the next six months.",
      "In 2023, Cap Metro, the transit authority in Austin, also used Lanza's study to develop\u00a0a plan\u00a0to mitigate heat impacts by planting more tree across the city and near existing bus stops.",
      "How a climate dashboard helps communities",
      "Julia Silver, a lifelong resident of California, used to spend her summers with her family at an outdoor public pool. Now, amid record-breaking heat waves, Silver and her family have spent the majority of the summer inside their Los Angeles home, the local mall or other air-conditioned facilities.",
      "\"It's just kind of become unbearable during those hot summer days to spend time outside,\" said Silver, a researcher at the UCLA Latino Policy and Politics Institute.",
      "In June, Institute launched a\u00a0Latino Climate and Health Dashboard, which creates a centralized source that shows the climate disparities Latino neighborhoods across California. Developed with guidance from a statewide advisory committee of climate justice, public health, and data equity experts, the dashboard shows 90% of California's Latino population faces climate inequities, from higher air pollution to more days of extreme heat than white residents.",
      "\"The disparities shown in the dashboard are not random,\" said Silver, a senior research analyst at the LLPI and the project's leader.",
      "Silver said the main purpose of the dashboard is to ensure local leaders, community groups, government agencies and others have access to trustworthy data that reflects the experience communities in California and so many other states are facing.",
      "\"The more climate change intensifies the more difficult it is for people to live, and the more dangerous it is for people to be outside,\" Silver said.",
      "The dashboard will help create a shift to more inclusive climate planning by helping organizations understand who is most affected and where the greatest needs are.",
      "\"By shining a light on these patterns, we can start correcting them,\" said Arturo Vargas Bustamante, research faculty director at LPPI and principal investigator for the project.",

      "The August 2023 wildfire that swept across the old whaling city killed more than 100 people and destroyed countless homes. Among the losses was the century-old King Kamehameha III Elementary School, leaving hundreds of children without their familiar learning environment.",
      "Now operating from a temporary campus on the doorstep of the Maui Nature Reserve, the school represents the fourth different location students have called home since the fires. FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers constructed the temporary facility in less than 90 days.",
      "For educators like Janeen Tempo, who has taught at the school for more than a decade, and educational assistant Darice Garcia, both Maui natives, helping students process trauma became as important as traditional lessons.",
      "\"In the early days, I would hear the kids make comments. 'Oh, my house is gone or my cousin died,'\" Garcia said.",
      "The shared experience of loss created unexpected bonds between teachers and students. Tempo found herself relating to children who had lost their homes.",
      "\"I have had students, oh, you know, my house burned down. I go, I'm sorry. Mine too,\" Tempo said. \"And just I think for them, knowing that somebody's in the same situation just kind of alleviates some of their fear.\"",
      "Despite the trauma they faced, educators said they were struck by their students' resilience.",
      "\"There are times where the kids actually helped me out more than\u00a0 I helped them out,\" Tempo said. \"I felt like they were more resilient than I was sometimes because they would come to school and they'd be eager to learn.

      "Despite mounting pressure from President Trump, the Fed has held off on cutting rates this year as it monitors the impact of Trump administration's tariffs on inflation and the labor market. Powell's speech on Friday, however, may be the strongest indication yet that policy changes could be afoot.",

      "On Friday, Powell noted that job force growth has \"slowed considerably\" and that the \"downside risks to employment are rising.\" Job growth came in weaker than expected in July, with employers adding 73,000 jobs. The Labor Department also revised job growth\u00a0sharply down for May and June.",

      "The Women's National Basketball Association has officially broken its single-season attendance record, attracting upwards of 2.5 million fans to games around the country so far this year, the league announced Thursday.",
      "The new record, set on Wednesday, accounts for crowds that attended 226 WNBA games in 2025 involving 13 teams, according to a social media post shared by the WNBA. The previous record, set in 2002, was reached after considerably more games \u2014 256 \u2014 and involved more teams \u2014 16 teams \u2014 than the new record.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said last week that the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. has declined by 1.6 million since President Trump began his immigration crackdown.",
      "\"This is massive,\" Noem said in a statement, crediting the decline in part to an ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to leave or face arrest and deportation.",
      "\"This new data shows illegal aliens are hearing our message,\" she added. In the Department of Homeland Security's news release, Noem did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported.",
      "But the vast majority would have had to have left without making any contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that it sourced the 1.6 million figure from its own numbers out of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although its news release included a chart from an analysis released earlier this month by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions.",
      "It did not provide additional information on how USCIS calculated this estimate.",
      "Any estimate of the current unauthorized population at this stage comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
      "A new analysis from the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, estimated that there were 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2023. That's the latest year for which data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey is available \u2014 the survey that experts say is the gold standard for making these population estimates.",
      "The Pew Research Center's analysis found that the undocumented immigrant population swelled by 3.5 million from 2021 to 2023, driven largely by recent arrivals during the Biden administration.",
      "It had previously declined by 1.1 million between the start of the Obama administration and the end of the first Trump administration, Pew found.",
      "Meanwhile, the analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies is based on another Census Bureau survey known as the Current Population Survey. The CPS polls about 60,000 households \u2014 about 2% of the size of the American Community Survey's sample \u2014 making some estimates less reliable. Experts also note some immigrants may not respond amid increased enforcement.",
      "The Pew Research Center analyzed the CPS data as well, and found similar results, showing the unauthorized immigrant population may have continued to grow into 2024 and started to decline in 2025.",
      "\"For [20]25, all we have is CPS data and that points to a decline from a January peak of immigrants,\" Jeffrey Passel, the Pew report's lead author, told CBS News. \"How big the decline is could be affected by the decrease in response rates.\"",
      "To estimate the unauthorized population, researchers typically subtract the number of immigrants with legal status from the overall foreign-born population. Estimating the foreign-born population in the absence of the American Community Survey can be tricky.",
      "The Census Bureau, which oversees both surveys, cautions against using the Current Population Survey to estimate the foreign-born populations due to its sample size.",
      "Zooming in on the foreign-born population within the CPS survey makes a small sample size even smaller, introducing wide margins of error, experts say. The foreign-born population makes up about 14% of the total U.S. population, according to the latest ACS survey.",
      "The analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the total foreign-born population, which includes both legal and illegal immigrants, fell by 2.2 million between January and July, including 600,000 non-citizens with legal status.",
      "Steven Camarota, the lead author on that analysis, said the decline in the overall foreign-born population is statistically significant, or not due to chance, despite the wide margins of error. He noted that response rates have declined for more than a decade, but haven't prevented the survey from tracking the previous increases in the foreign-born population prior to January 2025.",
      "Data is not available on the response rates among foreign-born people compared with U.S.-born people surveyed, so it isn't clear how much of the recent decline in the response rate is reflective of a drop off among immigrants.",
      "\"Given that the foreign-born is a small minority of the population, you can have a meaningful decline in the foreign-born response rate without having much of a decline in the overall response rate,\" Jed Kolko, an economist who served as under secretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Biden Administration, told CBS News.",
      "Still, Kolko said there are other indicators that the unauthorized population has begun to decline. Industries that rely heavily on labor from unauthorized workers, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, have seen greater drops in employment than all other industries, according to his analysis of a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers rather than households.",

    "story": [
      "The Gaza Strip's largest city is now gripped by famine, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that famine was occurring in Gaza City and that this was likely to spread to the southern cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups and food security experts have warned for months that Gaza was on the brink of famine, but the IPC report is the first official declaration that the situation has reached this level. Israel immediately rejected the IPC's assessment, with the foreign ministry repeating bluntly a claim it has made for months, that \"there is no famine in Gaza.\"",
      "But the IPC \u2014 which is comprised of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid groups, governments and other bodies and was first set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia \u2014 said it had concluded based on \"reasonable evidence\" that famine \"is confirmed in Gaza Governorate.\"",
      "\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation, destitution and death,\" the group said, warning that 1.07 million more people in Gaza were currently in a slightly lower starvation risk category, and that the circumstances were likely to expand within the densely populated Palestinian territory.",

Acute malnutrition is projected to continue worsening rapidly.\"",

      "In a separate statement, Tom Fletcher, who heads the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid had caused the famine in Gaza.",
      "\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" Fletcher told reporters in Geneva, calling it \"a famine that will and must haunt us all.\"",
      "Israel insists \"there is no famine in Gaza\"",
      "In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry categorically rejected the findings of the UN-backed report.",
      "\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" the ministry said, accusing the IPC of presenting a report \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests.\"",
      "\"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets,\" the ministry said.",
      "While more humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza in recent weeks, as Israel has come under intense international pressure, aid organizations say it is nowhere near the amount required. A controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid distribution group has also come under sharp criticism over the killing of numerous civilians near its four distribution hubs in Gaza.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the IPC report Friday, dismissing it as \"an outright lie.\"",
      "\"Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation,\" Netanyahu said, repeating the foreign ministry's figures on food aid provided since the war began and the more recent influx.",
      "In a social media post, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee backed Netanyahu's assertion, insisting that \"tons of food has gone into Gaza but Hamas savages stole it, ate lots of it to become corpulent, sold it on black market but they didn't give it to the hostages.\"",
      "What does a famine classification mean?",
      "Famine can appear in pockets, sometimes small ones, and so a formal classification requires caution, food security experts say. The IPC has only confirmed famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and last year in parts of Sudan's western Darfur region.

      "Gaza has posed a major challenge for experts because Israel severely limits access to the territory, making it difficult to gather and confirm data.",
      "In a separate report Friday, the Famine Review Committee, or FRC, said it, too, had concluded there was famine in part of Gaza. The FRC is a group of independent international food security experts regularly consulted by the IPC.",
      "The group acts as an added layer of verification when the data shows there could be famine.",

    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path of Hurricane Erin, the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin continued moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast on Friday, but swimming at many East Coast beaches \"is likely to remain dangerous for a couple more days,\" the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.",
      "Erin is likely to become \"post-tropical\" by tonight as it heads north, while remaining a \"powerful hurricane-force low pressure system through the weekend,\" the center said.",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 1 storm early Friday as it churned over the Atlantic off the central East Coast. It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "As of Friday at 5 a.m. ET, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph and was scampering northeast at 22 mph, according to an advisory from the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was about 435 miles north of Bermuda and 425 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Canada.",
      "A\u00a0Category 1 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 74 mph to 95 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin's center is forecast to pass south of Atlantic Canada today and tonight \"and then race across the north Atlantic waters,\" the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is a \"very large hurricane,\" with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 125 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 370 miles from the center, forecasters said early Friday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of forecast models showed the storm skirting the Caribbean islands in its early days and remaining well off the U.S. East Coast as it moved north and curved back over the Atlantic. It's expected to end up \"stalling or meandering just south of Iceland\" by next week.",
      "Hurricane Erin's effects on the U.S.",
      "Erin was hurrying away from the U.S. East Coast Friday morning, but increased waves and rough surf are expected to contniue from the Mid-Atlantic up into New England into the weekend.",
      "The National Hurricane Center warns of \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" along much of the Eastern Seaboard for the next several days.",
      "Erin brought tropical storm conditions to parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks Thursday. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the high waves and expected flooding. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach. Erin also caused coastal flooding in Virginia, CBS Richmond affiliate WTKR-TV reported.",
      "Farther up the coast,\u00a0the New York City borough of Queens as well as Long Island\u00a0had some flooding. At beaches in the area and along the\u00a0Jersey shore, swimming was prohibited due to the high surf and rip currents. Big waves and whipping winds are also bringing dangerous beach conditions to the Massachusetts coast, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "Many beaches from South Florida up to New England\u00a0took precautions and closed to swimmers.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

    "summary": "An eyewitness told CBS News that American subcontractors at Gaza Humanitarian Foundation sites shot at Palestinians, a claim GHF denies.",
    "story": [
      "Since the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation first began operating nearly three months ago, the U.N. says hundreds of Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces and foreign military contractors at or near its aid sites. CBS News spoke to a new eyewitness who said it's not just the IDF firing at Palestinians, but also personnel hired through American subcontractors to secure GHF sites.",
      "The witness, who we will refer to as Mike, asked CBS News to conceal his identity because he fears reprisal. When Mike was hired by an American logistics company to drive aid trucks in Israel, he said he had no idea he'd be working with the GHF inside Gaza.",
      "The U.S. and Israeli-backed GHF was established to replace the United Nations as the main distributor of aid back in May. In late June, the U.S. State Department approved $30 million for the group, calling its work \"absolutely incredible.\"",
      "Mike secretly recorded videos and shared them with CBS News. You can hear gunfire in the videos, which Mike says was fired at Palestinians seeking aid.",
      "\"It took me two or three days to realize that they were actually shooting at people, they weren't shooting at combatants,\" he said.",
      "When asked by Patta whether he thought they were warning shots, Mike said, \"No, it's indiscriminate.\" He said both the IDF and American security personnel were shooting.",
      "We don't see who is shooting on the videos Mike gave us. But he said there was not a single occasion he observed when there was no shooting, and he was at the brightly illuminated sites on average five days a week for several weeks. CBS News has seen his work schedule, and metadata from his cell phone confirms the dates and times he was in Gaza.",
      "More than 1,800 Palestinians have died trying to get food, at least 1,000 in the vicinity of GHF sites, according to the U.N.'s Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Since GHF started operating aid sites in May, CBS News has reported on near-daily shootings at or near GHF sites, and former U.S. security contractors have spoken out about witnessing gunfire against Palestinian crowds in interviews with news outlets, including The Associated Press.",
      "Mike said Palestinians would gather near the sites hours before they opened to be the first to grab food. He told CBS News he has \"never seen a crowd of people behave with such intensity and such desperation.\"",
      "When asked about the worst thing he experienced, Mike said he was once tasked by the security contractors with cleaning up human and animal remains adjacent to one site while on the job, due to the foul smell emitted by those remains.",
      "\"I struggle to talk about it,\" he said. \"I even feel a bit clammy, and I can feel my chest beating harder. I just shut down really.\"",
      "GHF says the allegations that their contractors have shot aid-seekers and mishandled their remains are \"categorically false\" and \"utterly baseless.\" They criticized CBS News' refusal to provide them with more detailed information about Mike.",
      "Mike said some of the Americans hired to secure the GHF sites made him feel uncomfortable.",
      "\"They would often boast about how many people they've killed, if they've managed to shoot animals,\" he said. \"Or how many birds they'd shot because they were bragging about how good their aim was.\"",
      "Mike is home now and won't be going back.",
      "When asked why he's sharing his experience, he said, \"It just wouldn't sit right with me if I didn't say something. These atrocities don't have to happen.\"",
      "GHF told CBS News that their contractors do not fire on civilians, nor, they say, has anyone been killed by gunfire at a GHF site, not even within sight of a foundation site.\u00a0 And they say they have \"never encountered any situation involving unclaimed bodies\" at or near their sites.",
      "The IDF has categorically denied allegations that it deliberately fires at Palestinian civilians, but told CBS News it is investigating recent reports of harm being done to civilians approaching GHF sites, and said any deviation from the law will result in further action.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 15:47:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",

      "There has been a lot of talk \u2014   outside of Ukraine \u2014 about a peace deal amid Mr. Trump's ramped-up diplomacy. But inside Ukraine, people continue to live and die in a war zone more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Many in the country, like their president, simply don't believe that Putin really wants to end the war. They think he's just playing along with the ceasefire narrative to avoid angering Mr. Trump.",
      "In the meantime, Putin's army continues to expand its massive seizure of territory in eastern Ukraine. The Russian defense ministry claimed Thursday that forces had captured yet another village in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region.",
      "Major Taras Berezovets of the Ukrainian forces told CBS News that even if Putin were to agree to a ceasefire, the Russian leader simply should not be trusted.",
      "\"Absolutely not,\" Berezovets told CBS News. \"He's a cheater, he's a criminal \u2026 and he would never accept the fact that independent Ukraine still exists.\"",
      "That is why Ukraine wants security guarantees \u2014 a promise of protection from the U.S. and its NATO allies in the event Russia should invade again after any eventual ceasefire is implemented.",
      "President Trump has been adamant that such a guarantee would not involve U.S. boots on the ground, and Vice President JD Vance said Wednesday that Europe would have to bear most of the costs.",
      "Getting all sides, including Russia, to agree to those security guarantees may be next to impossible, however. After his meeting with Putin, Mr. Trump met with Zelenskyy and European leaders in Washington to hold separate talks, and said he was working on organizing a direct summit between the Ukrainian and Russian leaders.",
      "But Moscow has downplayed the prospects of a Putin-Zelenskyy summit any time soon, and officials have said Russia should be included in any looming discussions on security guarantees for Ukraine.",
      "In a post on his own social media platform, Mr. Trump said Thursday \u2014 without mentioning the latest violence in the war \u2014 that it was \"very hard, if not impossible, to win a war without attacking an invaders country. ... There is no chance of winning! It is like that with Ukraine and Russia.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said his predecessor, Joe Biden \"would not let Ukraine FIGHT BACK, only DEFEND.\" He added, without any further explanation, that there were \"Interesting times ahead!!!\"",
      "In November, just weeks before he handed the presidency back to Mr. Trump, Biden\u00a0changed the longstanding policy that had effectively barred Ukraine from using U.S.-supplied missiles to strike deep in Russia.",
      "The French government issued a statement Thursday condemning the latest Russian missile and drone attack on Ukraine, and backing Zelenskyy's assertion that it belied Putin's stated interest in a peace agreement.",
      "\"While Russia claims to be ready to negotiate, it continues at the same time its deadly attacks on Ukrainian territory,\" said the statement, attributed to a deputy spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry. \"These attacks, the most massive in a month, illustrate Russia's lack of any genuine intention to engage seriously in peace talks. They once again underscore the urgent need to put an end to the killings, and therefore to maintain and step up pressure on Russia. France reiterates its support for President Trump's initiative in favor of a just and lasting peace and will continue to work with determination alongside Ukraine and its partners.\"",

The suspect, partially named as Serhii K., is accused of being part of a group \"who placed explosive devices on the Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2 gas pipelines,\" the prosecutors said.",
      "He is \"believed to have been one of the coordinators of the operation,\" they added.",
      "The Nord Stream pipelines connecting Russia and Germany via the Baltic Sea were damaged in September 2022 by huge underwater explosions, believed to be an act of sabotage.",
      "In the years since the mysterious explosions, Ukraine and Russia have both vehemently denied any involvement.",
      "German media have reported the investigation pointed to a Ukrainian cell of five men and one woman who had chartered the yacht \"Andromeda\" from the port of Rostock and carried out the attack.",
      "Their aim was to destroy the pipelines to prevent battlefield enemy Russia from profiting in future from gas sales to Europe, according to Der Spiegel and other media.",
      "Serhii K. was arrested in the early hours of Thursday in the Italian province of Rimini, the German prosecutors said. He and his accomplices are accused of using a yacht that departed Rostock to carry out the attack, they said.",
      "\"The yacht had previously been rented from a German company with the help of forged identity documents obtained through intermediaries,\" they added.",
      "The news of the arrest comes about one year after German media reported that a European arrest warrant had been requested for another Ukrainian man, a diving instructor whose last known address was in Poland, in connection with the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines.",
      "The Polish prosecutor's office told AFP in August 2024 that it had received the warrant for the man \u2014 identified only as \"Volodymyr Z.\" \u2014 a couple months earlier \"in connection with proceedings against him in Germany.\"",

      "The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, a White House official confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday, confirming a report by the Reuters news agency.",
      "The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson were to depart for the region over the next few days, the official said.",
      "A Defense Department official confirmed to The Associated Press that the military assets had been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed \"over the course of several months.\"",
      "The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Mr. Trump pushes for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities, and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
      "The press office of Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment from the AP on the deployment of the U.S. destroyers. But without mentioning the ships, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Tuesday, dismissed the Trump administration's drug-trafficking accusations against Venezuela.",
      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",
      "On Monday, Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced the planned deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.",
      "\"The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,\" Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.",
      "Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. The U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest at the time.",

    "story": [
      "Abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in Antarctica driven by climate change could lift global oceans by meters and lead to \"catastrophic consequences for generations,\" scientists warned Wednesday.",
      "More broadly, a state-of-knowledge review by a score of top experts revealed accelerating shifts across the region that are often both a cause and effect of global warming, according to a study published in Nature, a peer-reviewed international scientific journal.",
      "The study's authors suggest that limiting\u00a0CO2 emissions, and in turn preventing global warming from exceeding at least 1.5 degrees Celsius, \"will be imperative\" to reduce and prepare for the broad effects of abrupt Antarctic and Southern Ocean changes.",
      "\"Antarctica is showing worrying signs of rapid change across its ice, ocean and ecosystems,\" lead author and Australian National University professor Nerilie Abram told the Agence France-Presse. \"Some of these abrupt changes will be difficult to stop.\"",
      "Shifts in different facets of Antarctica's climate system amplify each other and have accelerated the pace of warming globally as well, Abram said.",
      "The study looked at evidence of abrupt change \u2014 or \"regime shifts\" \u2014 in sea ice, regional ocean currents, the continent's ice sheet and ice shelves, and marine life. It also examined how they interact.",
      "Floating sea ice does not significantly add to sea level when it melts, but its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the sun's energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead.",
      "Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.",
      "Retreating sea ice",
      "After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.",
      "Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers, or roughly 75 miles, from the continent's shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.",
      "By July 2025, daily sea ice extent in both hemispheres was at its third lowest in the 47-year satellite record, according to the\u00a0National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Data from NASA, released in 2020, indicated that Antarctica and Greenland had lost thousands of gigatons of ice between 2003 and 2019, indirectly contributing to more than half an inch of overall sea level rise around the world.",
      "Last September, scientists warned that the Antarctic Ice Sheet, officially called the Thwaites Glacier, would deteriorate \"further and faster,\" with the increased melting expected to trigger rising sea levels. Research conducted by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a collective of more than 100 scientists, found that the volume of water flowing into the sea from the Thwaites glacier and others nearby had doubled from the 1990s to the 2010s.",
      "The \"overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice\" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the recent study published Wednesday in Nature found.",
      "This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction, experts warned.",
      "Over the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.",
      "Of five sites monitored in the Bellingshausen Sea region in 2023, all but one experienced a 100% loss of chicks, earlier research reported.",
      "Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on \u2014 or supported by \u2014 land.",
      "The world would need to heat up by 5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels to melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which would lift global oceans an almost unimaginable 58 meters, or nearly 200 feet.",
      "Point of no return",
      "Global warming to date \u2014 on average about 1.3 degrees Celsius \u2014 is fast approaching a threshold that would cause part of the ice sheet to generate at least three meters of sea level rise, flooding coastal areas inhabited today by hundreds of millions, the study said.",
      "\"Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,\" said Abram.",
      "\"The evidence points to this being triggered at global warming well below 2\u00b0C.\"",
      "Another potential risk is the collapse of the Antarctic Overturning Circulation, a system of ocean currents that distribute heat and nutrients within the the region and globally.",
      "A \"rapid and substantial slowdown\" of the currents has already begun, and evidence from the previous interglacial period \u2014 between two ice ages \u2014 before our own, 125,000 years ago, points to an abrupt stagnation of the system under conditions similar to those seen today.",
      "\"This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,\" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.",
      "Ultimately, the only way to slow down the interlocking changes is to stop adding more planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"The greenhouse gas emission decisions that we make over the coming decade or two will lock in how much ice we will lose and how quickly it will be lost,\" Abram said.",

      "Trading in rhino horns is legal in South Africa among citizens, but local laws do not allow for their export due to an international ban.",
      "The investigation by the country's specialized Hawks police unit \"is a powerful demonstration of South Africa's resolve to protect its natural heritage,\" Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment Dion George said in a statement. \"The Hawks' work shows that our enforcement agencies will not hesitate to pursue those who plunder our wildlife for criminal profit.\"",
      "Among the six suspects is John Hume, the former owner of the world's largest rhino conservation farm. The 19,270-acre \"Platinum Rhino\" site in a northern province of South Africa was bought by the African Parks NGO in 2023 and is home to around 2,000 animals, about 15% of the world's remaining wild population of southern white rhino.",
      "Hume, in his mid 80s, and the five others appeared in a magistrate's court in the capital Pretoria and were granted bail, a spokesperson for the Hawks told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "Zimbabwe-born Hume sparked controversy in 2017 by organizing a three-day online auction of horns he had amassed by sawing them off the rhinos in order to prevent their killing by poachers, though the sale attracted fewer buyers than anticipated.",
      "Once abundant across sub-Saharan Africa, rhino numbers fell dramatically due to hunting by European colonizers and large-scale poaching, with their horns highly sought after on black markets, particularly in Asia, where the price by weight rivals that of gold and cocaine.",
      "Alongside ivory, the horns are coveted as status symbols or used in traditional medicine for their supposed aphrodisiac properties.",
      "The organization Save the Rhino praised the arrests on Tuesday.",
      "\"Disrupting transnational organised crime is essential to stopping poaching, allowing populations to recover and ensuring rhinos have a future in the wild,\" the group's CEO, Jo Shaw, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be the first face-to-face interaction between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "Asked about arranging the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Fox & Friends that he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, saying \"they haven't been exactly best friends.\"",
      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said. Politico first reported that Budapest was under consideration to host the talks.",
      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",
      "Leavitt outlined Mr. Trump's position Tuesday afternoon, saying \"the president has definitely stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.\"",
      "\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to secure a lasting peace and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe,\" she added.",

      "\"We are in a situation where literally hundreds of thousands of Canadians and visitors to our country are being disrupted by this action,\" Prime Minister Mark Carney said. \"I urge both parties to resolve this as quickly as possible.\"",

      "CIRB had first ordered airline staff back to work by 2 p.m. Sunday after the government intervened and Air Canada said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening.",

      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",
      "\"Air Canada's intended restart of Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge, which have been grounded since Aug. 16 by CUPE's labour disruption, was prevented on Aug. 17 by the CUPE leadership's unlawful strike activities,\" Air Canada said in a statement on Monday. \"Air Canada regrets this impact on its customers and is fully committed to returning to service as soon as possible.\"",

      "In November 2023, Judge Joseph Lipner ruled that Gudvi was entitled to the sale of the Montecito home purchased on Perry's behalf in 2020. The trial was split into two parts by the judge. The damages phase took place last year and the penalty phase, which kicked off this week.",
      "On Thursday, Judge Lipner criticized Perry's legal team after its attempt to get the \"Firework\" singer to testify in a Los Angeles court that day, a request to essentially move Perry's testimony up and out of a scheduled order in the six-day trial.",

      "Perry's lawyers noted that the musician preferred to go by her real name, Katheryn Hudson, and apologized for last-minute scheduling concerns, stating they were unaware of the singer's availability due to her demanding tour schedule.",
      "\"That's outrageous \u2026 that she's only allowed to testify today,\" the judge said. \u00a0\"It doesn't reflect well on you, it doesn't reflect well on Ms. Hudson. It's not nice, it's not right.\"",
      "Perry, 40, embarked on The Lifetimes Tour in April, and is scheduled to wrap the U.S. leg on Saturday in Miami, Fl. \"We learned only fairly recently what her availability was,\" Alex Linhardt argued. \"Today and tomorrow and that's probably it.\"",
      "\"They're basically saying she should testify out of order today,\" the judge said before asking Westcott's lawyer, Andrew J. Thomas, what he would like to do, to which Thomas noted he wasn't prepared with such little notice.",
      "\"I can order her back, and if they don't produce her, you can be angry,\" the judge told the court before Thomas asked for 48 hours to prepare to question Perry.",
      "\"I don\u2019t like the strategy/tactics on her side,\" the judge added. \"She may be called back for another hour at a second date,\" he said before opening statements in the case began.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News chief Washington correspondent Mike Emanuel reports on President Donald Trump's goal to put a nuclear reactor on the moon on 'Special Report.'",
      "A Harvard physicist who sounded the alarm earlier this month about a rare interstellar object passing through our solar system \u2014 suggesting it might be more than a comet \u2014 now says it could even be a nuclear-powered spaceship.",
      "The object, 3I/ATLAS, was first detected in early July by an Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) telescope in Chile. It marks only the third time an interstellar object has been observed entering our solar system, according to NASA.",
      "While NASA classified the object as a comet, Dr. Avi Loeb pointed out that an image showed an unexpected glow in front of the object rather than trailing behind it, something he called \"quite surprising.\"",
      "In a blog post this week, Loeb wrote that the object\u2019s brightness profile cannot be explained by sunlight reflection or standard cometary outgassing.",

      "Instead, he suggested, 3I/ATLAS might be generating its own light, possibly from nuclear energy.",
      "\"Alternatively, 3I/ATLAS could be a spacecraft powered by nuclear energy, and the dust emitted from its frontal surface might be from dirt that accumulated on its surface during its interstellar travel,\" Loeb wrote. \"This cannot be ruled out, but requires better evidence to be viable.\"",
      "Loeb dismissed other natural power sources. A primordial black hole, he said, would generate only about 20 nanowatts \u2014 far too weak. A radioactive fragment from a supernova was highly unlikely given its rarity, and frictional heating from interstellar gas and dust was ruled out by momentum and density constraints.",

      "That leaves the simplest explanation \u2014 a central, compact, high-power source. The most natural way to achieve the gigawatt-level luminosity observed, Loeb noted, would be nuclear power.",
      "Still, Loeb does not claim the object is nuclear-powered. He stresses there is only one possible interpretation if natural models fail, and proving it would require more evidence.",
      "3I/ATLAS is estimated to be about 20 kilometers across, larger than Manhattan.",
      "Loeb has also raised questions about its unusual trajectory.",

    "story": [
      "A new report by The Wall Street Journal is warning people to think twice before trusting the 'unsubscribe' option at the bottom of promotional emails.",
      "Over the past year, more people have reported receiving order shipment emails for purchases they never made. These messages usually come from legitimate retailers, often sportswear brands or electronics stores, and contain real tracking numbers and delivery details. The products are being shipped to different names at different addresses, but for some reason, the buyer's contact email is yours.",
      "It might seem like a harmless clerical error or someone accidentally typing the wrong email address. But when it happens repeatedly, and across multiple unrelated orders, it starts to look less like a coincidence and more like a tactic.",

      "Some scammers use valid, active email addresses to bypass retailer fraud filters. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What's likely happening with those shipment emails in your inbox",
      "It is unlikely that someone is accidentally typing your email address every single time. Rather, scammers are deliberately using valid, active email addresses like yours to bypass retailer fraud filters. Numerous sources confirm that fake order and shipping confirmation emails are a common tactic in fraud operations, with criminals exploiting the trust systems placed in legitimate email addresses.",
      "When a stolen credit card is used, pairing it with a real email that has not triggered spam alerts increases the chance the transaction will go unnoticed by anti-fraud systems. Retailers often check whether an email address is active or bounces. If the system sees a functioning address, it may be less suspicious than an obviously fake one.",
      "Once the order is placed, products are frequently sent to drop addresses or freight-forwarding services, as confirmed by official investigations into brushing scams. These services act as intermediaries, making the scam harder to trace. In that context, your email is simply a means to an end, a validated contact point that helps the operation move forward smoothly.",
      "Scammers can obtain email addresses when reputable companies experience data breaches. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How bad actors are able to get your email",
      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service.

If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft at\u00a0\u00a0Cyberguy.com/IdentityTheft",
      "In your email settings (e.g., Gmail, Outlook), check for any connected apps, services or delegated access you don't recognize and remove them. This ensures no third party is piggybacking off your account.",
      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

    "story": [
      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

    "summary": "Ten innovative tech solutions from gait sensors to smart pill dispensers help adults 65+ track fall risks and prevent injuries before they happen.",
    "story": [
      "Murdoch Children's Institute clinical science research director Dr. Vicki Anderson explains how the app will help parents and coaches rapidly assess injuries and determine how to treat them on 'Varney & Co.'",
      "Falls are the number one cause of injury among adults 65 and older. But the truth is, your risk doesn't suddenly appear the day you turn 65. It increases gradually over time, especially if you're dealing with weak muscles, balance issues, side effects from medication, or even just forgetting a pill. Experts recommend that everyone get screened for fall risk at age 65. But you don't have to wait for a doctor's visit to take action. A new wave of technology is giving older adults the power to track, prevent, and respond to fall risks, all from home. Here are 10 smart tools that can help.",

      "New technology can help track and prevent falls. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "1) Gait sensors track how your balance changes over time",
      "Your walking pattern can reveal subtle issues that increase your risk of falling. If you use an iPhone with iOS 15 or newer, the built-in walking steadiness feature in the Health app can rate your balance as OK, low, or very low over time. Android users can use wearable fitness trackers like\u00a0Fitbit, or Samsung Galaxy Watch to gather similar data. These tools track stride, stability, and pressure patterns that help identify balance changes before you feel unsteady.",
      "FORGET 10,000 STEPS \u2014 RESEARCH REVEALS THE REAL NUMBER YOU NEED FOR BETTER HEALTH",
      "What to check:\u00a0On iPhone, open the Health app and review your walking steadiness trends. Android users can check their wearable app dashboards, like Samsung Health or Fitbit, to view step symmetry, cadence, and gait-related data. Look for any changes over weeks or months and take advantage of in-app exercise suggestions to improve balance and strength.",
      "Apps that track physical activity and walking patterns can help users improve their balance and strength, or even detect a change in gait before it becomes an issue. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "2) Smart pill dispensers prevent risky mistakes",
      "Forgetting to take medication, or taking too much, can cause grogginess or dizziness that increases fall risk. A smart pill dispenser helps make sure you take the right dose at the right time.",
      "What to look for: Look for dispensers with reminders, dose tracking, and alerts for missed meds.",
      "Smart pill dispensers can assist patients in making sure they take the correct dose of the desired medication at the right time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3) Fitness trackers keep you motivated to move",
      "Building strength, especially in your legs and core, is one of the best ways to prevent falls. Whether you use an\u00a0Apple Watch, Fitbit or another device, fitness trackers can nudge you toward daily movement goals.",
      "What to check:\u00a0Track your cardio fitness levels, not just step counts. It's a good indicator of your overall strength and endurance.",
      "Fitness tracking devices can help users build strength and resilience. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "4) Vital-sign monitors help detect lightheaded spells",
      "Dips in blood pressure or oxygen levels can make you feel woozy, which increases your fall risk.\u00a0Smartwatches and fingertip pulse oximeters help you monitor these changes in real time.",
      "What to check:\u00a0If you're not using a wearable, jot down your daily readings with a standard cuff or oximeter to spot any unusual trends.",
      "5) Motion-activated lighting lights the way",
      "Getting up in the middle of the night without enough light is a common recipe for a fall. Motion-activated lights can illuminate your path without you needing to touch a switch.",
      "What to look for: Try plug-in nightlights that turn on when they sense motion, or during a power outage. Some even double as portable flashlights.",
      "NEW MOBILE ROBOT HELPS SENIORS WALK SAFELY AND PREVENT FALLS",
      "6) Leak sensors help prevent unexpected slips",
      "A small water leak can create a slick floor long before it's visible. Leak sensors alert you to changes in humidity or water buildup near appliances and pipes.",
      "What to look for:\u00a0Choose ones that send alerts to your phone. You'll avoid a fall and possibly a pricey repair bill.",
      "7) Doorbell cameras keep you from rushing",
      "One overlooked fall trigger is rushing to answer the door. A\u00a0doorbell camera lets you see who's there and speak to them, so you can take your time or decide not to answer at all.",
      "What to look for: A model with two-way audio gives you the freedom to communicate from wherever you are in your home.",
      "While we're on the topic of security cameras, be sure to check out\u00a010 things you must consider when choosing any security camera.",
      "Doorbell cameras enable users to communicate with visitors without rushing to answer the door. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "8) Fall-detection devices can call for help",
      "Even the most independent older adults face higher fall risks, and family members who live far away may worry more than they let on. If a fall happens and you're alone, getting help quickly is essential. Wearables like the\u00a0Apple Watch can detect a hard fall and automatically alert emergency services or your emergency contacts.\u00a0Apple Watch SE, Series 4 or later, and Apple Watch Ultra include fall detection. If a hard fall is detected, the watch vibrates, sounds an alarm, and gives the option to call emergency services.",
      "To turn it on manually:",
      "Open the\u00a0Watch app on your iPhoneTap\u00a0My Watch in the bottom leftScroll down and click\u00a0Emergency SOSToggle on\u00a0Fall Detection and choose\u00a0Always On",

      "Scroll down and click\u00a0Emergency SOS",
      "Toggle on\u00a0Fall Detection and choose\u00a0Always On",
      "If you don't use an\u00a0Apple Watch, there are other great options. Many Android-compatible smartwatches now offer fall detection, including select Samsung Galaxy Watch models.",
      "There are also dedicated medical alert wearables that can help bridge that distance with a single button press. These tools are simple, discreet, and offer life-saving support, especially when no one else is around.",
      "Check out some of the top-rated personal safety tools to consider by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com/MonitorLovedOnes.",
      "What to check: Whether you use a\u00a0smartwatch or a medical alert device, make sure fall detection is turned on, your contacts are updated, and you test the feature once in a while for peace of mind.",
      "Many smartwatches and medical alert devices can detect when a user falls and offer the option to call for help. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "9) Smart speakers make it easier to call for help",
      "Voice assistants like\u00a0Alexa or\u00a0Google Nest can help you call someone, turn on a light, or get a reminder, without having to move.",
      "What to look for: Set up voice shortcuts and routines for common tasks. If you're unsteady, saying \"Call my daughter\" is a lot safer than walking to your phone.",
      "STUDY REVEALS 10 HAPPIEST STATES FOR SENIORS: DID YOURS MAKE THE LIST?",
      "10) Balance-training apps keep your brain and body in sync",
      "Apps like Nymbl for iPhone or Android, or KOKU for iPhone and Android, offer fun daily balance and cognitive exercises that take just a few minutes. The goal? Keep your body strong and your reflexes sharp.",
      "What to check: Use an app that tracks progress and gives feedback. Some are backed by health researchers or physical therapists.",
      "Using apps to perform balance exercises and cognitive challenges can help keep reflexes honed. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Falls aren't only about tripping on a rug or losing your footing. They often involve deeper issues like poor sleep, medication interactions, or delayed reflexes. By using smart tech, you can spot early warning signs, make smarter choices, and stay in control of your health, on your own terms.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Getting older doesn't mean giving up your independence. In fact, the right technology can help extend it. Whether it's a\u00a0smartwatch that alerts family during a fall or a simple nightlight that turns on automatically, every tool you use can add peace of mind. You don't have to wait for a fall to start protecting yourself.",

      "Tech bro Mark Zuckerberg's company has been caught in one of the most disturbing scandals yet.

      "Threads app logo on a smartphone screen with the Meta logo above it. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Meta AI policy allowed chatbots to flirt with kids",
      "According to internal \"GenAI: Content Risk Standards,\" Meta's legal, policy, and engineering teams signed off on chatbot rules that made it acceptable for bots to describe a child as \"a youthful form of art\" or engage in romantic roleplay with minors. Even worse, the guidelines gave room for chatbots to demean people by race and spread false medical claims. This was not a bug. These were approved rules until Meta faced questions. Once Reuters started asking, the company quickly scrubbed the offensive sections and claimed it had been a mistake.",
      "META ADDS TEEN SAFETY FEATURES TO INSTAGRAM, FACEBOOK",
      "We reached out to Meta, and a spokesperson provided this statement to CyberGuy:",
      "\"We have clear policies on what kind of responses AI characters can offer, and those policies prohibit content that sexualizes children and sexualized role play between adults and minors. Separate from the policies, there are hundreds of examples, notes, and annotations that reflect teams grappling with different hypothetical scenarios. The examples and notes in question were and are erroneous and inconsistent with our policies, and have been removed.\"",
      "Meta told CyberGuy that their AI policies prohibit content that sexualizes children.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Big Tech puts profit over kids' safety",
      "Let's call this what it is. Meta didn't stop this on its own. It only acted when exposed. That shows Big Tech's priorities: money, engagement, and keeping kids glued to screens. Safety? Not even on the radar until someone blows the whistle. Meta has repeatedly shown it couldn't care less about your children's well-being. It's about maximizing time online, pulling in younger users, and monetizing every click. This latest scandal proves once again that parents cannot rely on tech companies to protect kids.",
      "Congress pushes Meta to explain disturbing AI rules",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., and a bipartisan group in Congress are demanding that Meta come clean. Lawmakers want to know how and why these policies ever got approval. Hawley called on Meta to release all internal documents and explain why chatbots were allowed to simulate flirting with children. Meta insists it has\u00a0\"fixed\" the problem, but critics argue these corrections only came after they were exposed. Until real regulations arrive, parents are on their own.",

      "While Congress investigates, families need to take immediate steps to protect their children from the dangers exposed in Meta's AI scandal.",
      "Children should never have free access to AI chatbots, including Meta AI. The internal documents show these systems can cross boundaries that no parent would approve of. Supervision is the first line of defense.",
      "Enable parental controls on phones, tablets, and computers. These tools give you more visibility and limit access to risky apps where inappropriate chatbot conversations could happen.",
      "The Meta revelations prove AI can go places parents would never expect. Ongoing conversations with your children about what is safe and what is not online are essential for their protection.",

      "While antivirus software won't stop AI flirting, it adds a much-needed layer of security. Hackers and bad actors often target kids through the same devices where chatbots live, so whole-family protection matters. The best way to safeguard from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing you and your family's private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "More people are turning to artificial intelligence for support, even for mental health advice. It's easy to see why: tools like ChatGPT are free, fast, and always available. But mental health is a delicate issue, and AI isn't equipped to handle the complexities of real emotional distress.",
      "To address growing concerns, OpenAI has introduced new safety measures for ChatGPT. These updates will limit how the chatbot responds to mental health-related queries. The goal is to prevent users from becoming overly dependent and to encourage them to seek proper care. OpenAI also hopes to reduce the risk of harmful or misleading responses through these changes.",

In another, it allegedly encouraged terrorism.",
      "CHATGPT COULD BE SILENTLY REWIRING YOUR BRAIN AS EXPERTS URGE CAUTION FOR LONG-TERM USE",

      "Screenshot of a prompt asking if ChatGPT can provide mental health advice (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What new safeguards has OpenAI set in place?",
      "From now on, ChatGPT will prompt users to take breaks during long conversations. It will also avoid offering specific advice on deeply personal issues. Instead, the chatbot will help users reflect by asking questions and offering pros and cons, without pretending to be a therapist.",
      "OpenAI stated,\u00a0\"While rare, we're continuing to improve our models and are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately and point people to evidence-based resources when needed.\"",

      "\"This signals hackers like ShinyHunters evolving from brute-force hacks to AI-amplified social engineering, targeting third-party platforms where humans are the weak link.

      "\"Attackers today are digital con artists with an unprecedented toolkit,\" Amper explains.\u00a0\"With AI, they can convincingly impersonate real people using cloned voices, speech patterns and even realistic video deepfakes. With just 10-20 seconds of someone's voice, they can create an audio clone that sounds exactly like them. Armed with this, attackers call customer service reps, posing as an executive, a partner or a high-value customer, and request sensitive account changes or data access.\"",

      "Customer service portals hold a wealth of personal information and often have the power to reset accounts or override security settings. This combination makes them especially attractive to hackers.",
      "\"Customer service platforms are considered a treasure trove because they store detailed personal data, transaction histories, and sometimes have capabilities to reset passwords or override security settings,\" Amper notes. \"Unlike core financial systems, many lack robust security controls, making them accessible to attackers armed with partial user information.\"",

The group has recently been linked to a string of high-profile incidents involving companies such as AT&T, Ticketmaster, Allianz Life and Pandora. In this case, the attackers targeted Google's corporate Salesforce system, which the company uses to store contact information and notes about small and medium-sized businesses.",

      "Why cigarette butts make a good asphalt additive",
      "Modern road construction often relies on additives to improve the strength and flexibility of asphalt. Some road-building materials already use cellulose fibers like those found in cigarette filters. That sparked the idea to take used butts, clean them up and put them to work.",

      "How cigarette butts are recycled into road material",
      "The recycling process involves several steps:",
      "1. Collecting and sorting: Filters from traditional and e-cigarettes go through a collection and cleaning process. Ash and residue are removed, leaving behind usable fiber material.",
      "2. Shredding and mixing: Machines shred the cleaned fibers and combine them with synthetic hydrocarbon wax, which serves as a binder.",
      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",
      "Up to 40% of the final road material can come from these recycled components.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",
      "Illustration of a traditional roadway surface (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",
      "This technique is still emerging, but interest is growing worldwide. In Bratislava, Slovakia, city officials have already started collecting cigarette butts specifically for road construction. One road built with this recycled asphalt is already in use, setting an example for other cities to follow.",
      "As more pilot projects roll out and awareness spreads, cigarette butts could shift from toxic litter to a valuable resource in sustainable infrastructure.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Recycling cigarette butts into asphalt solves two problems at once. It clears toxic waste from public spaces and makes roads that last longer. This approach turns one of the world\u2019s most common pollutants into a valuable construction material. As more cities explore cleaner, smarter infrastructure, this kind of solution could play a big role in the future of street design.",

The record shows they suborned perjury, including soliciting others to make false claims that their father violently raped Lyle\u2019s girlfriend and that their mother poisoned the family. The Board correctly determined that Erik Menendez\u2019s actions speak louder than words, and that his conduct in prison and current mentality demonstrates that he still poses an unreasonable risk of danger to the community.

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",
      "ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LEADERS SEEK TO EASE RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN CONCERNS AFTER US-BROKERED PEACE DEAL",
      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

Theft and looting have not been an issue for the GHF, which continues to provide between one and two million meals per day through distribution sites secured by armed guards. GHF has provided over 130 million meals since the start of its operations on May 27.",
      "\"The presence of armed security is one of the reasons why GHF has been able to deliver aid successfully without a single truck being looted,\" noting that \"in one of the most volatile and complex operating environments in the world, that security is the only reason food consistently reaches civilians without interference from Hamas.\"",
      "Though a group of about 230 NGOs initially rejected the organization on account of what they called \"militarized distribution sites,\" Chapin Fay, Gaza Humanitarian Foundation spokesperson, said things might be changing as over 200 international organizations, \"sent a letter calling on the U.N. to collaborate with us.\"",
      "\"This is not the militarization of aid\u2026 It is the only way to make sure food actually reaches civilians. Every decision we make is guided by protecting lives.\"",

We have consistently called for civilians to always be protected and for us to be enabled to reach people in need.",
      "\"In order to reach people in Gaza facing starvation, we need a predictable lifeline of aid via all available crossings and through all available corridors.

ICE detention or deportation to an unknown third country still threaten to tear his family apart,\" his attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"A measure of justice has been done, but the government must stop pursuing actions that would once again separate this family.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has become a central talking point in the Trump administration's deportation efforts after a monthslong back-and-forth legal saga.",
      "His lawyers have said that Abrego Garcia, born in El Salvador, illegally immigrated to the U.S. when he was 16 to join his brother in Maryland out of fear of gang violence in his home country.",
      "He was first deported to CECOT \u2014 the notorious mega-prison in El Salvador \u2014 in March, in what the government called an \"administrative error.\"",
      "The deportation directly conflicted with a judge's 2019 ruling that Abrego Garcia not be deported and came after he was detained by local police and accused of being a member of MS-13, an international crime gang. He was not turned over to ICE in that case, and his family and friends have repeatedly denied his involvement in the group.",
      "Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in June and immediately federally charged with conspiracy to unlawfully transport illegal aliens for financial gain and unlawful transportation of illegal aliens for financial gain in Nashville.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to both charges. A criminal jury trial in Tennessee over the human trafficking charges remains set for January."

    "summary": "The family of the late famous Mexican artist is struggling to reach a legal agreement with the corporation that has long controlled products sold in the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Many Frida Kahlo fans who want to honor the artist, drawn by her unbreakable spirit and her unique way to portray her pain on the canvas, visit exhibitions of her work or purchase posters and other items featuring her art. But in doing so, they may not be respecting her legacy or wishes, her relatives say.",
      "A legal dispute over how her trademarks can be used is before a Florida appeals court this summer and could set precedents that affect other artists.",
      "On one side of the dispute, which has been going on for years, are relatives of the famous Mexican artist; on the other is the U.S.-based Frida Kahlo Corporation (KFC), which has long owned the trademark rights for certain Kahlo-themed products sold in the United States.",
      "In the middle is the public, said William Scott Goldman, a lawyer specializing in branding, \"the people interested in seeing an exhibition or owning pieces that reference an artist who has been beloved by generations.\"",
      "These legal disputes create confusion and can pose a challenge to consumers, Goldman said, as people may have purchased a product thinking it represented the artist's vision accurately but are then faced with doubts about whether that's the case.",
      "The origin of the disagreement",
      "The dispute has been dragging on since 2018. That year, Kahlo\u2019s grandniece, Mara Cristina Teresa Romeo Pinedo \u2014 who was granted power of attorney over the late artist's property rights in 2003 \u2014 complained that FKC had granted Mattel the rights to make a Frida-inspired Barbie.",
      "Romeo Pinedo argued that Kahlo would not have wanted to be represented with a doll that conceals her iconic unibrow. Mattel argued that it did obtain permission to produce the doll through the FKC and that it worked with them legally during development.",
      "In the end, as a result of the lawsuit, the \u201cFrida Barbie\u201d was not sold in Mexico, although it was sold in other countries. Romeo Pinedo then attempted to terminate the 2005 contract that had initially allowed FKC to market some of its products in the United States, such as T-shirts, cellphone cases and tequila.",
      "But the corporation, which insists it has the rights to market merchandise related to the artist in the U.S., has continued to come up with more products and events, including an immersive exhibition featuring photographs of the artist and some of her creations, which was to include a gift shop featuring Kahlo-inspired items.",
      "Romeo Pinedo attempted to stop the exhibition \u2014 which was scheduled to be held in cities like Miami \u2014 by submitting in 2022 a letter of withdrawal in which she said the uses of Kahlo\u2019s image should be determined by her family.",
      "Frida Kahlo Corp. sued, alleging that the family is interfering with its business activities, according to legal documents seen by Noticias Telemundo.",
      "\u201cAs the plaintiffs are the ones who obtained the copyright licenses to use Frida Kahlo\u2019s images in the exhibit, this company asserts that the defendants do not have the right to publicity of Kahlo\u2019s name or image in the U.S.,\u201d the corporation states in one of the related documents.",
      "The Florida appeals court must now determine whether the case brought by FKC can proceed, taking into account that Romeo Pinedo is a Mexican citizen and therefore not necessarily subject to U.S. jurisdiction.",
      "Who are the \u2018legitimate owners\u2019?",
      "\u201cAt the heart of the dispute is who the true or legitimate owners of the Frida Kahlo trademark are worldwide,\u201d Joanna Andrade Lehmann, a senior attorney at EPGD Law representing Romeo Pinedo in the case, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "\u201cThe family maintains that if you\u2019re going to commercialize Frida Kahlo\u2019s image, it has to be in line with what she stood for and the values \u200b\u200bshe defended,\u201d he said.",
      "\"In my opinion, this will mark a turning point not only for our client, but for other artists or descendants of artists who are in similar situations,\u201d the attorney said.",
      "She said that if the Florida court decides it can act on jurisdiction, and possibly rule against Romeo Pinedo, then it will be \u201ca precautionary measure for others\u201d outside the U.S. that their trademark could be subject to the preferences of an American company.",
      "\u201cThey have to take this as a precautionary measure and be more careful when doing business in the United States because, well, they may be submitting to U.S. jurisdiction without knowing it,\u201d said Andrade Lehmann.",
      "Noticias Telemundo attempted to contact the law firms representing Frida Kahlo Corp. but received no response. However, in a May hearing, the company\u2019s legal team argued that the Florida appeals court should be able to rule on the situation because the withdrawal letter sent in 2022 was received on U.S. soil.",
      "For Goldman, the attorney who's an expert in branding, the situation is interesting because it raises a question: Today, when so many products from or related to artists are commercialized  and many companies sell items that are not necessarily authorized by those artists or their families, what should be done?",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like the debate about art versus commerce or the market, about the tensions that can exist between the advertising and intellectual property interests of corporations versus what certain individuals desire,\u201d Goldman said.",
      "\u201cAnd if related trademarks are being challenged, it becomes even more complicated,\u201d he added.",
      "Because the normal purpose of a trademark is \u201cto serve as a mark of quality and ensure that it is not diluted,\u201d said Goldman, if there are disputes over which mark should be used, counterfeit products may proliferate.",
      "For now, the issue of who owns the rights to Kahlo\u2019s legacy remains, pending a decision by the appeals court on whether FKC\u2019s lawsuit can proceed, even though Kahlo's grandniece is not in the U.S. as a subject of its laws.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s hope there\u2019s no jurisdiction, but if there is, it\u2019s something that will have to be taken into account\u201d for other international artists who want to market products or their image in the United States, Andrade Lehmann, the attorney representing Romeo Pinedo, said.",
      "\u201cIt would become possible for a court in the United States to decide who owns the trademark,\u201d she said. And \u201cnot all artists or artists\u2019 heirs can afford to bear the costs of the local legal system\u201d enough to fight the situation like Romeo Pinedo, she pointed out.",
      "There is no deadline for a ruling, which the attorney said could result in the entire case being dismissed or in additional hearings being requested to discuss other possible outcomes.",
      "An earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo."

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has signed an order authorizing roughly 2,000 of the National Guard troops deployed to Washington, D.C., to carry weapons, two U.S. officials told NBC News.",
      "In recent weeks, hundreds of National Guard members fanned out across the nation\u2019s capital as part of what the White House has framed as an urgent crackdown on crime and lawlessness. The troops in Washington have been unarmed. They have mostly been sent out to assist local law enforcement officers in parts of Washington known for tourism, such as the National Mall.",
      "The two U.S. officials said Hegseth\u2019s authorization will be approved by the U.S. Marshals Service, an agency of the Justice Department. Guard members who are supporting law enforcement functions will likely carry weapons, whereas troops who are assigned to beautification tasks across the district likely won\u2019t be armed, the officials told NBC News.",
      "The type of weapons they would carry has yet to be determined.",
      "\u201cAt the direction of the Secretary of Defense, JTF-DC members supporting the mission to lower the crime rate in our Nation\u2019s capital will soon be on mission with their service-issued weapons, consistent with their mission and training,\u201d a U.S. defense official said, using the acronym for Washington\u2019s joint task force.",
      "The deployment of National Guard members to Washington has drawn intense criticism from Democratic leaders, who say the move is a clear case of executive overreach. The National Guard is traditionally focused on domestic crises such as national disasters and civil unrest.",
      "Mayor Muriel Bowser has pointed to Washington police data showing that violent crime has decreased 26% compared with last year. The Justice Department launched an investigation into whether the district\u2019s police department manipulated crime data to make crime rates seem lower.",
      "Bowser\u2019s spokesman declined to comment on Hegseth\u2019s order.",
      "Trump greeted dozens of law enforcement personnel and National Guard troops in Washington on Thursday, thanking them for what he described as a strong start to his administration\u2019s anti-crime and beautification measures.",
      "\u201cI feel very safe now, and I\u2019m hearing people are very safe,\u201d Trump told the crowd while flanked by senior administration officials, later adding: \u201cYou people are winners, and I just think it\u2019s such an honor to be with you. We\u2019re going to make Washington, D.C., great again.\u201d",
      "Trump implied the troops would remain in Washington for at least six months.",
      "\u201cYou do the job on safety, and I\u2019ll get this place fixed up physically, and we\u2019re going to be so proud of it at the end of six months,\u201d the president said.",
      "Hegseth, for his part, visited roughly 300 mobilized Guard members at the D.C. Armory on Thursday.",
      "Seventy-six people were arrested in Washington on Thursday night, a White House official said, bringing the total number of arrests since Trump\u2019s law enforcement initiative started to over 700.",
      "Thirty-six of the people arrested overnight were undocumented immigrants, the official said.",
      "Earlier this year, the Trump administration sent National Guard troops to Los Angeles to respond to protests around immigration raids.",
      "The White House is simultaneously attempting to exert more control over Washington\u2019s Metropolitan Police Department, one of the largest municipal police forces in the country. The president has long blasted what he presents as out-of-control crime in cities governed by Democratic mayors.",
      "Hegseth\u2019s order authorizing federal troops to carry weapons had been expected. Two officials previously told NBC News that some troops would begin to bear firearms."

      "Markets rose Friday after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell appeared to open the door to lowering interest rates, something analysts say would help boost overall activity in the U.S. economy but at the risk of spurring inflation.",
      "The S&P 500, one of the broadest index of stocks, climbed 1.5%, while the tech-focused Nasdaq increased 1.9%. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average also jumped about 1.9%, closing at a fresh all-time high.",
      "The gains ended a multiday losing streak that had begun to spark fears of a more sustained pullback by investors amid ongoing economic uncertainties. Investors also cheered an announcement  by Canada earlier in the day that it would drop many retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "In a closely watched speech Friday, Powell said the Fed\u2019s benchmark lending rate, which has been unchanged since December, was \u201crestrictive,\u201d meaning it may be holding back consumption and investment. He suggested the Fed was now open to lowering it, something that would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. The Fed's next interest rate meeting comes Sept. 16.",
      "\u201cSofter borrowing costs bolster trader confidence and widen the path for a broader rally going forward,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Torres, senior economist at Interactive Brokers financial group, said of the speech and its effect on the stock market.",
      "The Fed has thus far been hesitant to make that change out of concerns about lingering inflation.",
      "The central bank is tasked by Congress with keeping inflation and unemployment low, a mandate that requires it to be careful not to overly accelerate or slow down the economy with its interest rates. Powell said Friday that while the economy was now facing the prospect of both higher inflation, in part from President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs, and weakening employment, there had been a \u201cshifting balance of risks\u201d toward labor market deterioration. Officials said this month\u2019s unexpectedly weak jobs report \u2014 one that caused Trump to fire the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics \u2014 may have helped solidify the case for the first rate cut of Trump\u2019s second term.",
      "\u201cHe used the speech to solidify expectations for 25 basis points in September,\u201d James Bullard, former president of the St. Louis Fed, said in an interview Friday on Bloomberg Television, meaning that he expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point. The rate currently stands at about 4.25%. \u201cHe leaned into the most recent labor market report, which was very soft. And so I think that\u2019s a done deal.\u201d",
      "The large upward move in stocks Friday suggested Powell\u2019s openness to a rate cut took investors by surprise. In the run-up to the speech, commentators said they expected Powell to take a more cautious approach about the central bank\u2019s next rate move, citing his prior remarks and more recent ones by Fed officials seen as close allies that stressed the ongoing risk of worsening inflation, especially from Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "\u201cChair Powell\u2019s Jackson Hole speech leaned more dovish than we expected,\u201d analysts with Deutsche Bank said in a note Friday, referring to an investor phrase for a central bank\u2019s willingness to lower rates. \u201cAs the speech made clear, downside risks to the labor market have risen in Powell\u2019s view following the last jobs report, which showed substantially cooler job gains following surprisingly large downward revisions.\u201d",
      "Powell\u2019s speech \u201cwas reigniting animal spirits in markets,\u201d Interactive Brokers\u2019 Torres said.  While there is no guarantee that cheaper borrowing will immediately lead to more jobs, stocks tend to benefit in such a scenario.",
      "\u201cSofter borrowing costs bolster trader confidence and widen the path for a broader rally going forward,\u201d he said."

      "The lawsuit argued that the detention facility in the Everglades\u2019 construction skirted environmental laws. The suit said that the center was built without ecological reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act and without public notice or comment and that the government failed to comply with other state and federal statutes, including the Endangered Species Act.",

      "Samples, however, noted that while this decision is significant, \"it is not a final win.\"",
      "\"We already know there will be an appeal, so I\u2019m going to stop there,\" she said.",

      "During a separate news conference on Friday morning, Gov. Ron DeSantis admitted that the judge's decision to halt operations at \"Alligator Alcatraz\" was not unexpected.",
      "\"This is a judge that was not going to give us a fair shake,\" DeSantis said about Williams. \"This was preordained, very much an activist judge that is trying to do policy from the bench. This is not going to deter us. We\u2019re going to continue working on the deportations, advancing that mission. We knew that this would be something that would likely happen, and we will respond accordingly.\"",
      "DeSantis said his administration is working on opening more facilities like the one in the Everglades.",
      "\"So, I did announce that we are going to be opening another facility right outside of Jacksonville, in Baker County, and we\u2019ve called that the 'Deportation Depot.'\"",

      "\u201cToday is not about one person, it is about our mission: The midterms are ahead, where we must expand our majority in the House and Senate and continue electing Republicans nationwide,\u201d Gruters told RNC members after his election Friday. \u201cAnd then we march forward toward the presidential election, where the stakes could not be higher.\u201d",
      "Gruters takes over the RNC ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Republicans will be tasked with protecting their narrow majorities in the House and Senate.",
      "The RNC currently has a considerable cash advantage over the Democratic National Committee. Through July, the RNC had $84 million on hand, compared to just $14 million for the DNC, according to new campaign finance reports filed this week.",
      "With Gruters, the White House has an RNC chairman that has long been in lockstep with its political goals and someone they deeply trust.",
      "\u201cWe wish Chairman Wheatley much success and know the Republican National Committee will be stewarded well by Sen. Joe Gruters,\u201d Trump chief of staff Susie Wiles told NBC News on Friday. \u201cJoe has been a part of the Trump team since the very beginning and we appreciate his willingness to serve in this important leadership role as the GOP continues to grow and elect good Republicans to serve the country.\u201d"

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance denied that the administration's investigation of John Bolton was retribution for his criticism of Trump.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance on Friday confirmed that President Donald Trump's administration is \"in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation\" into former national security adviser John Bolton, but he denied that the investigation was retribution for Bolton's criticism of Trump.",
      "Vance's comments came after the FBI executed a search warrant on Bolton's Maryland home on Friday morning.",
      "\"We\u2019re in the very early stages of an ongoing investigation into John Bolton. I will say we\u2019re going to let that investigation proceed,\" Vance told NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" moderator Kristen Welker in an exclusive interview.",
      "\"We are investigating Amb. Bolton, but if they ultimately bring a case, it will be because they determine that he has broken the law,\" he added. \"We\u2019re going to be careful about that. We\u2019re going to be deliberate about that, because we don\u2019t think that we should throw people \u2014 even if they disagree with us politically, maybe especially if they disagree with us politically \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t throw people willy-nilly in prison. You should let the law drive these determinations, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\"",
      "Vance declined to comment on the specifics of the investigation and on whether Bolton would face federal charges, but he confirmed earlier reporting that the case centers around the storage of classified documents.",
      "\"I\u2019ll let the FBI speak to that. Classified documents are certainly part of it, but I think that there\u2019s a broad concern about, about Ambassador Bolton. They\u2019re going to look into it,\" Vance told Welker.",
      "\"And like I said, if there\u2019s no crime here, we\u2019re not going to prosecute it. If there is a crime here, of course, Amb. Bolton will get his day in court. That\u2019s how it should be. But again, our focus here is on, did he break the law? Did he commit crimes against the American people? If so, then he deserves to be prosecuted,\" Vance added.",
      "The vice president doubted that Bolton had been detained as part of the investigation but wasn't able to confirm that, telling Welker, \"I haven\u2019t talked to the FBI this morning. I don\u2019t know the answer to that question. I assume that he hasn\u2019t been detained and won\u2019t be detained until there\u2019s an actual prosecution, if that actually happens.\"",
      "The search of Bolton's home began around 7 a.m. on Friday and the investigation is examining the storage of classified documents and potential instances of documents being used in leaks to news media, a source familiar with the matter told NBC News.",
      "Bolton served as a national security advisor to Trump for about a year and a half during his first term. The two parted ways contentiously in 2019, with Trump claiming he fired Bolton and Bolton claiming he offered to resign after a disagreement.",
      "Since then, Bolton has been an outspoken critic of Trump, alleging in a 2020 book that Trump often made foreign policy decisions in his first term based on whether they would boost his chances of re-election.",
      "In the first several months of Trump's second term, Bolton has also routinely emerged as a skeptic of the president's foreign policy and as a critic of several members of Trump's cabinet.",
      "When pressed by Welker about whether this is retribution, Vance repeatedly denied that Bolton's criticism was driving the investigation, saying, \"I suspect that if the media and the American people let this case actually unfold, if they let the investigation unfold, as it\u2019s currently doing, they\u2019re going to find out that what we\u2019re doing is being very deliberate and being very driven by the national interest, and by the law here and that\u2019s as it should be.\""

    "story": [
      "Jerome Powell appeared Friday to open the door to the central bank\u2019s first rate cut of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term as the Federal Reserve chair indicated that current monetary policy may be restricting economic activity.",
      "In a closely watched speech at the Fed\u2019s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powell said the labor market was now in a \u201ccurious kind of balance\u201d resulting from lowering hiring and decreasing availability of workers amid Trump\u2019s immigration crackdown and demographic changes.",
      "But overall, \u201cdownside risks to employment are rising,\u201d Powell said. \u201cAnd if those risks materialize, they can do so quickly in the form of sharply higher layoffs and rising unemployment.\u201d",
      "As a result, a change in the Fed\u2019s current policy stance \u2014 in the form of lowering its benchmark interest rate \u2014 may be warranted, he said. By making it less expensive for consumers and businesses to take out loans, the Fed seeks to boost overall economic activity.",
      "Stocks surged on the remarks as investors anticipated the Fed was now more likely to lower its key borrowing rate at its next meeting in September.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s speech could not be more clear that Powell is ready to cut rates on September 17th and the market is now fully priced for it and for a 2nd one by year end,\u201d Peter Boockvar, an independent economist and market strategist wrote in a note following Powell\u2019s speech.",
      "Trump has spent months lobbying for a rate cut, arguing they had yet to spark significant inflation. Powell addressed that, too, on Friday, saying the impact of tariffs on consumer prices \u201care now clearly visible\u201d and that they expect continued effects \u201cover coming months.\u201d But he said there remained \u201chigh uncertainty about timing and amounts.\u201d",
      "The speech comes as the central bank faces both internal divisions about the future direction of monetary policy while it responds to a shifting economic landscape and unprecedented outside pressure as key Fed officials face attacks from the Trump administration.",
      "Some Fed members believe that any inflation caused by President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs will prove short-lived and that rates should be lowered to counteract signs of a deteriorating labor market, according to minutes from the most recent Fed meeting. Reducing the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers tends to spur economic activity and thus hiring.",
      "Other Fed members said that it was too soon to know how long the price increases from the tariffs will persist and that despite some signs of weakening, the jobs market is in no imminent danger. These officials would prefer to keep interest rates closer to current levels.",
      "Economic analysts say conflicting economic data have set the stage for the differing views. While layoffs and the unemployment rate remain relatively low, hiring rates have also stalled. Meanwhile, recent inflation reports show mixed effects on prices for goods affected by tariffs \u2014 but that price growth for many consumer services remains elevated.",
      "\u201cCore inflation is still stubborn and the labor market, while showing some signs of cooling, isn\u2019t screaming for emergency intervention,\u201d Kevin Ford, strategist at Convera financial group, wrote in a note to clients. \u201cThis disconnect is what makes Powell\u2019s speech a high-stakes event.\u201d",
      "Trump continues to hammer Powell on social media, calling on him to lower rates to boost the economy and, in particular, to boost home buying. But since the Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate does not affect mortgage rates, many experts believe the home market will continue to drift sideways no matter what the Fed does. It would likely take a significant economic downturn to materially lower the 30-year mortgage rate, experts say.",
      "This week, Trump administration officials opened up a new front against Fed personnel, accusing Lisa Cook, who holds a governor position at the central bank, of committing mortgage fraud. The charge is being led by Bill Pulte, head of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, who posted images that suggested Cook claimed two different homes as her primary residence, but did not provide further evidence. Trump subsequently called on her to resign. Pulte continued his attack Friday, posting another image that he said suggested discrepancies in Cook\u2019s mortgage documents, though these could not be verified. Trump subsequently posted again that Cook must resign or he would fire her.",
      "Cook, who was nominated by President Joe Biden, said in a statement that she would take any questions about her financial history \u201cseriously as a member of the Federal Reserve\u201d and was \u201cgathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d",
      "Trump is already set to increase his influence on the Fed directly after he nominated his economic adviser, Stephen Miran, to replace Fed governor Adriana Kugler, who recently announced her resignation."

      "\u201cYouth and young adults are more likely to identify as transgender due to a variety of factors, including a greater willingness among younger individuals to disclose that they identify as transgender on surveys,\u201d Herman said in a news release.",

      "The study also noted that the race and ethnicity distribution of transgender individuals \u201cappears similar to that of the U.S. population.\u201d",
      "At the state level, Minnesota was estimated to have the highest percentage of transgender adults, making up 1.2% of the population of people ages 18 or older, while Hawaii is reported to have the highest percentage of transgender youths, comprising 3.6% of the population in the 13 to 17 age group.",
      "Researchers used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-administered public health surveys called the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System and Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, the study said."

    "published": "Fri, 22 Aug 2025 18:06:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Shawn Hatosy previews Season 2 of \"The Pitt,\" shares why the show is resonating so much and how he's preparing to direct Episode 9.",
    "story": [
      "Shawn Hatosy is getting ready to clock back in for a shift at \"The Pitt.\"",
      "The medical drama, which premiered in January 2025, is on a fast track rarely seen in streaming shows these days. Filming for Season 2 is well underway, and a teaser for the sophomore outing dropped Aug. 21. But eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Hatosy's character, the internet's favorite night shift attending, Dr. Jack Abbot, wasn't seen in any of the clips.",
      "Shabana Azeez, who stars in the show as medical student Victoria Javadi, joked on her Instagram that Abbot is in a \"retirement home.\" Hatosy has another explanation.",
      "\"I have not shown up yet,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"I'm still about to, so getting prepared for that. I know the cast and crew have been diligently kicking away for a couple months now. So I'm getting ready.\"",
      "The 15-episode procedural \"The Pitt\" has received acclaim for its unconventional format \u2014 each episode reflects one hour of an emergency room shift, with the whole season comprising just one day in the life. Season 1 opens with senior emergency attending Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Noah Wyle, arriving for his shift, relieving a distraught Abbot. In the first episode, Robinavitch finds Abbot on the roof, who asks why they continue to show up at the grueling job each day.",
      "By the end of the season, Abbot makes a triumphant return to the emergency department in the wake of a mass casualty shooting. He ends the day answering his own question\u00a0\u2014 \"We\u2019re the bees that protect the hive,\" he says \u2014 effectively solidifying his character's arc and making Abbot a \"fully formed character,\" Hatosy says.",
      "\"I feel like I have his backstory down to this point,\" Hatosy says. \"I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that.\"",
      "Below, Hatosy previews what could be in store for Abbot in Season 2, unpacks his character's buzzy chemistry with Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) and reflects on being nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest actor in a drama series.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I don't actually know the answer to the first question.",
      "I love the show. I love the character. I think that the night shift has a lot of elements that people respond to. I think it takes a certain type of individual to decide to work nights, and Abbot would be the leader of that because his therapist says he finds comfort in the darkness. I would love to check in once the original \"Pitt\" is up and running, because that's the first priority. But if the writers have the bandwidth for it, I mean, I would love it.",
      "I think No. 1, the medicine. We don't dumb it down in any way. We treat it as it is. So I think the audience, even though they may not understand it \u2014\u00a0I certainly don't understand some of the things that are happening \u2014 there's a trust there. You expect them to follow it, and they do.",
      "I also think the immersive feeling of the narrative being one day, I think it adds to the excitement and the adrenaline. And then the characters are all so well drawn. Each has their own distinct point of view, and people respond to that. I also think that they're all inherently decent people working there, and in a world that's very divided right now, they have pledged to take care of everybody and do their job and save lives.",
      "They do. I'm the target of that sometimes.",
      "Oh yeah, of course. There's always a healthy dose of nerves and fear when you're both directing and acting. The first time you present a character on a TV show, it's terrifying because you're like, \"Whatever I do now I have to commit to for however many years this goes.\" So there's just a lot of anxiety. With directing, you're responsible for so many departments and ideas, and it's definitely scary, but that is what keeps you working so hard. It's a good scary. It's the kind that you need to sort of give you that lift.",
      "But like you said, listen, I'm a performer. So there's a language that actors have with each other. So my first point of attention is always going to be towards the performance, because that's where I come from. So even though they may call me old and a grandpa and chronically online, or whatever they say, I will power through it.",
      "I've said it before, there was a scene early on where he talks about how she's one of the smartest people here. I think that he's not just saying that, I think he believes that. He just respects her. I think he sees her as the future of the ER. There's some light flirting happening, and it's definitely layered into the script. Some writers may say, \"No, we were just putting stuff there.\" But it seems obvious to me. I think that the scene with the pigtail catheter, where he's ... sort of insisting that she do it, even though there's only one case in history of this exact procedure that's ever been done \u2014 it just shows how much he respects her. And sometimes that can turn into something more, you know, when you're working together.",
      "We haven't. I'm actually curious to see how she feels. She might be like, \"Ew, gross,\" and it's possible.",
      "I did read something that Noah said online yesterday in an interview where he was talking about Abbot in Season 2. I don't know much, but I did hear him say that they're going to delve deeper into Abbot's backstory and his relationship with his deceased wife. He still wears his wedding ring. That's one of the pieces of hidden trauma that I knew about, but we haven't gone into yet, but I think we might deal with it this season.",
      "It's still a mystery to me. I've received scripts, though. I'm just about now ready to sit down and plunge in. For directing, I'm going to have to catch up.",
      "They're kind of mirror images of each other, but one is night, one is day. (Laughs). I think the writers did a really nice job of the way that they presented the bookends of the roof scenes. Abbot, seemingly coming off of a horrendous night shift, losing this vet who he spent three hours trying to save, I think that affected him and made him question his purpose. And by the end of the shift, he's up on the roof and the roles are reversed now. Robby has had his worst day, and Abbot is metaphorically talking him off the ledge.",
      "But Abbot's purpose is crystallized in that moment. He figures out that the reason that he keeps coming back is because they're the bees that protect the hive. It's in his DNA \u2014 I think that that line is pure Abbot. It's the spine of how I shape that character.",
      "I think he is in many ways, at least at the end of Season 1, a kind of a fully formed character, whereas Robby has experienced a type of PTSD that will need attention. Abbot has proven and said that he's working on himself, and it'll be nice to find out if Robby will go that path.",
      "I don't know about that. There's so much about just the way he carries himself that's very much me. I was trying to avoid creating something that was transformative. I wanted him to be as close to me as possible. Sometimes that can be challenging, playing somebody that's very close to you, somebody that's like you. So there's that.",
      "I think it's amazing that he's had a rough night, and he's sitting there in his whatever, I don't know, house, van, I don't know, listening to a police scanner, just waiting for an emergency. I think that does say a lot about him. And I do think Season 2 will highlight a little bit more of what he does in his off time, and we will learn maybe why he does stuff like that.",
      "No, I think as actors, we often create these little things to give energy or life to a scene. ... That's kind of the training that you get as an actor. So it's just even the Mohan stuff, whether or not it was explicit, the nuance for me was always this sort of feeling of flutter that he gets with her. Because he does respect her, and she responds.",
      "You're always trying to build a backstory. And what's incredible about episodic television is sometimes even the writers create a backstory, and they tell you that, and then you get to, like, Season 3, and it completely changes, and you just have to accept that. That's how the stuff that I build in there\u00a0\u2014 it's never right, but you just kind of have it in there to bring nuance to the scene.",
      "I feel like I have his backstory down to this point. (Laughs.) I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that. I've worked on John Wells-produced shows, this is my fifth show with him, and every single one of them, I've played pretty complex characters. Like for \"Southland,\" each season, Sammy Bryant would get to a place where I'm like, \"I don't know if he can recover from that.\" And then John will, and his staff of brilliant writers, always come up with a plan that knocks him down another peg. And I'm assuming that Abbot will have a very roller coaster, emotional plight.",
      "I'm feeling great. I'm so ... I'm overwhelmed. It means so much to get the support from the people in the business that do this. But more importantly, I think it's just exciting for the show, being recognized. I'm proud of the show. I think it has something important to say about health care workers, and it is a show that doesn't cost a lot of money compared to other shows, and it's shot in L.A. I think it's great for the business, this show, this model. And I hope that this success, the critical response, leads to more shows like it.",
      "And how I celebrated, (laughs), I was alone in a hotel room in Vancouver, actually. And my wife and I were on the phone, and then I received a lot of phone calls congratulating me. I think I've heard from everybody. And I don't drink anymore, and it's been a while since I've done that, but I actually was like, \"What am I going to do?\" So I went to Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and I played pickleball with complete strangers. So that's how I celebrated.",
      "No. (Laughs.) The nomination really is the win. It feels great. And it's been a grinding career, just grinding it out. So the nomination is great. Whatever happens from there? Thank you. And if not, OK. It's not going to change anything about how I work, or what this show looks like. We're gonna attack it from the same point of view.",
      "No, just go easy on me out there on the internet. I'm very sensitive."

      "In the footage, 21-year-old Aaden looks amused as his mom playfully adorns his face with a variety of digital stickers, including a mustache and a cowboy hat. As Gosselin, 50, scrambles to keep up with comments, he happily guides her through it. Their interaction offers a glimpse of a fresh and unseen side of their relationship.",
      "Gosselin shares 8 children with her ex-husband Jon Gosselin: 24-year-old twins Maddie and Cara, and sextuplets Aaden, Alexis, Hannah, Collin, Leah and Joel.

      "If anyone would know, it\u2019s Ariana Madix, who co-hosted the reunion alongside Andy Cohen. As both are no strangers to the reality TV reunion experience \u2014 Cohen, the father of reunion specials on Bravo, and Madix, a former Bravo star \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see why they were the perfect people to help the Islanders unpack the season.",
      "Ahead of the \u201cLove Island USA\u201d Season 7 reunion, airing Aug. 25 at 9 p.m. ET on Peacock, Madix spoke with TODAY.com to give a peek at what viewers can expect.",
      "It\u2019s a little bit of a full circle moment, because, obviously, all the things that you just mentioned, but I feel like it was really fun because we have known each other for 10 years. And we had a really great chemistry. I feel like as the day went on, that became more and more apparent that we kind of just decided to take the bull by its horns. So as the day went on, we just really leaned into that.",
      "I think that\u2019s when we really hit our groove. And I mean, if we ever want to team up on anything ever again, I\u2019m down! Because we had a great time doing it.",
      "Everything was definitely very even. I think Andy made it clear \u2014 he was like, \"This is your show, this is not me coming in and taking over.\" And I was like, \"That\u2019s so nice of you,\" because obviously I look up to him and his interview skills for a lot of reasons.",
      "But I think there were a lot of things \u2014 when they first came to me with the idea of doing a reunion this season \u2014 that I said needed to be different. I said no one is allowed to sit behind me. \u2026 I was like, I really want to be able to send in some of my notes so that maybe at some point I can incorporate some of my own questions, which I was able to do here and there. And I think we were all in agreement that we wanted there to be less people out the entire time. So there was a structure, which I think really helped, because that was something (about) last year: I really wish that we were able to talk to them in smaller groups about specific things. And I think that that was something that \u2026 really helps to be able to have these deeper conversations that we wanted to have with them.",
      "I think they left in good spirits. There were a lot of things that I think a lot of them wanted to be able to express to each other \u2014 whether that was something that worked toward a resolution either way. Whether, like, we\u2019ll be friends now, or OK, maybe it\u2019s better off as not. I think that was important for them to be able to sit there, have that conversation and be able to move forward from there, and they all seem in great spirits.",
      "They\u2019re all so good at expressing how they feel about difficult topics. And that is something that I admire about them so much, because when I was that age, I don\u2019t think I had that. I even still struggle to have that ability. And I really look up to them in that way. I mean, I think there was a moment where Olandria and Chelley were expressing how they felt about something, and I just was in such awe of their ability to speak about their feelings so beautifully and clearly, and I struggle with that, so I always just find that very admirable.",
      "Well, in the past with \u201cVanderpump,\u201d I had seasons where I watched everything, and then there were times where I didn\u2019t. So I see both sides of watching or not watching. I think ultimately you have to do what\u2019s right for yourself. I do think that sometimes there\u2019s something that we\u2019re referencing that would be nice if everybody knew what we were talking about \u2014 but I also understand getting to a point where you\u2019re like, \"I just lived this whole thing. Do I need to relive it?\" So I definitely see both sides of that.",
      "Oh, my gosh. Well, I think they\u2019re all so different, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so cool. Even seeing some of the things that they\u2019ve been doing since then, they all have their own niche. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about them. I think that they each bring something unique to the table, so I\u2019m excited to see what they do from here.",
      "I mean, I was asking Olandria if she was going to go back to elevator sales, but I think that she has a very big career in things that are definitely not elevator related. But I think it\u2019s really cool for them to be able to have this platform and realize their dreams with it. I think sometimes people online, they have a weird thing about whether they have a following or whatever. But I just think, you know, go for your dreams, and if this is the path that leads you there, then do it.",
      "It was so great for them to come to the sandwich shop! You know, that\u2019s kind of our vision for the shop when we first had the dream of opening it: Have your girls there for a little kiki, a little girls lunch. I love seeing them \u2014 watching them succeed, it just makes me so happy. And I love those girls so much, and I love seeing them just out in this world, taking it by storm. They are stars, but I feel like we knew that at the beginning. I just remember watching all of them walk into the villa that first night and knew right away they were it \u2014 they had it.",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s a moment in \u2018Weirdo\u2019 where so much is going wrong in my life that it feels like I\u2019m losing all of the color in the world around me,\" he explains. \"So visually, we demonstrate that motif by literally having the colors drain from the pages until the comic is black and white.\u201d",
      "Weaver also uses his extensive knowledge of manga and anime within the world of \u201cWeirdo.\u201d From \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to \"Ace Attorney\" and \"JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure,\" there are at least 50 references in the novel \u2014 with the first three pages having 12 alone. He calls the references the novel\u2019s \u201cstrongest advantage\u201d as it helps create a fantastical mirror of readers' own world.",
      "\u201cI want kids of a variety of fandoms to look at what we\u2019re making and say, \u2018Oh, I belong here. This guy gets it. These people understand me. I can be safe here,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "But it\u2019s not just kids who feel seen while reading Weaver\u2019s work. Though \u201cWeirdo\u201d is marketed as a middle grade novel, it has managed to strike a chord with adults as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to speak to a lot of adult readers of \u2018Weirdo\u2019 and normally the story goes something like this: \u2018I got it for my son, I got it for my nephew, I got it for my niece, and I sat down and read it before I gave it to them, because I wanted to vet it. And, man, I wish I had this book when I was younger.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the highest praise that a person can receive,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think that motivates me a lot as I create. What I say is that \u2018Weirdo\u2019 is for every person on their journey to self-love. Some of us take that journey when we\u2019re kids. Others of us end up very far into adulthood before we\u2019re able to take those steps. But it\u2019s my goal that it\u2019ll be there as a support for everybody,\" he adds.",
      "In addition to being an author, Weaver is the founder and CEO of Weird Enough Productions, a media company dedicated to using anime to create positive representations of Black men and other minority groups. Through Weird Enough Productions, Weaver and his team, along with collaborators like anime distributor Crunchyroll, aim to boost reading proficiency among marginalized readers by helping them connect with characters in manga and comics.",
      "According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 33% of 8th graders are not reading at the NAEP Basic level, meaning \"a third of 8th graders likely could not identify basic literary elements in a text.\"",
      "Literacy experts say that graphic novels can help promote reading comprehension among younger readers, as the combination of pictures and text can keep them engaged with the material. According to a survey conducted by School Library Journal in May 2023, out of the respondents, 90% of public librarians and 83% of school librarians say they suggested graphic novels to students who struggle with reading.",
      "But there is the persisting belief that graphic novels don\u2019t count as \"real reading,\" and 59% of the school librarians surveyed said they've received opposition to graphic novels from teachers, parents and more.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if I can read a classic piece of literature, that I\u2019m smart. Whereas, if I read 1,000 chapters of \u2018One Piece\u2019 and I understand the themes and what\u2019s being communicated, that that\u2019s low brow, and that\u2019s not as important,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThe data is very clear about what graphic novels do to positively benefit literacy and get kids reading, and I think it\u2019s a no-brainer why graphic novels are a great way to get kids excited about literacy and about storytelling,\" he adds.",
      "This back to school season, Weaver is raising money to purchase books for underresourced schools across the country. Weaver is hosting the fundraising campaign, titled Nerds for Literacy, on the Weird Enough website. After raising funds, Weaver will purchase a list of books \u2014 selected by donors, literacy education specialists and young readers \u2014 from independent bookstores and distribute them to schools.",
      "\"WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT. EVERY NERD IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE YOUTH LITERACY CRISIS?!\" states the donation page, which so far, has raised $25,000 in 48 hours.",
      "In addition to producing his own graphic novel and running Weird Enough Productions, Weaver also uses social media to discuss hard topics in the nerd community, such as racism, bullying and mental health. However, he takes a unique approach.",
      "\u201cWhen I started creating content online, one of my largest gripes was that it felt like everybody was reading off of a cue card. The information wasn\u2019t being presented in an engaging way, in a particularly intuitive way, or in an easy to understand way,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it was super long winded. This video took 60 seconds, you could\u2019ve explained this to me in 10.\u201d",
      "With that, he decided to challenge himself. And what did he decide to do? Well, rhyme.",
      "He calls himself, \"Dr. Seuss without the racism,\" as the children's author's legacy faced a reckoning in 2021 over the racist imagery in his books. In March of that year, Dr. Seuss Enterprises stopped publishing and licensing six of his children's books and said in a statement they \"portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.\"",
      "Weaver says he can\u2019t stop rhyming \u2014 no matter how hard he tries.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was supposed to be, I have such mastery over the information that I\u2019m trying to present to you that I can do it in a whimsical and rhyme scheme type way, and you still understand exactly what\u2019s going on. That was my goal,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it reached a point where I actually can\u2019t stop rhyming,\" he adds. \"I write stuff and my brain immediately is like, \u2018Cool, so we\u2019ll rhyme it like this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, no one said this had to rhyme. What are you doing?\u201d",
      "And yes, he did try pausing this approach as an experiment. Let\u2019s just say, people were not supportive.",
      "\u201cWe stopped rhyming for a couple of videos, and the people were like, \u2018Where are the rhymes?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe people have spoken. They want the bars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeirdo's\" sequel is currently in the process of being illustrated and will be released in early 2027, he says. The sequel will follow Weaver and his friends (and some new faces!) and connect to the events that occur at the end of the first book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intended to grapple with some of these negative feelings that kids have around standardized tests and around the ways that institutions measure intelligence inaccurately,\" he says.",
      "While most of the experiences in \u201cWeirdo\u201d were lifted right from Weaver\u2019s life, he\u2019s having a bit more \"fun\" with its sequel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit more of a divergence between what real life Tony experienced and what\u2019s going on in the world of \u2018Weirdo,\u2019 which lets us play around a lot,\" he says.",
      "Weaver is also trying to find new ways to add more \"updated\" references, but he's admittedly finding it a bit tricky.",
      "\u201cIf you reference it in the last book, are you allowed to reference it this time?\" he poses. \"If you do reference it, do you reference it differently? How do you do it?... Are we talking about Fortnite in \u2018Weirdo 2\u2019? Are there Battle Buses? Are they dropping on Tomato Town? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "While we wait for the sequel, Weaver is keeping his cards close to his chest about what is happening between now and then.",
      "\u201c\u2018Weirdo 2\u2019 is going to be exciting, but you got to keep your eyes peeled. Sequels are always cool things to continue projects, but there are other ways that projects can continue to live on, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cAdaptations are a thing, and that\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cHostage.\u201d",
      "The \u201cHostage\u201d crisis has ended, and so has UK Prime Minister Abigail Dalton\u2019s (Suranne Jones) no-good, terrible, very very bad week.",
      "The Netflix limited series, which stars the \u201cGentleman Jack\u201d actor alongside Oscar nominee Julie Delpy (the \u201cBefore\u201d movie trilogy) as French President Vivienne Toussaint, has been a thrill ride of twists, turns and upending conventions.",
      "The limited series was a breathless roller coaster of a ride for PM Dalton and her family. First her husband Alex (Ashley Thomas), a worker with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders), and his team were taken captive in French Guiana \u2014 just as President Toussaint was in London for a summit to discuss much-needed medicines being sent to the British people.",
      "Vivienne was a challenge to get on board with helping the hostages \u2014 especially after she was blackmailed over her fling with stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest). But once Abigail and Vivienne became a team and the hostage crisis ended, it was hard to know what the series would do with the rest of its episodes.",
      "Not to worry: There was still a bombing, political intrigue, Abigail\u2019s being removed from office, a secret investigation with loyalties tested, the demise of Vivienne in a heroic move, and yet another hostage-taking.",
      "So how did it all wrap up? Not quite in a happy, neat bow \u2014 there were casualties of more than one kind in the fifth and final episode. Let\u2019s see who lived, who died, and who will bear the scars.",
      "Do Abigail, Alex and their daughter Sylvie survive on \u2018Hostage\u2019?",
      "Good news: Yes. Bad news: not without some damage.",
      "The episode begins in the immediate aftermath of the 10 Downing Street explosion. The culprit? Saskia\u2019s (Sophie Robertson) conveniently \u201cleft behind\u201d laptop, brought helpfully to the building by Matheo. Angry ex-military man John Shagan (Martin McCann) detonates the laptop.",
      "What does Saskia have to do with this? Turns out Saskia \u2014 posing as Matheo's girlfriend \u2014 was formerly a corporal in the Highland Guards. Her battalion was shut down by Abigail Dalton in an initiative to fund health-related initiatives. John is a retired Highland Guard captain who decided to plan a coup against the prime minister and recruited the likes of Saskia to carry it out (more on that later).",
      "In the blast, Vivienne perishes while alerting the room to the peril.",
      "Alex races in to help his wife, pulling her from the rubble. The Daltons (along with teen daughter Sylvie, played by Isobel Akuwudike) embrace and phew, that might seem to be the end of it. Dalton has been voted out of office by her ministers in a no-confidence vote, and now perhaps she\u2019ll be able to rest easy and leave politics behind.",
      "Er, no. There\u2019s still much of the episode to go! So with John and Saskia on the loose, Dalton sends her family to a safe house Matheo recommends, and all three (plus security) head out to the countryside and a beautiful mansion to rest and recover.",
      "Who dies at the safe house?",
      "Almost immediately, Saskia and John figure out where they believe the Daltons have holed up. Saskia pins down Matheo and Sylvie with a gun, while John scuffles with Alex, slashing his stomach with a knife. John forces the disabled Alex to call Abigail and get her to the house \u2014 without backup.",
      "Abigail arrives downstairs as Matheo, upstairs, dials the equivalent of a 999 call in secret. When Saskia finds out what he\u2019s doing, they struggle and she loses her weapon. He lets her escape (well, they were once lovers) while Sylvie picks up Saskia\u2019s discarded gun.",
      "The teenager goes to find her parents, hearing them in a heated moment with John. Trembling, she turns the gun on John. But her parents urge her not to fire \u2014 they seem to be well aware that if she kills John, she\u2019ll have to live with it for the rest of her life. John, clearly knowing this is his endgame, lets Sylvie know he\u2019s responsible for her beloved grandfather\u2019s murder and \u2014 blam. John goes down. Sylvie, it seems, is a very good shot.",
      "Who\u2019s behind John\u2019s plot, and why was he so focused on Abigail?",
      "We\u2019ve been getting bits of information about John throughout the series. Early on, he tells Alex that he once had a daughter himself.",
      "As we learn, an invasion years ago by Guatemala into Belize (a former Crown colony, now independent) led to Abigail (then a governmental minister) to make a heartbreaking choice between getting British citizens and troops out of the country, or saving locals.",
      "(The invasion is fictional, but the story echoes recent American policy during the Afghanistan evacuation.)",
      "But John had been in love with one of those locals left behind \u2014 and she was pregnant when the invaders shot her.",
      "He wasn\u2019t alone in being furious with Abigail, though.",
      "In yet another betrayal, John is linked to General Livingston (Mark Lewis Jones), who\u2019s got his own bone to pick with the PM over her military spending cuts. He never wanted her dead, just \u201cout of the way,\u201d but John had his own plans.",
      "Abigail and her team figure out that Livingston and John served together, and after some ranting and raving in the war room he\u2019s set up, the general is arrested and marched out.",
      "Does Abigail retire from politics in the end?",
      "In the final scenes, the Daltons are gathered at 10 Downing Street as Abigail prepares for a press briefing outside. Sylvie looks chastened, cuddling a cat. They all agree with Abigail\u2019s plan, whatever it is \u2014 and she pauses on her way out to gaze at a portrait of the late Vivienne.",
      "Outside, we learn that Abigail is now back in power. Her speech underscores that she plans to be truthful and honest with the press and the public going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least you deserve,\u201d she says."

    "story": [
      "A viral internet song \"I Have One Daughter\" originated from a Tinder conversation.",
      "The audio, which has over 120,000 uses on TikTok, follows a dialogue between two dating app users.",
      "\u201cYou have any kids?\u201d one Tinder user asks the other in the song.",
      "\u201cYes, I have one daughter. How about you?\u201d the other responds.",
      "\u201cHow many baby daddies do you have? If you don\u2019t mind me asking,\u201d the first speaker returns, seemingly not realizing that one child can only have one biological father.",
      "The miscommunication evolves throughout the pop song. Inspired by the track, creators are putting their own spin on the tune to depict strange dialogues.",
      "For example, a paleontology volunteer posted a parody video of conversations she has with people who don\u2019t think fossils are proof dinosaurs exist. Another creator shared a video reenacting questions she is commonly asked as a female engineer. Internet personality Trisha Paytas even stepped in with her version of the trend to explain why she doesn\u2019t plan to have more kids.",
      "Other creators have posted skits based on questions they are frequently asked to spread awareness on gaps in public information or missed social queues.",
      "While the song has inspired thousands of users on the app, it was created by one person: Creator Luke Holloway (@lewky____).",
      "Meet Luke Holloway: The musical mind behind \u2018I Have One Daughter\u2019",
      "TikTok creator Luke Holloway (@lewky____) created the song as part of an online series where he turns \"terrible\" Tinder conversations into music.",
      "Holloway tells TODAY.com that he has over a decade of experience producing music and wanted to create a presence for himself on social media. The inspiration for his Tinder videos came from Gabriel Kahane, a composer who used to turn Craigslist posts into songs.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d been trying on and off for years to put some funny stuff out on the internet,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to actually stick to it, but last year, I thought \u2018Okay, I\u2019m actually going to do it.\u2019\u201d",
      "The videos, such as his songs \"Say Potato!\" and \"Do You Do Cocaine?\" started to take off online. Many of his songs have gained millions of views, but his most popular track so far is \u201cI Have One Daughter.\" The original video, which is number 25 in his series of Tinder parodies, has over 31 million views on Instagram and over 17 million views on TikTok.",
      "Holloway says he based the tune off a Tinder conversation sent to him by one of his followers. While some of his past videos have views in the millions, he did not expect that \"I Have One Daughter\" would go so viral.",
      "\u201cIt was just one of them on my list,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cI just really didn\u2019t think it would blow up the way it did.\u201d",
      "The musician adds that watching other users relate the song to their own personal experiences has been rewarding.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been fun to see people take it and use it for their own personal issues, their own things, where they feel like they say something to somebody, but the other person is not understanding them,\" Holloway says. \u201cThat seems to be sort of the universal usage of it.\u201d",
      "When it comes to his production process, Holloway says he aims to create a new Tinder song once a week.",
      "He says the creation of \u201cI Have One Daughter\u201d started with a beat that felt \"right for the conversation.\" From there, he found a chord progression he liked and came up with the song's first line, then began \"riffing\" and eventually landed on the song's melody. In the video, Holloway sings the lyrics and dresses up in costume.",
      "For the song, which he says only took around two hours to write, Holloway took some inspiration from Adele\u2019s \u201cSend My Love (To Your New Lover).\u201d",
      "Holloway adds his songs are influenced by his theatrical background and that the \"bones\" of his internet songs are musical theater.",
      "One day, Holloway says he would like to turn all his Tinder conversations into a live musical.",
      "\u201cTheater is dialogue,\u201d Holloway says. \u201cThe songs are supposed to be, generally speaking, literal dialogue set to music. So that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m doing in my songs.\u201d"

      "\"We had lots of different names, and then everything was taken. And then she's like, 'What do you think about Stockton Street?' And I was like, 'That's it!'\"",
      "After settling on a name, Serena Williams said she and her sister were psyched to dive into the podcast itself.",
      "\"We also just love to think about branding in different ways and different sorts and just feeling like Stockton Street is something that \u2014 it's still there. It will always be there. We can kind of just live on, and we can talk about lots of different things on our podcast,\" she said."

      "Angela Bassett knows firsthand how brokenhearted \u201c9-1-1\u201d fans still are over Season 8\u2019s major plot twist.",
      "\u201cMy sister\u2019s one of the fans, and she won\u2019t stop talking about it,\u201d Bassett tells TODAY.com.",
      "Bassett has starred as Los Angeles Police Department Sgt. Athena Grant since Season 1 of the first responder procedural. The show opens with Athena\u2019s first marriage headed for divorce, but by the end of Season 1, she finds love with Fire Department Chief Bobby Nash, played by Peter Krause. The two marry in the Season 2 finale.",
      "That relationship, known to fans as \u201cBathena,\u201d became one of the emotional centers of the high-stakes show, and together, they survived a tsunami, a sinking cruise ship and a plane crash. But in Season 8, Episode 15, Bobby died after he was exposed to a deadly virus in a lab accident. The plot twist marked the first major character death throughout the show\u2019s eight season run and sparked an outpouring of emotions from fans, from grief to anger.",
      "\u201cShe is mad,\u201d Bassett says now of her sister, about four months after the episode aired. (Season 8 ended May 15. Season 9, which was officially renewed in April, is currently in production.)",
      "She says her sister, like many fans, still asks her: \u201cIt don\u2019t make sense \u2026 Is he coming back?\u201d",
      "Bassett\u2019s answer? \u201cI have to keep his memory alive in some way,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m making no promises. I\u2019m wondering just like you, just like the fans.\u201d",
      "In the aftermath of Bobby\u2019s death, some fans theorized it wasn\u2019t the end of the road for Krause\u2019s character. Season 8, Episode 15, ended with a body bag being removed from the lab with Bobby\u2019s helmet abandoned on the ground. In the next episode, Krause returns for flashback scenes and as a figment of Athena\u2019s imagination as she struggles to cope with the loss and make funeral arrangements for her husband.",
      "In the end, she decides to bury her husband back in Minnesota, beside his first wife and two children, who died in a fire before the events of Season 1.",
      "But many fans cling to the fact that technically, audiences didn\u2019t see Bobby\u2019s body \u2014 though \u201c9-1-1\u201d showrunner Tim Minear has said in multiple interviews that Bobby is really dead.",
      "Plans for Season 9 remain a mystery, but we know actors Corinne Massiah and Elijah M. Cooper, who play Athena\u2019s two children, May and Harry, will serve as series regulars for Season 9, putting a spotlight on Athena\u2019s family life in the wake of her husband\u2019s death.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s interesting how sometimes, a lot of times it seems, storylines in the show will mirror in a way what\u2019s going on in real life,\u201d says Bassett, who shares twins Bronwyn Golden and Slater Josiah with husband Courtney B. Vance. \u201cYoung boys, just thinking they know it all and they\u2019re grown and making their own decisions, which is not quite what mom had in mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey still need mom, but they don\u2019t think they do,\u201d she adds.",
      "So while Harry has \"growing pains, becoming a man,\" she describes Massiah\u2019s character, May, as being stuck in the middle.",
      "\u201cEither she\u2019s on my side or his side. She is his sister, so, help me out girl,\u201d Bassett jokes.",
      "Bassett also confirms, \u201cOf course they\u2019ve got to put me in some sort of life-threatening dangerous situation.\u201d After all, fans may recall Season 8 opened with a \u201cbee-nado,\u201d or bee tornado, that caused a midair crash and left Athena to land a plane on the L.A. highway.",
      "Reflecting on that dramatic Season 8 plot point, the Oscar nominee lightheartedly jokes, \u201cYou don\u2019t know how I shake and grab onto seat mates in a plane when I feel a little bit of turbulence... OK, so now I\u2019m landing a plane?\u201d",
      "As for how she finds out about the shocking circumstances ahead for her character, Bassett says she usually gets wind of what\u2019s coming not from scripts, but from the crew behind-the-scenes.",
      "\u201cMaybe I have to go in for a fitting, so maybe I\u2019ll hear, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re going to be doing something crazy,\u2019 because a lot times the heads of the department will get, if not the script, the idea of what it\u2019s going to be about before we do so they can get a little head start. And then sometimes they can\u2019t help but share,\u201d Bassett says.",
      "\u201cAnd then the script comes,\u201d she continues, \u201cand I\u2019ve always made it out to be crazier in my head, just hearing about it, then when I read it, it\u2019s like, \u2018OK, this is doable. I guess.\u2019\u201d"

      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "\"We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters Wednesday.",
      "He added: \"We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.\"",

      "\"We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it \u2014 with additional central aid distribution points,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition \u2014 and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.",
      "The assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel\u2019s military offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, the prime minister's office said that \"ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables \u2014 for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas \u2014 be shortened.\"",
      "\"The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,\" the statement added. \"Together we will win.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the Israeli military's announcement and said in a statement that the Israeli government \"insists on continuing its brutal war against innocent civilians, escalating its criminal operations in Gaza City with the aim of destroying it, and displacing its residents in a full-fledged war crime.\"",
      "The United Nations also denounced the military operations Wednesday. \"Israel\u2019s reported decision to take full control of Gaza City and to forcibly displace its population will lead to mass killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure vital to the survival of the population,\" the U.N. human rights office for the Palestinian territories said in a statement.",
      "President Donald Trump supports Israel's efforts to disarm Hamas, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "\"Israel has to make this decision and has to live with whatever decision they make. But President Trump is fully supportive of making sure that Hamas knows that from the U.S. perspective, they have to disarm, they have to give up and let all the hostages go,\" he said. \"Whether it takes 60 days or 60 minutes, that\u2019s the ultimate end result.\"",
      "Scores of people in Gaza have starved to death in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.",
      "In addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated Israel's streets, with growing numbers demanding an end to the offensive in the enclave.",
      "Hundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.",
      "Israel also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Huckabee said that recent announcements by European leaders recognizing a Palestinian state would be \"counterproductive.\"",
      "\"If they believe that, unilaterally, calling for a two-state a Palestinian state recognition immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it\u2019s taking them further away,\" he said.",
      "Ceasefire talks uncertain",
      "Katz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was  olding a discussion Tuesday to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.",
      "The announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off news that Hamas had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free the remaining hostages.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in Israel\u2019s court,\u201d Abdelatty said, adding: \u201cWe would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.\u201d",
      "Asked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be \u201cunder immense pressure.\u201d",
      "Asked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said \u201cno\u201d and did not provide further clarification.",
      "'There is no safe place'",
      "New satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel\u2019s advance, with the country\u2019s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave\u2019s south condemned by rights groups.",
      "Imagery captured on Aug. 16 shows that sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on Aug. 9.",
      "Mohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again \u2014 just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,\u201d Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel\u2019s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The family was able to live in their home for the past six months \u2014 but with Israel planning to take over Gaza City, they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza.",
      "\u201cThere is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,\u201d Abu Sharia said. \u201cMy concern is to save the family\u2019s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWith more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,\u201d it said.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed."

      "The robotic participants came in all shapes, sizes and structures and competed in 26 different sports events, from running to kickboxing to soccer. The unusual state-backed sports tournament at the National Speed Skating Oval, a Beijing Olympic venue, came as the United States and China race each other to shape the future of AI.",
      "No speed records were being set, and many of the athletes were prone to fizzling and face plants. Some robots broke down unexpectedly while they were competing, while others didn\u2019t complete their tasks as planned. A viral video showed a running robot veering off course and accidentally knocking over a person on the track.",
      "But for the robots\u2019 developers, the games were less about winning or losing and more about testing their agility, endurance and battery life, all of which have made great advances in recent years.",

      "Ukraine's commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said in a statement Thursday that he had participated in the meeting by videoconferencing with the other military commanders.",
      "\"I am convinced that through joint efforts, with the political and diplomatic support of Ukraine\u2019s dedicated partners, we will be able to achieve a real peace and guarantee security for Ukraine and the whole of democratic Europe,\" he said.",
      "Trump has promised European leaders that the United States would help provide security guarantees in any settlement with Russia, a key concern for Kyiv. He has since made it clear that that would not include U.S. troops on the ground but has said it might involve air support.",
      "Once Kyiv has more clarity about what protections its allies are willing to offer, Zelenskyy said, he would then be ready to meet with Putin. And if Putin was not ready to meet, he said, he \u201cwould like to see a strong reaction from the United States.\"",
      "Where those talks might place has emerged as a possible stumbling block.",
      "The White House has pressed ahead with making arrangements despite some public reluctance from the Kremlin. The Hungarian capital, Budapest, and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites being discussed, a senior administration official told NBC News, as Washington sought to secure a location and date.",
      "But Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Budapest would be a \u201cchallenging\u201d venue for his first direct talks with Putin since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.",

      "Adding to the apparent lack of urgency in talks, Russia launched a massive aerial bombardment overnight that included nearly 600 drones and 40 missiles, Ukraine's air force said early Thursday.",
      "The strikes reached deep inside Ukraine, hitting an American business in the Western region of Zakarpattia, Zelenskyy said, and injuring at least 15 employees. At least one person was killed and two other people were injured in Lviv as dozens of residential buildings were destroyed, governor Maksym Kozytskyy wrote on Telegram.",

      "North Korea has a covert military base near the Chinese border that poses a \u201cpotential nuclear threat\u201d to the U.S. mainland, according to new research.",
      "The Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base is about 17 miles from the border with China in the North Korean province of North Pyongan, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said in a report Wednesday.",
      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
      "\u201cThese missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,\u201d the report said.",
      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Researchers said the report was based on interviews with defectors and officials around the world, as well as declassified documents, satellite images and open-source information.",
      "The report said the weapons at the base could include North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMs or a missile that has yet to be revealed.",
      "\u201cCurrent assessments are that during times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites.\u201d",
      "According to the latest estimate from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea has assembled about 50 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.",
      "Construction of the Sinpung-dong base began around 2004, and it was \u201cgenerally complete and operational\u201d by 2014, the report said. Satellite images suggest the base continues to be developed and \u201cis active and being well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d it said.",
      "It is one of about 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and related facilities across the country that North Korea has never declared, the report said.",
      "Since denuclearization talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in 2019, North Korea has been steadily advancing its weapons programs in defiance of international sanctions.",
      "It has also strengthened security ties with Russia, including sending arms and troops to fight in its war against Ukraine in exchange for support that experts say could include technological assistance with its weapons programs.",
      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "On Monday, Kim called for a rapid nuclear buildup amid annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises that Pyongyang sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Though Trump has expressed an interest in resuming in-person diplomacy with Kim, his regime has dismissed the idea and says the United States must accept North Korea as a nuclear power."

      "There are fears that Afghanistan could be further destabilized by the mass expulsions, which have been criticized by international rights groups, as well as Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban, as a violation of international norms and humanitarian principles.

      "Whether a venue will even need to be chosen is another matter.",
      "While not \u201cimpossible,\u201d a meeting between the two leaders would be \u201ca big surprise,\u201d Keir Giles, a senior fellow at the London-based think tank Chatham House, told NBC News.",
      "Putin has \u201ccarefully avoided\u201d meeting Zelensky until now, he said in a phone interview, \u201cbecause doing so conflicts with his narrative of Ukraine not being a proper country and Zelenskyy not being a legitimate leader.\"",
      "Tatiana Stanovaya, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, a Berlin-based think tank, echoed those doubts. A meeting would be \u201cpointless\u201d for Putin and will not happen \u201cunder the current circumstances,\u201d she wrote on X.",
      "Putin \u201chas repeatedly stated that such a meeting would only be possible if there were well-prepared grounds, which in practice means Zelenskyy\u2019s acceptance of Russia\u2019s terms for ending the war,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Seven European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity. The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",
      "Some met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and other officials that morning. Others made their way to the White House directly from Dulles and other airports. They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The display took place within days of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and ahead of a possible Trump-brokered meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy as Trump casts himself as a potential peace broker.",
      "Inside the Oval Office on Monday, evoking a boardroom scene, Trump sat behind the Resolute desk, military flags at his back, as Zelenskyy and the European delegation faced him, as reflected in a photo shared by the White House. Made of oak timbers taken from a British ship, the desk is a hulking 19th century reminder of goodwill between important allies, a gift from Britain's Queen Victoria to the United States. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Finnish President Alexander Stubb has proved pivotal in the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, taking on new importance after he bonded with President Donald Trump over their mutual love of golf.",
      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",
      "He responded sharply to Russia\u2019s immediate rejection of the idea that those security guarantees would potentially include a NATO presence.",
      "\u201cRussia doesn\u2019t decide on that,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Stubb, whose country joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine the year before, said the leaders agreed Monday that security guarantees for Ukraine were among their top priorities, along with a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting including Zelenskyy, Putin and Trump.",
      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",
      "18 holes and diplomacy",
      "Stubb gained Trump\u2019s ear over a round of golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March, when they competed together in a member-guest tournament at one of Trump\u2019s courses and Trump gifted Stubb a new set of clubs to replace the set Stubb had brought with him.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin. Zelenskyy has also publicly thanked Stubb for helping him build a connection with Trump in the aftermath of Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s infamously heated Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "Stubb also seems to have sensed how to communicate to Trump the extent of Putin\u2019s prospective land grab of Ukraine\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cFor an American audience,\u201d he told NBC News, \u201cthe best way to explain it is that if you take the relative land mass of what Russia wants right now from Ukraine, it would be a little bit like you giving up Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, even Virginia, and then bumping into Maryland.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NEW ADMINISTRATIVE CAPITAL, Egypt \u2014 There was a muted response from Israel after Hamas said it had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire in Gaza and to free the remaining hostages.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by President Donald Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages would be released and the sides would negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.",
      "He added that the proposals would allow for \u201cthe flow of humanitarian and medical aid into Gaza as soon as possible to address the ongoing starvation there.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in Israel\u2019s court. We would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it is only a 60-day truce, it provides a window of opportunity. We must apply maximum pressure on both sides to move forward,\u201d he added.",
      "Hamas said in a statement Monday that the militant group and other Palestinian factions had approved proposals that were put forward by Egyptian and Qatari mediators.",
      "Asked about that announcement, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred to a statement he made Monday suggesting a determinedness to push ahead with a military campaign to assume full control of Gaza City in the north of the enclave. They also noted that Hamas appeared to be \u201cunder immense pressure.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu's office did not respond when asked for a further response about the proposals.",
      "Netanyahu\u2019s ultranationalist finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, condemned the development in a statement Monday. \u201cWe fight only to win! In no way to stop in the middle, with a partial deal that will abandon half of the hostages and could lead to the war being stopped in defeat,\u201d he said.",
      "And Trump also appeared to dampen hopes for a truce in a post on Truth Social on Monday. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!! The sooner this takes place, the better the chances of success will be,\u201d he wrote.",
      "His envoy, Witkoff, pulled out of negotiations less than a month ago, accusing Hamas of not acting in good faith.",
      "The proposals came as Palestinians in Gaza continue to grapple with a devastating hunger crisis, with humanitarian groups warning that the aid entering the enclave in recent days will not be enough to curb a rise in deaths from starvation.",
      "Israel banned the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies into Gaza on March 2, in the midst of its ceasefire with Hamas.  After lifting the blockade in May, it allowed a trickle of aid in for weeks. But amid an international backlash and accusations of using starvation as a weapon of war, it eventually increased the amount allowed in.",
      "Israel has defended the blockade by saying enough aid is entering the Strip, while accusing Hamas of diverting aid, a charge Hamas and aid groups have denied. An internal U.S. government analysis found no evidence of systematic theft of aid supplies by Hamas. The Israeli military dismissed that report as \u201cbiased.\u201d",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said Monday it had recorded three more adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "With entrance by road restricted, some countries have carried out airdrops, although they are widely considered largely ineffective and dangerous. A ship carrying 1,200 tons of food for Gaza was approaching the Israeli port of Ashdod on Tuesday in a bid to help address the crisis, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, while much of the territory has been destroyed."
