      "LOS ANGELES -- After serving nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents, the Menendez brothers will plead their case in front of a panel of California state parole board commissioners starting Thursday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother\u2019s parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at their case over the last three decades:",
      "___",
      "March 1990: Lyle Menendez, then 21, is arrested. A few days later, Erik Menendez, 18, turns himself in. They are charged with first-degree murder.",
      "July 1993: The Menendez brothers go on trial, each with a separate jury. Prosecutors argued that they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys don\u2019t dispute the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "January 1994: Both juries deadlock.",
      "October 1995: The brothers\u2019 retrial begins, this time with a single jury. Much of the defense evidence about alleged sexual abuse is excluded during the second trial.",
      "March 1996: Jurors convict both brothers of first-degree murder.",
      "July 1996: The brothers are sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "February 1998: A California appeals court upholds the brothers\u2019 conviction, and three months later, the state Supreme Court agrees.",
      "October 1998: The brothers file habeas corpus petitions with the California Supreme Court. After they are denied the next year, they file petitions in federal district court, which are also denied.",
      "September 2005: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denies their habeas corpus appeal.",
      "May 3: Attorneys for the Menendez brothers ask the court to reconsider the convictions and life sentences in light of new evidence from a former member of the boy band Menudo, who said he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. In addition, they submit a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin before the killings about his father\u2019s abuse.",

      "\u201cLurker,\u201d a breakout film from the Sundance Film Festival, explores the dark side of celebrity and fandom",
      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",

      "It'll surely carry weight in modern society, but the phrase is referencing events from nearly a century ago. Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",
      "Howard assembles an impressive cast, though it isn't always enough to make up for the overambitious plot of a film that drags in the middle.",
      "1920s Germany, haunted after accepting blame for World War I, was on the brink of demise, as mass poverty and broad social unrest laid ground for the extremism that birthed the Nazi party.",
      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

      "The doctor's philosophical work has spread through letters and newspapers across Europe, attracting settlers like Heinz Wittmer, a veteran of the Great War played by Daniel Br\u00fchl, and his much younger second wife Margaret, played by Sydney Sweeney.",

      "The film lacks depth in exploring questions of morality and human nature while depicting Ritter\u2019s lofty goals to save humanity. His philosophy spirals into madness throughout the film, reduced to brief, sometimes painful and surface level sound bites that eventually devolve into incoherent ramblings.",
      "The movie is at its most compelling when its three female actors are on the screen. Different motivations bring them to the island, each of which ultimately centers on the same blind faith in the idea of the masculine leader. They all end up vastly disappointed.",

Margaret, having married an older man expecting guidance, is instead forced to build her family's future from the ground up, only to fight tooth and nail to preserve it after her husband nearly destroys them. And the Baroness, who confidently declares herself \u201cthe embodiment of perfection,\u201d oozing with seduction, ultimately crumbles at the rejection of a man.",
      "Arguably, Sweeney \u2014 who is almost unrecognizable as the timid and brunette Margaret \u2014 steals the show. She easily delivers the most impactful scene of the movie, as she was forced to give birth to a baby boy alone in the middle of the desolate island.",

      "Caprio's show was filmed in his courtroom and featured his folksy humor and compassion. Clips from the show have had more than 1 billion views on social media.",
      "During his time on the bench, Caprio developed a persona at odds with many TV judges \u2014 more sympathetic and less confrontational and judgmental.",
      "In his bite-sized segments on YouTube, Caprio is often seen empathizing with those in his courtroom. Many of the infractions are also relatively minor, from failing to use a turn signal to a citation for a loud party.",

      "\u201cThe phrase, 'With liberty and justice for all' represents the idea that justice should be accessible to everyone. However it is not,\u201d Caprio said in one video. \u201cAlmost 90% of low-income Americans are forced to battle civil issues like health care, unjust evictions, veterans benefits and, yes, even traffic violations, alone.\u201d",
      "Caprio's upbeat take on the job of a judge drew him millions of views. His most popular videos have been those where he calls children to the bench to help pass judgment on their parents. One shows him listening sympathetically to a woman whose son was killed and then dismissing her tickets and fines of $400.",
      "In another clip, after dismissing a red-light violation for a bartender who was making $3.84 per hour, Caprio urged those watching the video not to duck out on their bills.",
      "\u201cIf anyone's watching I want them to know you better not eat and run because you're going to get caught and the poor people who are working hard all day for three bucks an hour are going to have to pay your bill,\" he said.",
      "His fame reached as far as China, where clips of his show have been uploaded to social media in recent years. Some fans there posted about his death, recalling and praising the humanity he showed in his rulings.",

      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors are urging a federal judge to quickly reject Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u2019 request that he throw out a jury verdict or order a new trial after a jury convicted the music maven of two prostitution-related charges.",
      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",
      "The Mann Act charges each carry a potential penalty of 10 years behind bars. Combs has been denied bail despite his lawyers' arguments that their client should face little to no additional jail time for the convictions. Prosecutors said he must serve multiple years behind bars.",
      "Combs has been in a federal jail in Brooklyn since his September arrest at a Manhattan hotel. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 3.",
      "Prosecutors wrote that Combs' attorneys were mistaken when they contended in a submission to the judge late last month that the Mann Act was unduly vague and violates his due process and First Amendment rights.",
      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said he then used video recordings he made of the sexual events to threaten and coerce the girlfriends to continue participating in the sometimes weekly or monthly sexual meetings.",
      "\u201cAt trial, there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s convictions,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "They said Combs \u201cmasterminded every aspect\u201d of the sexual meetups, paying escorts to travel across the country to participate and directing the sexual activity that took place between the men and his girlfriends \u201cfor his own sexual gratification\u201d while sometimes joining in.",

She said she participated in hundreds of \u201cfreak-offs.\u201d",
      "A woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d said she participated in \u201chotel nights\u201d when she dated Combs from 2021 to last September and that the events sometimes lasted multiple days and required her to have sex with male sex workers, even when she was not well.",
      "Both women testified that Combs had threatened to release videos he made of the encounters as a way of controlling their behavior.",
      "\u201cDuring these relationships, he asserted substantial control over Ventura and Jane\u2019s lives. Specifically, he controlled and threatened Ventura\u2019s career, controlled her appearance, and paid for most of her living expenses, taking away physical items when she did not do what he wanted,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "\u201cThe defendant similarly paid Jane\u2019s $10,000 rent and threatened her that he would stop paying her rent if she did not comply with his demands,\u201d they said.",
      "In their submission requesting acquittal or a new trial, Combs' lawyers argued that none of the elements normally used for Mann Act convictions, including profiting from sex work or coercion, existed.",
      "\u201cIt is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\u201d the lawyers said. \u201cThe men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily. The verdict confirms the women were not vulnerable or exploited or trafficked or sexually assaulted.\u201d",

      "Jon Batiste\u2019s new album is titled \"Big Money.\"",
      "On \u201cBig Money,\u201d Super Bowl-sized singer Jon Batiste opts for a surprisingly intimate sound.",
      "The just over 32-minute, nine-song set will be released Friday, and it\u2019s not nearly as loud as the New Orleans' jazzman's eye-popping wardrobe. The stripped-down, mostly acoustic arrangements create a chill vibe. Simplicity somehow only intensifies the songs\u2019 swing and sway.",
      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",
      "Also stellar is \u201cMaybe,\u201d a ballad filled with thick chords and questions about the big picture. \u201cOr maybe we should all just take a collective pause,\u201d Batiste sings, before launching into a keyboard exploration worthy of Jelly Roll Morton.",
      "The bouncy \u201cLean on My Love\u201d draws from Prince, Sly Stone and the Spinners as Batiste sings in unison with Andra Day. The equally buoyant title cut rhymes \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201cdummy\u201d in a strummy sing-along that includes backing vocals by the Womack Sisters, granddaughters of soul singer Sam Cooke.",
      "\u201cPinnacle\u201d chooses a similar tempo to kick up Delta dust around a delightful word salad. \u201cHop scotch/Double Dutchie jumping rope/Twistin' it and ya wobble it/And let it go,\u201d he sings on one verse.",

      "You can say this: Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin know how to start a movie.",
      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",
      "When an erratic driver careens off the road, they run to check on the passengers. Finding the woman thrown clear of the car, Ashley \u2014 faced with her own mortality \u2014 decides then and there to get a divorce.",
      "In both \u201cThe Climb\u201d and \u201cSplitsville,\u201d these are just the first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts. Their movies \u2014 Covino directs; they write together \u2014 are a little like Wile E. Coyote versions of a rom-com. And part of their considerable appeal is in how much Marvin and Covino are willing to put themselves through the ringer.",
      "Like \u201cThe Climb,\u201d \u201cSplitsville\u201d is a relationship farce that keeps amplifying and recycling. From the scene of the accident, as the credits unspool, Carey trudges seemingly aimless across the countryside. (Splitsville is Nowheresville.) Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",
      "Paul and Carey have a close enough relationship that Paul comes right into the shower to check for ticks on Carey. Later that night, he and Julie casually acknowledge that they have an open marriage. Julie, for instance, could sleep with anyone. Even Carey, they note.",

From there, the four central characters of the film \u2014 Carey, Paul, Julie and Ashley \u2014 will take various turns in less of a romantic triangle than an adult game of musical chairs.",
      "Though there are elaborately choreographed long takes that smack of contemporary moviemaking, \u201cSplitsville\u201d belongs more to a screwball tradition stretching back to the 1930s. This is \u2014 even here in the low ebb of late summer \u2014 an uncommonly adult farce of infidelity that Cary Grant and Irene Dunne might have chuckled at, even if they didn\u2019t get the \u201cVanilla Sky\u201d reference, the digs about New Balance sneakers or the delight of seeing Nicholas Braun turn up, late in the film, as a mentalist.",
      "I\u2019m convinced, though, that the performer here who would have been most at home in that bygone comedy heyday is Johnson. For the second time this year, following \u201cMateralists,\u201d she finds herself caught between the affections of two men. Here, just her watchful poise brings a welcome perspective on the mostly male mayhem around her.",
      "The twists and turns of \u201cSplitsville\u201d can grow a little tiresome. Reversals pile on top of each other. But in a movie about infidelity where everyone is lying more to themselves than to their partners, those patterns effectively lead back to where everyone started.",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Witcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.",
      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d explores the Ohio-born art-rock band known for their quirky style and misunderstood message",
      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

Just tell us about drugs and sex.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rock has always needed bands like Devo, a corrective to the corporate machine. You can see an echo of Devo when M.I.A. raised her middle finger during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2012. The members of Devo cite such bands as Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down as keeping the flame alive.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have done that in the past,\u201d Mothersbaugh tells the AP.",

But there\u2019s also, there\u2019s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it\u2019s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.\u201d",

      "You may think of Devo as New Wave or early electronica or synth-pop. but they see themselves differently: \u201cWe were true punk, meaning we questioned illegitimate authority and we stayed in our own lane and did our thing, remaining true to our vision,\u201d says Casale. \u201cThat\u2019s punk.\u201d",

      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in 2021 is underway",
      "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, was indicted on first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder charges about a year after Young Dolph was killed. Prosecutors have accused him of organizing the fatal shooting.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Govan is charged with conspiring with Justin Johnson and Cornelius Smith Jr. to kill Young Dolph.",
      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",
      "Smith is also charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder and has pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set for him.",

      "In a 2024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \u201cvery senseless murder\u201d and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",

    "story": [
      "Margaret Qualley plays a Bakersfield, California, private investigator in Ethan Coen's \u201cHoney Don't.\u201d",
      "The skies are blue, the sun unrelenting and the body count escalating in the Bakersfield, California, of \u201cHoney Don\u2019t!,\u201d where Margaret Qualley\u2019s private investigator tries to get a handle on the nefarious goings-on in her city with a small-town feel.",
      "It\u2019s the second film in Ethan Coen and Tricia Cooke\u2019s so-called \u201clesbian B-movie trilogy,\u201d and while this shaggy caper might not add up to anything significant \u2014 perhaps part of the \u201cB-movie\u201d point \u2014 it is fun and immensely watchable. That\u2019s thanks in large part to Qualley\u2019s turn as the smoothly confident Honey O\u2019Donahue, kind of a Philip Marlowe, or maybe Veronica Mars, in cherry-red lipstick, high heels and silks (inspired choices for the sweltering setting by costume designer Peggy Schnitzer).",
      "Honey is meant to be strikingly \u201cother\u201d in this very downtrodden Bakersfield of eccentrics, dropouts and lost souls, where missing teeth seem to be more prevalent than pedicures. It\u2019s a carnival of very memorable, very Coen-esque misfits, like a grumpy bartender played by Don Swayze and Charlie Day\u2019s clueless police officer Marty Metakawitch. Marty is not the only man in town who has trouble accepting that Honey will never be interested in him. You could play a drinking game with how many times she has to tell hapless men, \u201cI like girls.\u201d",
      "Not only is queer literacy low in this Bakersfield, but many in town seem to have come under the influence of a church leader played by Chris Evans, the Rev. Drew Devlin, whose high-wattage smile and proclivity for flirting have made him a local celebrity. Evans, who seems to be having fun in a weirder role, plays the Rev. Drew as a charismatic creep, an ego-driven and possibly sex-addicted influencer who is also peddling drugs and arranging hits around town. He too has a boss, or bosses, known only as \u201cthe French,\u201d which is amusingly underexplained. And he\u2019s often completely, or nearly, naked and involved in some cringey, experimental acts with his naive followers.",
      "Not unlike the new \u201cThe Naked Gun,\u201d this saga begins with a suspicious vehicular death. The deceased was an almost-client of Honey\u2019s, which sets her off poking around and looking for answers. Most of her cases are of the cheating spouse type, and this is just more interesting. Meanwhile, others start dropping dead too. Some of these deaths feel spiritually, comedically similar to the Mark Pellegrino sequence in \u201cMullholland Drive\u201d (not the only Lynchian nod). And all signs are pointing back to the church, though Honey gets a bit distracted with a new fling in Aubrey Plaza\u2019s lustful cop MG Falcone and some family drama with her wayward niece Corinne (Talia Ryder).",
      "\u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d might play more like a pilot episode of a television series than a contained film, but it is a step up from Coen and Cooke's previous effort, \u201cDrive Away Dolls,\u201d which felt constructed of comedic parts whose shelf life expired 20 years ago. This script, written by Coen and Cooke, is probably just as vintage, technically speaking, but it feels more timeless. With a stable of memorable side characters, including Josh Pafchek as the reverend's assistant and Jacnier as a skittish new drug dealer named Hector, \u201cHoney Don\u2019t\u201d is gory, unapologetically sexual, quippy and dark. It also clocks in at under 90 minutes \u2014 they knew just when to get out.",

      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",

As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",

      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",

      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "In August 2019, Stewart's right leg was infected while he was kayak fishing in Pensacola Bay. What at first appeared to be a sun blister led to three months in the hospital, where doctors performed 10 surgeries to remove decaying skin and prevent the bacteria from killing him.",
      "\u201cThis ain't nothing to play with,\u201d Stewart said.",
      "Vibrio bacteria thrive in seawater and in the mix of fresh and saltwater found in estuaries and lagoons. Most infections are reported from May to October, and most happen in states along the Gulf Coast.",

      "The antibiotics used to treat food poisoning cases don't work as well when the germ enters through breaks in the skin, Lopez said.",

      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",
      "Africa\u2019s 1.5 billion people accounted for 95% of an estimated 597,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2023, according to the WHO. More than three-quarters of those deaths were among children.",
      "In Uganda, an east African country of 45 million people, there were 12.6 million malaria cases and nearly 16,000 deaths in 2023. Many were children younger than 5 and pregnant women, according to WHO.",
      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",
      "Ugandan authorities, who have been working to update clinical guidelines for treating malaria, say the new drug will be rolled out as soon as possible. It is not yet available in public hospitals.",
      "The development of Coartem Baby has given hope to many, with local health workers and others saying the medicine will save the lives of many infants.",
      "Ronald Serufusa, the top malaria official for the district of Wakiso, which shares a border with the Ugandan capital of Kampala, said he believes Coartem Baby will be available \u201cvery, very soon\u201d and that one priority is sensitizing the people adhering to treatment.",

Andy Beshear took emergency action Monday to ban the sale of \u201cdesigner Xanax,\u201d responding to a request from his state's attorney general who is leading a broader effort to combat the highly potent synthetic drug linked to dozens of overdose deaths last year in the Bluegrass State.",
      "Beshear's action in his state comes as a coalition of 21 attorneys general, led by Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman, is urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to take emergency action banning the unregulated drug. It poses a growing public health threat and is increasingly contributing to overdose deaths, the attorneys general said in a letter dated Monday to DEA Administrator Terry Cole.",

      "In Kentucky, the classification of bromazolam \u2014 widely known as \u201cdesigner Xanax\u201d \u2014 as a Schedule 1 controlled substance took immediate effect following Beshear's emergency regulation. Bromazolam, Coleman has warned, is being passed off as prescription pills including benzodiazepines, which are commonly used to treat conditions such as anxiety disorders, insomnia, and seizures.",
      "He had urged Beshear's administration to ban the drug in Kentucky, and the governor's action on Monday empowers law enforcement to make arrests for selling or possessing the drug, Beshear's office said.",
      "\u201cThis deadly drug has no place in our communities, and now we have the tools needed to get it off the streets and protect more lives,\u201d the Democratic governor said in a release.",

      "In their letter to the head of DEA, the attorneys general said bromazolam is being sold illicitly on the streets and online. It is highly potent and unpredictable, they said, especially when combined with opioids or other central nervous system depressants. Unlike regulated medications, illicitly manufactured bromazolam lacks quality controls, making it particularly lethal for unsuspecting users, they said.",
      "\u201cDespite its clear dangers, bromazolam remains unscheduled at the federal level, creating significant challenges for law enforcement and public health officials trying to respond to this emerging crisis,\u201d the letter said. \u201cWithout scheduling, this drug continues to evade traditional regulatory and prosecutorial tools, hindering interdiction efforts and enabling continued distribution through illicit channels.\u201d",
      "Emergency action by the DEA would help law enforcement remove the drug from circulation, give prosecutors the ability to hold traffickers accountable and would \u201csend a clear signal that this dangerous substance has no place on our streets,\u201d the letter said.",
      "Besides Coleman, the request to the DEA included attorneys general from Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia, Coleman's office said.",

      "NEW YORK -- For the first time in 30 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics is substantially diverging from U.S. government vaccine recommendations.",
      "The group\u2019s new COVID-19 recommendations \u2014 released Tuesday \u2014 come amid a tumultuous year for public health, as vaccine skeptics have come into power in the new Trump administration and government guidance has become increasingly confusing.",

      "\u201cIt is going to be somewhat confusing. But our opinion is we need to make the right choices for children to protect them,\u201d he added.",
      "The AAP is strongly recommending COVID-19 shots for children ages 6 months to 2 years. Shots also are advised for older children if parents want their kids vaccinated, the AAP said.",
      "That differs from guidance established under U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., which doesn't recommend the shots for healthy children of any age but says kids may get the shots in consultation with physicians.",
      "Children ages 6 months to 2 years are at high risk for severe illness from COVID-19, and it was important that recommendations continue to emphasize the need for them to get vaccinated, said Campbell, a University of Maryland infectious diseases expert.",
      "Vaccinations also are recommended for older children who have chronic lung diseases or other conditions that put them at higher risk for severe disease, the AAP said.",
      "The 95-year-old Itasca, Illinois-based organization has issued vaccination recommendations for children since the 1930s. In 1995, it synced its advice with recommendations made by the federal government's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "There have been a few small differences between AAP and CDC recommendations since then. For example, the AAP has advised that children get HPV vaccinations starting at age 9; the CDC says that's OK but has emphasized vaccinations at ages 11 and 12.",

      "The idea that healthy older kids may be able to skip COVID-19 boosters has been brewing for some time among public health experts.

      "Global talks to slash plastic production and the toxic chemicals used to produce plastic products fell apart in Geneva this week",
      "Talks aimed at a global treaty to cut plastic pollution fizzled in Geneva this week, with no agreement to meaningfully reduce the harms to human health and the environment that come with the millions of tons of plastic water bottles, food containers and packaging produced today.",
      "Though as many as 100 countries sought caps on production, powerful oil-producing nations like Saudi Arabia and the United States stood against them. They argued the caps were unnecessary and a threat to their economies and industries.",
      "That means any progress continues to depend on efforts to improve recycling, reuse and product design \u2014 the very things that powerful nations argued were sufficient to address the problem without resorting to production cuts.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about how successful those efforts have been.",
      "The world makes more than 400 million tons of new plastic each year, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates that could increase by about 70% by 2040 without meaningful change. A great deal of that ends up in landfills or, worse, the environment.",
      "Pollution isn't the only problem. Plastics, made almost entirely from fossil fuels, are a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Plastics generated 3.4% \u2014 or 1.8 billion tons \u2014 of planet-warming emissions across the globe in 2019, the United Nations says.",
      "Not very.",
      "It's notoriously difficult to recycle plastics; only 6% of what's made gets recycled, according to the OECD. That's largely because different kinds of plastic cannot be recycled together. They have different chemical compositions, making it costly and time-consuming, and requiring a lot of manual sorting.",
      "\u201cThere are many different colors of plastics, many different types of plastics called polymers, and 16,000 to 17,000 different chemicals used to make plastics, so by design, plastics are not easily recyclable,\" said Judith Enck, president of Beyond Plastics, an organization that works to cut plastic pollution.",
      "Experts say plastic is different from materials like paper, cardboard, metal and glass, which all get reused at much higher rates. The Environmental Protection Agency estimates glass recycling at about 31%, and things like steel cans at about 71%. As much as 64% of paper and 74% of cardboard get recycled, according to the American Forest & Paper Association.",
      "But \u201cIf you just think of your own home or apartment, you might have a bright orange hard plastic detergent container on top of your washing machine, and then you might have a plastic bag,\u201d Enck said. \u201cThose two things cannot get recycled together.\"",
      "The plastics industry says innovations in material science are helping to incorporate more recycled plastics into products and enable more plastic products to be recyclable. Ross Eisenberg, president of America\u2019s Plastic Makers, noted the need for an \u201call-of-the-above approach.\u201d",
      "He said this also includes upgrading recycling infrastructure or improving sorting to capture more used plastics. This also means making recycling more accessible and helping consumers know what can and can\u2019t go in the recycling bin.",
      "But there are a lot of limitations to this.",
      "Depending on consumers for accurate pre-sorting is a lot to ask. And cities may hesitate to make costly infrastructure improvements to their recycling programs if there is little financial incentive or market for the recycled material.",
      "\"Local recycling facilities, or markets for the recycled material, don\u2019t always exist. Where the collection and processing infrastructure does exist, the recycling plants are essentially plastic production facilities, with the same air, water, and soil pollution problems that are harmful to local residents,\" said Holly Kaufman, director of The Plastics & Climate Project and senior fellow at World Resources Institute.",

      "California is currently suing oil and gas giant Exxon Mobil, alleging deception about the possibilities of plastic recycling.",
      "Because of this, Kaufman says, \u201cThe aim should be to significantly reduce plastic production, use, and waste, not recycle more.\u201d",
      "\u201cReuse means creating packaging or products designed to be used multiple times, like refillable containers, or more durable zippered bags that can be washed and refilled many times, extending their lifespan and reducing waste,\u201d Eisenberg, of America's Plastic Makers, said.",
      "Experts say reuse is extremely important, but reusable products shouldn\u2019t necessarily be used for consumables because of the risk of microplastics.",
      "Redesigning plastic often means making it easier to recycle. That can be using one material in packaging instead of several, or printing labels directly onto a container rather than using a separate one that is glued on, but that is more complex.",
      "Alternatives to plastics could also be made out of sustainable, less harmful and even regenerative materials, such as seaweed, Kaufman said. There has been progress on this front, but most solutions have not scaled up yet.",

      "Across the world, the faithful are known as Rastafarians, members of the movement launched in 1930 with the coronation in Ethiopia of Ras Tafari Mekonnen as Emperor Haile Selassie I. Rastafarians believe Selassie was the final incarnation of the biblical Jesus, and during his reign many Rastafarians made pilgrimage to the Horn of Africa nation. For Rastafarians, Ethiopia was a symbol of pride for its unbroken resistance to colonizers and Selassie was Jah, the deity.",

      "In Kenya, the movement is set up under three \u201cmansions\u201d or branches: Nyabinghi, Bobo Ashanti and The Twelve tribes of Israel. The \u201cmansions\u201d represent small groups of Rastafarians who meet to worship together. Unlike traditional places of worship that are housed in architect-designed permanent structures, a Rastafari tabernacle is built with wooden poles, roofed with iron sheets and decorated in the unmistakable Rastafari colors of red, yellow and green.",
      "Rastafarians around the world have a reputation for their unique Afrocentric spirituality, and they are generally known to be peace advocates. They oppose oppression and gravitate to music and art. The Jamaican reggae singer Bob Marley was a famous Rastafari.",
      "There are challenges, including those that stem from misunderstandings about the religion.

      "CAIRO -- When Ahlam Saeed awoke last month to the sound of gunfire and roaring vehicle motors, the 43-year-old widow rushed outside her home in war-torn Sudan to find a line of at least two dozen vehicles, many of them motorcycles carrying armed fighters.",
      "\u201cThey were firing at everything and in every direction,\u201d the mother of four said. \u201cIn an instant, all of us in the village were fleeing for safety.\" Many people were gunned down in their houses or while trying to flee. At least 200 people were killed, including many women and children, in the community of straw homes, according to a rights group tracking Sudan\u2019s civil war.",
      "Saeed and her children \u2014 ages 9 to 15 \u2014 were among those who survived after rebel fighters rampaged through Shag al-Num, the small farming village of several thousand people in Sudan\u2019s Kordofan region. In interviews with The Associated Press, Saeed and four other villagers described the July 12 attack, one of the deadliest assaults since the war began more than two years ago over a power struggle between commanders of the military and the rival paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF.",
      "The villagers' accounts add to the devastating toll of the conflict, which started in April 2023 and has wrecked the country in northeastern African. The fighting has killed more than 40,000 people, displaced as many as 14 million, caused disease outbreaks and pushed many places to the brink of famine.",
      "Atrocities, including mass killings of civilians and mass rape, have also been reported, particularly in Darfur, triggering an investigation by the International Criminal Court into potential war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "The villagers from Shag al-Num said RSF fighters and their allied Janjaweed militias stormed into the community, looting houses and robbing residents, especially of women\u2019s gold. Some victims were held at gunpoint.",
      "Some young villagers attempted to fight back by taking up rifles to defend their homes. The RSF fighters knocked them down and continued their rampage, witnesses said.",
      "\u201cIt was as if the hell\u2019s door was opened,\u201d Saeed said, sobbing. Her straw house and neighboring homes were burned down, and one RSF fighter seized her necklace. \u201cWe were dying of fear,\u201d she said.",
      "The villagers said the fighters also sexually abused or raped many women. One of the women said she saw three fighters wearing RSF uniforms dragging a young woman into an abandoned house. She said she later met the woman, who said she was raped.",
      "Satellite imagery from July 13 and 14 showed \u201cintentional arson attacks\u201d and \u201ca large smoke point\u201d over the village as well as \u201crazed and smoldering\u201d buildings, the Humanitarian Research Lab at the Yale School of Public Health reported.",

      "JERUSALEM -- U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee sought Wednesday to blame a recent breakdown in Gaza ceasefire talks on the decision by some European leaders to recognize Palestinian statehood.",
      "Talks over a lasting ceasefire have repeatedly stalled since the early months of the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack \u2014 and long before there was any talk of major European states recognizing Palestinian statehood.",
      "The decisions were announced by France, Britain and other countries after the Trump administration\u2019s Mideast envoy had already walked away in frustration from the negotiations, which happened behind closed doors. It's unclear how and when they began to break down.",
      "But Huckabee's remarks in an interview with The Associated Press point to a sharp divide among Western nations about how to approach the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the rift has only deepened since President Donald Trump took office.",
      "Many European countries have sought to pressure Israel \u2014 the stronger party \u2014 and frame the pursuit of a two-state solution as a way to address the root causes of a conflict that long predates the war in Gaza. But the Trump administration has given Israel wide latitude to end the war on its terms.",
      "The White House fully supported Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s decision to end an earlier ceasefire that Trump had helped broker and resume wide-ranging military operations, during which Israel prevented food, medicine and other goods from entering Gaza for more than two months.",
      "Trump appears to have adopted Israel\u2019s position that further military pressure \u2014 including a planned offensive into some of the most densely populated areas of Gaza \u2014 will force Hamas to surrender.",
      "\u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed!!!\u201d Trump posted this week on his Truth Social site.",
      "Meanwhile, France, Britain and more than two dozen other Western-aligned nations have expressed mounting outrage at Israel\u2019s actions, demanding that it halt the fighting and do more to facilitate humanitarian aid. The moves to recognize Palestinians statehood \u2014 which were largely symbolic \u2014 were in part aimed at pressuring Israel to halt its offensive.",
      "Britain explicitly linked the two, saying it would hold off on recognizing a Palestinian state if Israel agreed to a ceasefire in Gaza, stopped building settlements in the West Bank and committed to a two-state solution.",
      "Israel's current government and most of its political class were opposed to Palestinian statehood even before the war, and they now say it would reward Hamas and allow the militants to eventually carry out more Oct. 7-style attacks.",
      "Huckabee, who is himself a longtime opponent of Palestinian statehood, said the \u201cnoise that has been made by European leaders recently ... is having the counterproductive effect that they probably think that they want.\"",
      "\u201cIf they believe that unilaterally calling for a two-state, a Palestinian state recognition, immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it\u2019s taking them further away,\u201d he said.",

      "The ceasefire talks have continued, with Hamas saying this week that it accepted a proposal from Arab mediators that is similar to an earlier one advanced by the U.S. and accepted by Israel. Israel and the U.S. have not yet responded to the offer.",
      "Huckabee said he could not elaborate on the talks beyond saying he would not trust that Hamas is serious until they \u201cput their signatures on it\u201d and that the group could be \u201cstringing this along,\u201d as the U.S. and Israel have alleged in the past.",

      "In Israel, many blame Netanyahu for the failure of the talks, accusing him of seeking to prolong the war in order to keep his far-right governing coalition intact. Hundreds of thousands took to the streets over the weekend to protest his planned offensive and call for a deal to return the captives.",

      "New Zealand's government has announced new military spending of $1.6 billion to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters from the United States",
      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 New Zealand 's government announced new military spending Thursday of 2.7 billion New Zealand dollars ($1.6 billion) to replace aging aircraft, including helicopters it plans to purchase from the United States, senior officials said.",
      "Cabinet ministers unveiling the package cited rapidly growing global tensions and a deteriorating security environment. New Zealand\u2019s military spending has trailed that of its larger partners in the Five Eyes intelligence sharing group of countries \u2014 which includes the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia \u2014 and the bolstered budget reflects a shift in how the remote island nation is responding to strategic competition among major powers in the Pacific Ocean.",
      "\u201cWe face the most challenging strategic circumstances in New Zealand\u2019s modern history and certainly the worst that anyone today working in politics or foreign affairs can remember,\u201d Foreign Minister Winston Peters, who entered Parliament in 1979, told reporters.",
      "The purchase of military planes and helicopters was the first procurement announced in a government plan, disclosed in April, to double defense spending from 1% to 2% of GDP in the next decade.",
      "The package includes five MH-60R Seahawk helicopters to replace the existing maritime fleet and two Airbus A321XLR aircraft, allowing the retirement of Boeing 757s that are more than 30 years old and were already secondhand when purchased. The helicopters accounted for more than NZ $2 billion of the spending, officials said.",
      "Defense Minister Judith Collins said her government would \u201cmove at pace\u201d to procure the helicopters directly through the United States' foreign military sales program instead of going to a wider tender. Cabinet ministers were expected to consider the final business case in 2026, she told reporters in Wellington on Thursday.",
      "It would take \u201ca few years\u201d to acquire the helicopters, Collins added, because buying new meant New Zealand would need to \u201cwait in line.\u201d She denied the choice to buy from the United States was an attempt to rectify the trade imbalance that has seen New Zealand goods targeted for an adjusted 15% levy when arriving in the U.S. under the Trump administration's global tariffs plan.",

      "The leaders of New Zealand and neighboring Australia this month pledged closer military ties as they are increasingly confronted by great power competition, particularly the rise of China's influence, in the South Pacific Ocean. The region was once neglected by other Western nations, an attitude that has reversed sharply in recent years as the extent of Beijing's attempts to vie for sway with Pacific leaders has become more apparent.",
      "That's proved a challenge for leaders in New Zealand, where use of military ships and aircraft has often been primarily in humanitarian and disaster situations. It has also required a fresh sales pitch on military budgets to a country of 5 million people where the need for defense spending in a remote country with few enemies has traditionally been a difficult sell.",

      "Bolsonaro is currently awaiting a Supreme Court ruling about an alleged coup attempt and learned Wednesday he might face another case as police formally accused him and one of his sons, Eduardo Bolsonaro, of obstruction of justice in connection with his trial.",
      "The 170-page report said Bolsonaro had drafted a request for political asylum from Argentine President Javier Milei\u2019s government dated Feb. 10, 2024. He saved the document two days after authorities searched his home and office as part of the alleged coup plot investigation.",

      "The AP reviewed the police evidence, which included messaging app exchanges and voice messages, after police forwarded the documents to Brazil\u2019s Supreme Court. Bolsonaro would face another trial if the attorney-general decides to charge him.",

      "In a 33-page letter addressed to Milei, Bolsonaro claimed he was being politically persecuted in Brazil. Both are staunch supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has recently repeated some of the former president's claims in his decision to impose 50% tariffs on Brazilian exports.",

The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication.

Despite her efforts, the two countries in late July engaged in five days of armed border clashes, resulting in dozens of deaths and the displacement of more than 260,000 people.",

      "NEW YORK -- The U.S. Federal Trade Commission is suing the operators of LA Fitness, over allegations that they make it \u201cexceedingly difficult\u201d for consumers to cancel gym memberships and other related services offered in their clubs nationwide.",
      "In a Wednesday complaint, the FTC accused Fitness International and its subsidiary Fitness & Sports Clubs of illegally charging consumers \u201chundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\u201d as a result of cumbersome cancellation processes. The agency said that tens of thousands of customers have reported difficulties with these policies to date.",
      "\u201cThe FTC\u2019s complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2014 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\u201d Christopher Mufarrige, director of the agency\u2019s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a statement.",
      "Beyond LA Fitness, California-based Fitness International operates brands like Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club, and Club Studio \u2014 spanning across more than 600 locations with over 3.7 million members nationwide. And the FTC pointed to two \u201cunfair and unlawful\u201d cancellation processes that it says these gyms have used for years: in-person cancellation or cancellation by mail.",
      "Both of these options require consumers to print out a form on the gym\u2019s website, which includes logging in with credentials that the agency says some customers don\u2019t have or remember. And if a customer opts for in-person cancellation, there\u2019s limited hours and often difficulty finding a manager to process the forms, the complaint notes \u2014 while mailing the form comes with additional costs.",
      "\u201cEach of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding \u2014 far from simple,\u201d the FTC writes in its complaint. It also alleges that the company doesn\u2019t adequately disclose cancellation offerings when consumers sign up for memberships, and that some will be signed up for additional services with recurring charges without realizing there may be different cancellation requirements.",

      "In its litigation against Fitness International, the FTC says it\u2019s seeking a court order prohibiting the allegedly unfair conduct and money back for consumers who were harmed by difficult cancellation processes.",

      "Ukraine's defense industry is gaining global attention for its innovative drone technology",
      "When a Ukrainian-made drone attacked an ammunition depot in Russia last September, it showcased Kyiv\u2019s determination to strike deep behind enemy lines and the prowess of its defense industry.",
      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",
      "\u201cFighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment. We don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.",
      "Terekh spoke as she surveyed dozens of \u201cdeep-strike drones\u201d that had recently come off the assembly line and would soon be used by Ukrainian forces to attack arms depots, oil refineries and other targets vital to the Kremlin\u2019s war machine and economy.",
      "Spurred by its existential fight against Russia \u2014 and limited military assistance from Western allies \u2014 Ukraine has fast become a global center for defense innovation. The goal is to match, if not outmuscle, Russia\u2019s capabilities \u2014 and Fire Point is one of the companies leading the way.",
      "The Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories. In a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). They also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.",
      "Even as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for an end to the 3 1/2-year war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of U.S. support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.",
      "\u201cWe believe our best guarantee is not relying on somebody\u2019s will to protect us, but rather our ability to protect ourselves,\u201d said Arsen Zhumadilov, the head of the country's arms procurement agency.",
      "Ukraine's government is now purchasing about $10 billion of weapons annually from domestic manufacturers. The industry has the capacity to sell triple that amount, officials say, and they believe sales to European allies could help it reach such potential in a matter of years.",
      "Like most defense companies in Ukraine, Fire Point grew out of necessity after Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022. Despite pleas from Ukrainian military officials, Western countries were unwilling to allow Kyiv to use their allies' longer-range weapons to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.",
      "That's when a group of close friends, experts from various fields, set out to mass-produce inexpensive drones that could match the potency of Iranian-made Shahed drones that Russia was firing into Ukraine with devastating consequences.",
      "The company's founders spoke with AP on the condition of anonymity out of concern for their safety and the security of their factories.",
      "By pooling together knowledge from construction, game design and architecture, the company's founders \u2014 who had no background in defense \u2014 came up with novel designs for drones that could fly further and strike with greater precision than most products already on the market. Their long-range drones had another benefit: they did not need to take off from an air field.",
      "When Terekh \u2014 an architect \u2014 was hired in the summer of 2023, she was given a goal of producing 30 drones per month. Now the company makes roughly 100 per day, at a cost of $55,000 apiece.",
      "The FP-1 looks more like a hastily made science project than something that would roll off the production lines of the world's biggest defense contractors. \u201cWe removed unneeded, flashy glittery stuff,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI think the best drones, or among the best, are Ukrainian drones,\" said Claude Chenuil, a former French military official who now works for a trade group that focuses on defense. \u201cWhen the war in Ukraine ends, they will flood the market.\u201d",
      "Fire Point\u2019s story is not entirely unique. Soon after Russia's 2022 invasion, hundreds of defense companies sprouted almost overnight. The Ukrainian government incentivized innovation by relaxing regulations and making it easier for startups to work directly with military brigades.",
      "Patriotic entrepreneurs in metallurgy, construction and information technology built facilities for researching and making weapons and munitions, with an emphasis on drones. The ongoing war allowed them to test out ideas almost immediately on the battlefield, and to quickly adapt to Russia\u2019s changing tactics.",
      "\u201cUkraine is in this very unique moment now where it is becoming, de facto, the Silicon Valley of defense,\u201d said Ukrainian defense entrepreneur Yaroslav Azhnyuk. \u201cThe biggest strategic asset that we have is that we have been at war with Russia for 11 years.\u201d",
      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",
      "On the day AP reporters visited the Fire Point factory, there were dozens of drones awaiting delivery. They would all be gone within 72 hours, shipped to the battlefield in inconspicuous cargo trucks.",
      "The Fire Point team receives regular feedback from army units, and the company has reinvested most profits toward innovating quickly to keep pace with other drone makers. Increasingly, those profits are being directed to develop a new, more potent weapon.",
      "The company completed testing this year for its first cruise missile, the FP-5. Capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) and landing within 14 meters (45 feet) of its target, the FP-5 is one of the largest such missile in the world, delivering a payload of 1,150 kilograms (2,535 pounds), independent experts said. Because initial versions of the missile came out pink after a factory error, they called it the Flamingo \u2014 and the name has stuck.",
      "Fire Point is producing roughly one Flamingo per day, and by October they hope to build capacity to make seven per day, Terekh said.",
      "Even as Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials pursue ways to end the war, Terekh said she is skeptical that Russia will accept terms for a real peace. \u201cWe are preparing for a bigger, much scarier war.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Walmart Inc. reported increases in second-quarter profits and sales Thursday as it continues to pull in price-sensitive shoppers for everyday essentials like groceries despite a challenging tariff environment.",
      "The Bentonville, Arkansas-based company, the nation\u2019s largest retailer, also increased its annual profit and sales outlook. It\u2019s among the first group of major U.S. retailers this week to report quarterly results that should shed more light on how consumers are coping with rising prices because of higher tariff costs.",
      "The company said Thursday that it earned $7.03 billion, or 88 cents per share, for the three-month period ended July 31. That compares with $4.50 billion, or 56 cents per share, a year ago.",
      "Sales rose nearly 5% to $177.40 billion.",
      "A growing list of companies including Procter & Gamble, e.lf. Cosmetics, Black & Decker and Ralph Lauren have told investors in recent weeks that they plan to or have already raised prices because of tariffs, though modestly.",
      "None of that has derailed consumer spending. Shoppers spent at a healthy pace in July, particularly at the nation\u2019s auto dealerships, even as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs start to take a toll on jobs.",
      "However, some of that spending could have been shoppers buying furniture and other items to get ahead of the expected price increases, analysts said.",
      "On Tuesday, Home Depot, the nation\u2019s largest home improvement retailer, reported improved sales during its latest quarter as consumers remained focused on smaller projects amid cost concerns and economic uncertainty.",
      "But its performance missed Wall Street\u2019s expectations. The Atlanta-based company also said shoppers should expect modest price increases in some categories as a result of rising tariff costs, though they won\u2019t be broad-based.",
      "Target, which has been struggling to reverse a persistent sales malaise, announced a new CEO to take over in February. It reported another decline in comparable sales and said would only raise prices as a last resort. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez said shoppers are focusing on value and so the discounter is leaning more into its store label brands, which tend to be less expensive than its national labels.",
      "But it\u2019s Walmart that serves as a barometer of spending given its outsized power in the retailing landscape. Walmart maintains that 90% of American households rely on the retailer for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",

      "German prosecutors have announced the arrest of a Ukrainian citizen suspected to be one of the coordinators of the 2022 Nord Stream gas pipeline explosions",
      "BERLIN -- A Ukrainian citizen man suspected to be one of the coordinators of the undersea explosions in 2022 that damaged the Nord Stream gas pipelines between Russia and Germany has been arrested, German prosecutors said Thursday.",
      "The suspect, identified only as Serhii K. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested overnight by officers from a police station in Misano Adriatrico, near the Italian city of Rimini, federal prosecutors said.",
      "Explosions on Sept. 26, 2022, damaged the pipelines, which were built to carry Russian natural gas to Germany under the Baltic Sea. The damage added to tensions over the war in Ukraine as European countries moved to wean themselves off Russian energy sources, following the Kremlin\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Investigators have been largely tightlipped on their investigation, but said two years ago they found traces of undersea explosives in samples taken from a yacht that was searched as part of the probe.",
      "In a statement Thursday, prosecutors said Serhii K. was one of a group of people who placed explosives on the pipelines and is believed to have been one of the coordinators. They said he is suspected of causing explosions, anti-constitutional sabotage and the destruction of structures.",
      "The suspect and others used a yacht that set off from the German port of Rostock, which had been hired from a German company using forged IDs and with the help of intermediaries, prosecutors said.",
      "They didn't give any information on the other people aboard the yacht or say anything about who else might have been involved in coordinating the suspected sabotage.",

      "Bill Pulte, the head of the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and a Trump appointee, alleged on the X social media platform early Wednesday that Cook had claimed two primary residences -- in Ann Arbor, Michigan and Atlanta -- in 2021 to get better mortgage terms. Mortgage rates are often higher on second homes or those purchased to rent.",
      "Trump followed up Pulte's accusation by calling on Cook to resign, in the latest effort by the administration to exert greater control over one of the few remaining independent agencies in Washington. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Fed's chair, Jerome Powell, for not cutting its short-term interest rate, and even threatened to fire him.",
      "If Cook is forced off the Fed's governing board, it would provide Trump an opportunity to appoint a loyalist. Trump has said he would only appoint officials who would support cutting rates.",
      "Pulte urged the Justice Department to investigate Cook, who was appointed to the Fed\u2019s governing board by former president Joe Biden in 2022. She was reappointed the following year to a term that lasts until 2038, the longest remaining term among the seven governors.",
      "Cook also said, \u201cI do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.\u201d",
      "Pulte, in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi, said that on June 18, 2021, Cook purchased a home in Ann Arbor and then two weeks later bought a condo in Atlanta. Before joining the Fed, Cook taught at Michigan State University. Pulte also charged that Cook has listed her condo in Atlanta for rent.",
      "A Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.",
      "Just last month, Trump blasted Powell for the ballooning cost of the renovation of two of the Fed\u2019s headquarters buildings, even suggesting that the run-up in costs could constitute a firing offense. He backed off his threats to fire Powell after receiving a tour of the project.",
      "Pulte also suggested that Cook's alleged actions could constitute a fireable offense. Fed officials are protected by law from being removed by a president, except \u201cfor cause,\u201d which is generally seen as some kind of malfeasance or dereliction of duty.",
      "Either way, if Trump seeks to fire Cook, it could lead to a court battle over a president's power to remove Fed governors.",

Yet 12 members of the Fed's interest-rate setting committee have a vote on whether to raise or lower interest rates, so even replacing the Chair doesn't guarantee that Fed policy will shift the way Trump wants.",

      "NEW YORK -- Target CEO Brian Cornell, who helped reenergize the company but has struggled to turn around weak sales in a more competitive retail landscape since the COVID pandemic, plans to step down Feb. 1.",
      "Minneapolis-based Target Corp. said Wednesday that Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a 20-year company veteran, will succeed Cornell. Cornell will transition to be executive chair of the board.",
      "Cornell, 66, took the helm at Target in August 2014. In September 2022, the board extended his contract for three more years and eliminated a policy requiring its chief executives to retire at age 65.",
      "Cornell said the appointment followed several years of board vetting of both internal and external candidates. Fiddelke has overhauled Target\u2019s supply network and expanded the company\u2019s stores and digital services while cutting costs.",
      "\u201cMike was the right candidate to lead our business back to growth,\u201d Cornell told reporters. \u201cAs I arrived at Target, I consistently relied on Michael\u2019s strategic insights and sound judgment when making decisions. Michael has developed a deeper knowledge of our business than anyone I know.\u201d",
      "Fiddelke told reporters he\u2019s stepping into the role with \u201curgency\u201d to reclaim the company\u2019s merchandising authority.",
      "\u201cWhen we\u2019re leading with swagger in our merchandising authority, when we have swagger in our marketing, and we\u2019re setting the trend for retail, those are some of the moments I think that Target has been at its highest in my 20 years,\u201d he said.",
      "In May, Target announced that Fiddelke would lead a new office focused on faster decision-making to help accelerate sales growth.",
      "The change in leadership was announced Wednesday at the same time that Target reported another quarter of sluggish results. The company\u2019s stock was down more than 8% in pre-market trading.",
      "Target reported a 21% drop in net income in the quarter ended Aug. 2. Sales were down slightly and the company reported a 1.9% dip in comparable sales \u2014 those from established physical stores and online channels. Target has seen flat or declining comparable sales in eight out of the past 10 quarters including the latest period.",
      "Target, which has about 1,980 U.S. stores, has been the focus of consumer boycotts since late January, when it joined rival Walmart and a number of other prominent American brands in scaling back corporate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",
      "Target\u2019s sales also have languished as customers defect to Walmart and off-price department store chains like TJ Maxx in search of lower prices. But many analysts think Target is stumbling because consumers no longer consider it the place to go for affordable but stylish products, a niche that long ago earned the retailer the jokingly posh nickname \u201cTarzhay.\u201d",
      "In fact, out of 35 merchandise categories that Target tracks, it gained or maintaining market share in only 14 during the latest quarter, Fiddelke told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Meanwhile, Walmart gained market share among households with incomes over $100,000 as U.S. inflation caused consumer prices to rise rapidly. Lower-income shoppers have driven customer growth at Target, suggesting it may have lost appeal with wealthier customers, according to market research firm Consumer Edge.",

      "In March, members of Target\u2019s executive team told investors they planned to regain the chain\u2019s reputation for selling stylish goods at budget prices by expanding Target\u2019s lineup of store label brands and shortening the time it took to get new items from the idea stage to store shelves. The moves would help the company stay close to trends, executives said.",
      "\u201cIn a world where we operate today, our guests are looking for Tarzhay,\u201d Cornell told investors. \u201cConsumers coined that term decades ago to define how we elevate the everything everyday to something special, how we had unexpected fun in the shopping that would be otherwise routine.\u201d",
      "Before joining Target, Cornell spent more than 30 years in leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies, including as chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. and CEO at Michaels, Walmart\u2019s Sam\u2019s Club and PepsiCo America Foods. He came to Target when the company was facing a different set of challenges.",
      "Cornell replaced former CEO Gregg Steinhafel, who stepped down nearly five months after Target disclosed a huge data breach in which hackers stole millions of customers\u2019 credit- and debit-card records. The theft badly damaged the chain\u2019s reputation and profits.",
      "Cornell reenergized sales by having his team rev up Target\u2019s store brands. It now has 40 private label brands in its portfolio. And even before the pandemic, Cornell spearheaded the company\u2019s mission to transform its stores into delivery hubs to cut down on costs and speed up deliveries.",
      "Target\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Shipt helped bolster the discounter\u2019s same-day, store-based fulfillment services. Cornell also focused on making its stores better tailored to the local community",
      "The coronavirus pandemic delivered outsized sales for Target as well as its peers as people stayed home and bought pajamas, furnishings and kitchen items. And it continued to see a surge in sales as shoppers emerged from their homes and went to stores. But the spending sprees eventually subsided.",
      "As inflation started to spike, Target reported a 52% drop in profits during its 2022 first quarter compared with a year earlier. Purchases of big TVs and appliances that Americans loaded up on during the pandemic faded, leaving the retailer with excess inventory that had to be sold off.",
      "In July 2023, as shoppers feeling pinched by inflation curtailed their spending, Target said its comparable sales declined for the first time in six years.",
      "Moreover, Target started losing its edge as an authority on style by focusing too much on home furnishings basics, and not enough trendy items, Fiddelke said.",
      "A customer backlash over the annual line of LGBTQ+ Pride merchandise Target stores carried that year further cut into sales.",
      "Although Walmart retreated from its diversity initiatives first, Target has been the focus of more concerted consumer boycotts. Organizers have said they viewed Target\u2019s action as a greater betrayal because the company previously had held itself out as a champion of inclusion.",

      "A train derails and spills at least 1,000 gallons of hazardous materials in the U.S. about once every two months. Nearly half of those derailments resulted in evacuations; more than a quarter resulted in a fire or explosion since 2015, an analysis of federal derailment data showed.",
      "And many communities along the rail lines aren\u2019t prepared to keep people safe when it happens.",
      "That\u2019s the finding of an investigation by the University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism that reviewed hundreds of rail safety documents and reports and interviewed dozens of industry professionals and first responders.",
      "The Howard Center also obtained unprecedented access to rail data collected by a network of AI-enhanced camera sensors, which allowed reporters to track shipments of hazardous materials along 2,200 miles of rail lines between the U.S.-Canadian border and West Texas.",
      "That data, provided by a private company called RailState LLC, showed that over the last six months at least 130,000 rail cars displaying placards for hazardous materials moved along sections of rail lines stretching from Blaine, Washington, to Amarillo, Texas. Those cars passed the homes of at least 2.5 million people living within a mile of the tracks, along with more than 1,000 schools and 80 hospitals, the analysis found.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that most communities are probably not aware of what chemicals are going up and down the railroads in their backyard, day in and day out,\u2019\u201d said Jamie Burgess, a hazmat training director at the International Association of Firefighters.",
      "First responders often lack the information, training, equipment and detailed planning needed to safely respond in the immediate aftermath of a hazmat derailment.",
      "Fewer than one in five fire departments nationwide have their own team of hazmat specialists, according to the U.S. Fire Administration.",
      "Confronted with a catastrophic hazmat derailment, local firefighters rely on a web of mutual support \u2014 from nearby departments, regional hazmat teams, state and federal officials, and railroad contractors \u2014 for the expertise and equipment they may lack. Yet those teams might be hours away, leaving firefighters to handle the unfolding crisis on their own.",
      "After a Norfolk Southern train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023, it took more than an hour for firefighters with specialized hazmat training to arrive at the scene.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s usually the first time that they\u2019ve ever dealt with something like this, and they\u2019re overwhelmed in the beginning,\u201d said Paul Stancil, who recently left his job as a senior hazardous materials accident investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board. \u201cThat was a problem in East Palestine. It\u2019s a problem in almost every site.\u201d",
      "In 2024, railroad industry-funded hazmat training initiatives reached at least 80,000 first responders, according to industry estimates. But this represents just a fraction of the estimated 1 million career and volunteer firefighters in the U.S, according to U.S. Fire Administration numbers.",
      "Jessica Kahanek, a spokesperson for the Association of American Railroads, said rail is the safest way to transport hazardous materials over land, adding that U.S. railroads safely carried more than 2 million hazardous material shipments in 2024.",
      "The Howard Center analysis of federal data found 57 derailments in the last decade that resulted in the release of at least 1,000 gallons (3,800 liters) of hazardous material. Twenty-six of those derailments resulted in evacuations; 16 caused fires or an explosion.",
      "When such derailments occur, firefighters called to the scene often face a critical problem: Many don\u2019t know what chemicals are on board the train and what the exposure risks might be. And federal regulators have delayed the requirement to immediately supply that information.",
      "In a letter to federal regulators this month, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick criticized the delay and urged regulators to enforce a stricter timeline on railroads.",
      "\u201cThe 2023 East Palestine derailment in my village highlighted a critical lack of timely communication with public safety about hazardous materials information involved in rail emergencies,\u201d Drabick wrote. Without strict enforcement by regulators, he added, \u201cI am concerned that the derailment in my community could be repeated.\u201d",
      "When communities are unprepared for a hazmat spill, the consequences can be dire.",
      "In 2012, a derailment in Paulsboro, New Jersey, sent several tank cars carrying vinyl chloride \u2014 a highly toxic and flammable chemical \u2014 plunging into a creek. One of the tank cars broke open, spewing a cloud of toxic gas that engulfed the surrounding area.",
      "Local police and volunteer firefighters, initially confused about the chemical released, approached the wreck without breathing protection \u2014 even standing in the cloud. The initial evacuation area was too small, investigators later found, and many nearby residents spent hours in the exposure zone.",

The company spent nearly $57 million to buy the tickets and resold them on secondary marketplaces for approximately $64 million.",
      "For just one Taylor Swift concert, Key Investment Group allegedly used 49 different accounts to purchase 273 tickets, dramatically exceeding the Eras Tour\u2019s 2023 six-ticket purchase limit per event, the FTC said. Fans were so frustrated by the difficulty getting tickets for Swift's tour that the U.S. Senate wound up grilling Ticketmaster in a 2023 hearing.",

      "The team was put on the market last summer, soon after it won its record 18th NBA championship. Chisholm won the bidding in March with an offer that valued the franchise at more than $6.1 billion \u2014 a record price paid for an American professional sports team.",

      "Chisholm takes ownership of at least 51% of the team, with full control coming by 2028 at a price that could bring the total value to $7.3 billion. That\u2019s the highest price ever paid for a team in the four major North American sports, though a piece of the Los Angeles Lakers changed hands this summer at a price that would value the entire franchise at $10 billion.",

      "\u201cThis is about shaping the next era of the PGA Tour,\u201d Woods said in a social media post.",
      "Rolapp didn't have details on several issues he faces as he takes over for Commissioner Jay Monahan, including the future of a sport that has been splintered by Saudi money that created the rival LIV Golf League and lured away a number of top players.",
      "The PGA Tour's negotiations with the Public Investment Fund have stalled, and Rolapp did not make that sound as if it were a top priority when asked about the fans' desire to see all the best players together more often.",
      "\u201cI'm going to focus on what I can control,\u201d Rolapp said. \"I would offer to you that the best collection of golfers in the world are on the PGA Tour. I think there\u2019s a bunch of metrics that demonstrate that, from rankings to viewership to whatever you want to pick. I\u2019m going to lean into that and strengthen that.",
      "\u201cI will also say that to the extent we can do anything that\u2019s going to further strengthen the PGA Tour, we\u2019ll do that,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m interested in exploring whatever strengthens the PGA Tour.\u201d",

      "\u201cMy key takeaway when you boil all this down is that the strength of the PGA Tour is strong, but there\u2019s much more we need to do, much more we need to change for the benefit of fans, players and our partners,\u201d he said.",

      "The committee is a smaller version of the PGA Tour Enterprises board and policy board. Joining Epstein from the business side are board chairman Joe Gorder and John Henry of Fenway Sports Group, who leads the Strategic Sports Group that invested $1.5 billion \u2014 with the potential to double that \u2014 into the tour in a minority investment announced 18 months ago.",

      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR in 2026 will race on a new street course in San Diego, return Chicagoland Speedway to the schedule, move the All-Star race to Dover, Delaware, and end its 38-race season back at Homestead-Miami Speedway.",
      "The schedule released Wednesday includes two off weekends on a calendar that stretches from February to November. It begins with the exhibition Clash on Feb. 1 at Bowman-Gray Stadium in Winston-Salem for the second consecutive year, with the season-opening Daytona 500 to follow on Feb. 15.",
      "The season ends Nov. 8 in Florida at Homestead, which hosted the championship-deciding finale for 18 consecutive years before NASCAR shifted it to Phoenix Raceway in 2020. The race at Phoenix was given a different date in the playoffs and NASCAR is expected to rotate the season finale to various venues in ensuing years.",
      "Chicagoland is reopening after a six-year hiatus and a switch back to the track located in suburban Joliet after three seasons on a temporary street circuit in downtown Chicago. The San Diego event will be held on a military base in Coronado.",
      "To add Chicagoland and San Diego, NASCAR dropped the Chicago street race and will not return to Mexico City, where it held the first international Cup Series points race since the 1950s. A return to Mexico City in 2026 became difficult to schedule because of soccer's World Cup.",
      "NASCAR also moved Watkins Glen in New York from its traditional August date to Mother's Day weekend and the all-star race from North Wilkesboro, North Carolina, to Dover so that North Wilkesboro will be a points-paying Cup race, and New Hampshire lost its playoff race to become the penultimate race of the regular season.",

      "The clock is ticking until Cadillac joins the Formula 1 grid. Literally.",
      "\u201cOn the wall of every office that we have is a countdown clock,\u201d team principal Graeme Lowdon told The Associated Press in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s counting down to two things.\u201d",
      "One is the first \u201cfire-up\u201d of the car with its engine, and then the other is free practice at Cadillac's first official F1 session in Melbourne, Australia in March next year.",
      "It will be the start of a new mission for General Motors, and the end of a process to join F1 which included years of negotiations, a change of name and leadership, even a U.S. Justice Department investigation.",
      "As a British racing boss creating an American team, Lowdon feels like an \u201cinverse Ted Lasso,\u201d the fictional U.S. soccer coach in London.",
      "Hired in part for his experience navigating the sport's complex process for approving new teams, Lowdon says he's worked hard to adapt to U.S. racing culture for a team which will build its cars out of Fishers, Indiana.",
      "There's also a design and manufacturing site near the British Grand Prix track at Silverstone, but Cadillac has a vision of running an \u201cAmerican team,\u201d Lowdon said. The idea is to get as many different perspectives on designing a race car as possible.",
      "\u201cFormula 1 is a very creative business,\u201d Lowdon said. \"With diversity of thought comes innovation and hopefully lap time.\"",
      "Past attempts to operate an F1 team outside of the sport's heartlands in England and Italy have rarely worked. Cadillac is taking lessons from the 1960s space race.",
      "Rather than read a list of racing failures, Lowdon looked for non-F1 projects with \u201cimmovable deadlines, huge amount of public scrutiny, multiple sites, highly technical,\" he said. \u201cThe best example I could find were the the Apollo missions.\u201d",
      "\u201cI looked a lot into how NASA had done the management structure of the business. I thought there were some very clever things that they did that we could build into a new design of a Formula 1 team, a complete new way of managing it. The primary objective was to maximize peer-to-peer communication between engineers.\u201d",

      "There are \u201cthree or four\u201d names on Cadillac's shortlist halfway through the 2025 season and Lowdon says Cadillac has more leverage in contract discussions than usual.",

      "The new team could be a way back to F1 for drivers like Sergio Perez, Valtteri Bottas or Zhou Guanyu who lost their race seats for 2025. There's also been speculation about various Americans and ex-F1 drivers like Mick Schumacher.",

It was very clear that everyone wants to drive a Cadillac and so I guess Valtteri has just made it even more clear.\u201d",

      "\u201cWorld Boxing respects the dignity of all individuals and is keen to ensure it is as inclusive as possible,\u201d World Boxing president Boris Van Der Vorst said. \u201cYet in a combat sport like boxing, we have a duty of care to deliver safety and competitiveness fairness, which are the key principles that have guided the development and creation of this policy.\u201d",
      "Paris Olympic champion Imane Khelif of Algeria declined to enter a World Boxing tournament in the Netherlands in June, shortly after the governing body initially announced its plans to introduce sex testing. Van Der Vorst later apologized for specifically naming Khelif, who initially planned to fight in the tournament, while outlining World Boxing's future testing plans.",
      "Khelif and fellow gold medalist Lin Yu-ting from Taiwan excelled in Paris under a harsh spotlight of widespread scrutiny and misconception about their sex. The 26-year-old Khelif repeatedly has said she was born a woman, and she has competed at all levels of women's amateur boxing for nearly a decade.",
      "Chromosome testing was common in Olympic sports during the 20th century but was largely abandoned in the 1990s because of numerous ambiguities that couldn\u2019t be easily resolved by the tests, collectively known as differences in sex development. Many sports switched to hormone testing to determine sex eligibility, but those tests require governing bodies to make difficult decisions on the eligibility of women with naturally high testosterone levels.",
      "World Boxing said athletes with DSD in which male androgenization occurs will be eligible to compete only in the men's category.",

      "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Recalling the damage her now-arrested coach inflicted on her and many of her gymnast friends, Finley Weldon said she feels a sense of pride.",
      "Free from the grip that Sean Gardner had during her years of training at an Iowa academy known for producing Olympians, Weldon told The Associated Press in an exclusive interview that she is among the few who survived his abuse and are still in the sport.",
      "The 18-year-old is heading into her freshman year at Iowa State University, where she\u2019ll be a member of the Cyclones gymnastics team. She spoke with the AP on Wednesday, less than a week after Gardner was arrested on a child sexual exploitation charge.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want him to take away anything from me, especially something that I love,\u201d she said. \u201cNone of the girls that I started with or went through the things that I did with Sean are still doing gymnastics today. So that\u2019s something I\u2019m very proud of.\u201d",

      "The AP generally does not identify victims of sexual abuse, but Weldon said she wanted \u201cmy name out there because I was the one who did come forward.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt like I needed to speak out to stop it from happening to other little girls, so they didn\u2019t have to go through what I went through,\u201d Weldon said.",
      "\u201cI knew it would just be a continuous cycle if nobody did.\u201d",
      "The FBI said Tuesday it believes Gardner \u201ctargeted children\u201d while coaching at Chow\u2019s Gymnastics and Dance Institute in West Des Moines, and gyms in Mississippi and Louisiana where he worked dating back to 2004.",
      "Gardner, 38, didn\u2019t return AP messages left on his cellphone before his arrest, and has not entered a plea to the charge. A public defender who represented him after his arrest hasn\u2019t returned messages.",
      "Another former gymnast at Chow\u2019s, the academy known for producing Olympic gold medalists Shawn Johnson and Gabby Douglas, first reported sexual abuse allegations against Gardner to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March 2022, alleging he fondled her during training sessions, according to an FBI affidavit.",
      "That girl provided the names of six other of Gardner's potential victims, according to the affidavit. Weldon said she spoke with a SafeSport investigator about her abuse at the time.",
      "SafeSport, a watchdog created after the Nassar scandal to investigate misconduct complaints, informed the West Des Moines Police Department about the allegations. It suspended Gardner from coaching or having contact with any gymnasts in July 2022.",

      "Weldon said police never reached out to her in 2022 but she's unsure whether she would have wanted to press charges then. She said she came forward in April 2024 at age 16 after she matured and began to realize the severity of her abuse.",
      "She praised police for doing \u201can amazing job\u201d keeping her informed about the progress of the case.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely taken awhile, but I mean, even I didn\u2019t realize how many steps there would be to charge him with anything,\u201d she said.",

      "Weldon said she was struggling as her parents went through a divorce and her father was largely absent from her life. She said Gardner sought to fill that role by telling her she could tell him \u201canything\u201d and that he would always be there for her.",
      "In hindsight, she said he was manipulating her in order to gain her trust.",
      "Finley's mother, Julie Weldon, said she heard concerns about Gardner from other parents at Chow\u2019s early on and asked her daughter whether her coach had ever done anything inappropriate. Finley said she falsely told her mother no because she was protecting the \u201cmale figure in my life.\u201d",
      "She said Gardner began touching her inappropriately in 2019 during lessons, beginning with long hugs and pats on the back. She said his behavior progressed, and he began touching her butt during the hugs and requiring her to stretch for extended periods in positions that exposed her vagina and anus out of her leotard.",
      "She said around 2020 he began touching her vagina while spotting her during exercises. She recalled once telling him not to put his hands there and he claimed it was an accident because her \u201cleotard was slippery.\u201d",
      "Weldon recalled reaching her breaking point with Gardner after a 2021 training in which he yelled and threw shoes at her, telling her she\u2019d never reach elite status. She said she walked out and told her mom she wanted to quit.",
      "She said many of her classmates quit or didn't return because of Gardner's conduct after the gym shut down during the pandemic. But while he made her hate gymnastics at times, she continued training when her family moved to Texas and then to Utah. She said she eventually proved Gardner wrong by earning elite status and a spot on a Division 1 team.",
      "After news of Gardner\u2019s arrest, Weldon saw his jail booking photo in the AP story. She said she was struck by how much heavier and unkempt he appeared.",
      "\u201cHe's definitely like gone through a spiral,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he probably just had so much guilt built up in him that he kind of turned into that.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori weren't even sure they would get to defend their U.S. Open mixed doubles title. Organizers revamped the tournament because they wanted singles superstars, not doubles specialists.",
      "They not only made it back to New York, they made it back to the top.",
      "The Italians beat No. 3 seeds Iga Swiatek and Casper Ruud 6-3, 5-7 (10-6) on Wednesday night, winning four matches over two days to earn $1 million\u2014 a huge raise over their earnings in New York last year in a format that looked nothing like this one.",
      "Errani and Vavassori were among the many critics of the changes to the event that shut out every other traditional doubles pairing, but had nothing but smiles \u2014 and plenty of hugs \u2014 after building a quick lead in the match tiebreaker and holding on in front of a large crowd inside Arthur Ashe Stadium.",
      "\u201cI think it was important for us to play,\u201d Vavassori said. \u201cLike, I have to say the initiative was also important because it was really a statement that doubles can become something better. The stadium was packed. The people were enjoying it. If something doesn\u2019t work \u2014 like, we showed today that it\u2019s working. Like, the people were going crazy.\u201d",
      "It was a setting rarely enjoyed by doubles players and what U.S. Open organizers sought when they overhauled their tournament, moving it to well before singles play starts Sunday in hopes that tennis' best-known players would play.",
      "Many of them did. But in the end, the event belonged to the doubles duo.",
      "Eight teams in the 16-team field qualified by their players\u2019 combined singles rankings, with the remaining teams given wild cards. Errani doubted the Italians were going to get one.",
      "They eventually did and became the first repeat mixed doubles champions in Flushing Meadows since Bethanie Mattek-Sands and Jamie Murray in 2018-19. Both repeatedly said they were representing the many doubles players who never had the chance to come to New York with them this year.",
      "\u201cI think this one is also for them,\u201d Errani said.",
      "The event drew past U.S. Open singles champions Carlos Alcaraz, Emma Raducanu, Novak Djokovic, Naomi Osaka and Daniil Medvedev, all of whom lost on the first day. Even without them, almost all the seats were full for the three matches Wednesday night in Arthur Ashe Stadium, with the roof closed after it rained most of the afternoon.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",

      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- President Donald Trump wants the U.S. government to own a piece of Intel, less than two weeks after demanding the Silicon Valley pioneer dump the CEO that was hired to turn around the slumping chipmaker. If the goal is realized, the investment would deepen the Trump administration's involvement in the computer industry as the president ramps up the pressure for more U.S. companies to manufacture products domestically instead of relying on overseas suppliers.",
      "The Trump administration is in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "That's what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn't commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",

      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration\u2019s CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn\u2019t been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program \u2014 money that Lutnick derided as a \u201cgiveaway\u201d that would better serve U.S. taxpayers if it\u2019s turned into Intel stock. \u201cWe think America should get the benefit of the bargain,\u201d Lutnick told CNBC. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that it\u2019s the right move to make.\u201d",

      "Google on Wednesday unveiled a new line-up of Pixel smartphones injected with another dose of artificial intelligence that's designed to do everything from fetch vital information stored on the devices to help improve photos as they're being taken.",
      "The AI expansion on the four Pixel 10 models amplifies Google's efforts to broaden the use of a technology that is already starting to reshape society. At the same time, Google is taking a swipe at Apple's Achilles' heel on the iPhone.",
      "Apple so far has only been able to introduce a few basic AI features on the iPhone while failing to deliver on last year\u2019s promise to deliver a more conversational and versatile version of its often-blundering virtual assistant Siri.",
      "Without mentioning the iPhone by name, Google has already been mocking Apple\u2019s missteps in online ads promoting the four new Pixel models as smartphones loaded with AI technology that consumers won\u2019t have to wait for more than a year to arrive.",
      "Google, in contrast, has been steadily increasing the amount of AI that it began to implant on its Pixels since 2023, with this year\u2019s models taking it to another level.",
      "Taking advantage of a more advanced processor, Google is introducing a new AI feature on the Pixel 10 phones called \u201cMagic Cue\u201d that\u2019s designed to serve as a digital mind reader that automatically fetches information stored on the devices and displays the data at the time it\u2019s needed. For instance, if a Pixel 10 user is calling up an airline, Magic Cue is supposed to instantaneously recognize the phone number and display the flight information if it\u2019s in Gmail or a Google Calendar.",
      "The Pixel 10 phones will also come with a preview feature of a new AI tool called \u201cCamera Coach\u201d that will automatically suggest the best framing and lighting angle as the lens is being aimed at a subject. Camera Coach will also recommend the best lens mode to use for an optimal picture.",
      "The premium models \u2014 Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 will also include a \u201cSuper Res\u201d option that deploys a grab bag of software and AI tricks to zoom up to 100 times the resolution to capture the details of objects located miles away from the camera. The AI wizardry could happen without users even realizing it\u2019s happening, making it even more difficult to know whether an image captured in a photo reflects how things really looked at the time a picture was taken or was modified by technology.",
      "Google is also offering a free one-year subscription to its AI Pro plan to anyone who buys the more expensive Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL models in hopes of hooking more people on the Gemini toolkit it has assembled to compete against OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.",

All the Pixel 10s expect the foldable model will be in stores on August 28. The Pixel 10 Pro Fold will be available starting October 9.",
      "Although the Pixel smartphone remains a Lilliputian next to the Gulliverian stature of the iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy models, Google's ongoing advances in AI while holding the line on its marquee devices raise the competitive stakes.",
      "\u201cIn the age of AI, it is a true laboratory of innovation,\u201d Forrester Research analyst Thomas Husson said of the Pixel.",
      "Apple, in particular, will be facing more pressure than usual when it introduces the next-generation iPhone next month. Although the company has already said the smarter Siri won't be ready until next year at the earliest, Apple will still be expected to show some progress in AI to demonstrate the iPhone is adapting to technology's AI evolution rather than tilting toward gradual obsolescence. Clinging to a once-successful formula eventually sank the BlackBerry and its physical keyboard when the iPhone and its touch screen came along nearly 20 years ago.",
      "Apple's pricing of the next iPhone will also be under the spotlight, given that the devices are made in China and India \u2014 two of the prime targets in President Donald Trump's trade war.",
      "But Apple appeared to gain a reprieve from Trump's most onerous threats earlier this month by adding another $100 billion on top of an earlier $500 billion investment pledge to the U.S. The tariff relief may enable Apple to minimize or even avoid price increases for the iPhone, just as Google has done with the Pixel 10 models.",

      "As students start school this year, 17 states and the District of Columbia are imposing new cellphone restrictions",
      "Jamel Bishop is seeing a big change in his classrooms as he begins his senior year at Doss High School in Louisville, Kentucky, where cellphones are now banned during instructional time.",
      "In previous years, students often weren\u2019t paying attention and wasted class time by repeating questions, the teenager said. Now, teachers can provide \u201cmore one-on-one time for the students who actually need it.\u201d",
      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",
      "Both Democrats and Republicans have taken up the cause, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are bad for kids' mental health and take their focus away from learning, even as some researchers say the issue is less clear-cut.",
      "\u201cAnytime you have a bill that\u2019s passed in California and Florida, you know you\u2019re probably onto something that\u2019s pretty popular,\" Georgia state Rep. Scott Hilton, a Republican, told a forum on cellphone use last week in Atlanta.",
      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",
      "But there are drawbacks \u2014 like not being able to listen to music when working independently in class. \u201cI\u2019m kind of 50-50 on the situation because me, I use headphones to do my schoolwork. I listen to music to help focus,\u201d she said.",
      "In a survey of 125 Georgia school districts by Emory University researchers, parental resistance was cited as the top obstacle to regulating student use of social and digital media.",
      "Johnson\u2019s mother, Audrena Johnson, said she worries most about knowing her children are safe from violence at school. School messages about threats can be delayed and incomplete, she said, like when someone who wasn\u2019t a McNair student got into a fight on school property, which she learned about when her daughter texted her during the school day.",
      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

      "\u201cThey could focus more on teaching,\u201d Gazmararian said. \u201cThere were just not the disruptions.\u201d",
      "Another benefit: More positive interactions among students. \u201cThey were saying that kids are talking to each other in the hallways and in the cafeteria,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the classroom, there is a noticeably lower amount of discipline referrals.\u201d",

      "Regent Craft is testing a new type of winged passenger ferry on Narragansett Bay",
      "NORTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. -- The winged passenger ferry gliding over the surface of Narragansett Bay could be a new method of coastal transportation or a new kind of warship.",
      "Its maker, Regent Craft, is betting on both.",
      "Twelve quietly buzzing propellers line the 65-foot (20-meter) wingspan of Paladin, a sleek ship with an airplane's nose. It looks nothing like the sailboats and fishing trawlers it speeds past through New England's largest estuary.",
      "\u201cWe had this vision five years ago for a seaglider \u2014 something that is as fast as an aircraft and as easy to drive as a boat,\u201d said CEO Billy Thalheimer, jubilant after an hours-long test run of the new vessel.",
      "On a cloudy August morning, Thalheimer sat in the Paladin's cockpit and, for the first time, took control of his company's prototype craft to test its hydrofoils. The electric-powered watercraft has three modes \u2014 float, foil and fly.",
      "From the dock, it sets off like any motorized boat. Farther away from land, it rises up on hydrofoils \u2014 the same kind used by sailing ships that compete in America\u2019s Cup. The foils enable it to travel more than 50 miles per hour \u2014 and about a person's height \u2014 above the bay.",
      "What makes this vessel so unusual is that it's designed to soar about 30 feet (10 meters) above the water at up to 180 miles per hour \u2014 a feat that hasn't quite happened yet, with the first trial flights off Rhode Island's seacoast planned for the end of summer or early fall.",
      "If successful, the Paladin will coast on a cushion of air over Rhode Island Sound, lifting with the same \u201cground effect\u201d that pelicans, cormorants and other birds use to conserve energy as they swiftly glide over the sea. It could zoom to New York City \u2014 which takes at least three hours by train and longer on traffic-clogged freeways \u2014 in just an hour.",
      "As it works to prove its seaworthiness to the U.S. Coast Guard and other regulators around the world, Regent is already lining up future customers for commercial ferry routes around Florida, Hawaii, Japan and the Persian Gulf.",
      "Regent is also working with the U.S. Marines to repurpose the same vessels for island-hopping troops in the Pacific. Those vessels would likely trade electric battery power for jet fuel to cover longer journeys.",
      "With backing from influential investors including Peter Thiel and Mark Cuban, Thalheimer says he\u2019s trying to use new technology to revive the \u201ccomfort and refined nature\u201d of 1930s-era flying boats that were popular in aviation\u2019s golden age before they were eclipsed by commercial airlines.",
      "This time, Thalheimer added, they're safer, quieter and emission-free.",
      "\u201cI thought they made travel easier in a way that made total sense to me,\u201d Cuban said by email this week. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to travel around water for short distances. It\u2019s expensive and a hassle. Regent can solve this problem and make that travel fun, easy and efficient.\u201d",
      "Co-founders and friends Thalheimer, a skilled sailor, and chief technology officer Mike Klinker, who grew up lobster fishing, met while both were freshmen at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and later worked together at Boeing. They started Regent in 2020.",
      "They've already tested and flown a smaller model. But the much bigger, 12-passenger Paladin \u2014 prototype of a product line called Viceroy \u2014 began foil testing this summer after years of engineering research and development. A manufacturing facility is under construction nearby, with the vessels set to carry passengers by 2027.",
      "The International Maritime Organization classifies \u201cwing-in-ground-effect\u201d vehicles such as Regent's as ships, not aircraft. But a database of civilian ships kept by the London-based organization lists only six around the world, all of them built before it issued new safety guidance on such craft in 2018 following revisions sought by China, France and Russia.",

      "One of the biggest technical challenges in Regent's design is the shift from foiling to flying. Hydrofoils are fast for a seafaring vessel, but far slower than the speeds needed to lift a conventional airplane from a runway.",
      "That's where air blown by the 12 propellers comes in, effectively tricking the wing into generating high lift at low speeds.",
      "All of this has worked perfectly on the computer simulations at Regent's headquarters in North Kingstown, Rhode Island. The next step is testing it over the water.",
      "For decades, the only warship known to mimic such a ground-effect design was the Soviet Union's hulking ekranoplan, which was built to fly under radar detection but never widely used. Recently, however, social media images of an apparent Chinese military ekranoplan have caught the attention of naval experts amid increasingly tense international disputes in the South China Sea.",
      "Regent has capitalized on those concerns, pitching its gliders to the U.S. government as a new method for carrying troops and cargo across island chains in the Indo-Pacific region. It could also do clandestine intelligence collection, anti-submarine warfare and be a \u201cmothership\u201d for small drones, autonomous watercraft or medical evacuations, said Tom Huntley, head of Regent's government relations and defense division.",
      "They fly below radar and above sonar, which makes them \u201creally hard to see,\u201d Huntley said.",
      "While the U.S. military has shown increasing interest, questions remain about their detectability, as well as their stability in various sea states and wind conditions, and their \"cost at scale beyond a few prototypes and maintainability,\u201d said retired U.S. Navy Capt. Paul S. Schmitt, an associate research professor at the Naval War College, across the bay in Newport, Rhode Island.",
      "Schmitt, who has seen Paladin from afar while sailing, said he also has questions about what kind of military mission would fit Regent's \u201crelatively short range and small transport capacity.\"",
      "The possibilities that most excite Cuban and other Regent backers are commercial.",
      "Driving Interstate 95 through all the cities that span Florida's Atlantic Coast can take the better part of a day, which is one reason why Regent is pitching Miami as a hub for its coastal ferry trips.",
      "The Viceroy seagliders can already carry more passengers than the typical seaplane or helicopter, but a growing number of electric hydrofoil startups, such as Sweden's Candela and California-based Navier, are trying to stake out ferry routes around the world.",
      "Thalheimer sees his vehicles as more of a complement than a competitor to electric hydrofoils that can't travel as fast, since they will all use the same docks and charging infrastructure but could specialize in different trip lengths.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.",
      "Researchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups \u2014 Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.",
      "Key studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN\u2019s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.",
      "Naming different giraffes matters because \u201ceach species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.\u201d",
      "Northern giraffes \u2014 whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.",
      "Considering four giraffe species \u201cis absolutely the right decision, and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis.",
      "While in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes\u2019 spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.",
      "What appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.",
      "Over the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

      "Hurricane Erin is creating potentially deadly water conditions all along the U.S. East Coast days before the largest waves are expected, with high winds and waves anticipated in North Carolina by Wednesday night.",
      "Erin lost some strength Tuesday and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves northward roughly parallel to the East Coast. However it could get stronger again on Thursday before finally weakening by Friday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) as of Wednesday morning.",
      "The hurricane was about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 560 miles ( 901 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda as of Wednesday morning. Forecasters said Erin was moving north-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).",
      "Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Beachgoers were cautioned against swimming due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.",
      "Officials on a few islands along North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks issued evacuation orders and warned that some roads could be swamped by waves of 15 feet (4.6 meters).",
      "In the Caribbean, heavy rainfall was forecast for parts of the southeast Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands, the weather center said.",
      "Here is what to know about Hurricane Erin:",
      "Erin poses the biggest threat to the barrier islands of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday in advance of the storm, delegating powers to government officials to mobilize workers and equipment along the coast.",
      "The governor said the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to the state. Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Wednesday.",
      "At least 75 people were rescued from rip currents through Tuesday in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, officials said.",
      "Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.",
      "Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida all the way up to the New England coast.",
      "Nantucket is the closest spot in New England to Erin\u2019s anticipated path and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).",
      "Citing treacherous waters, officials prohibited swimming at all beaches in New York City as well as some in Long Island and New Jersey through Thursday.",
      "Bermuda won\u2019t feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island\u2019s services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. Storm surge could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, Adams said.",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",

      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",

      "Lawyers for the media giant Meta says a lawsuit brought by families of the victims of the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, should be thrown out",
      "LOS ANGELES -- A lawsuit filed by families of the Uvalde school shooting victims alleging Instagram allowed gun manufacturers to promote firearms to minors should be thrown out, lawyers for Meta, Instagram's parent company, argued Tuesday.",
      "Nineteen children and two teachers were killed in the May 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas.",
      "The families sued Meta in Los Angeles in May 2024, saying the social media platform failed to enforce its own rules forbidding firearms advertisements aimed at minors. The families, who were present at last month's hearing, did not appear in court, with a lawyer citing the back-to-school season. Many plaintiffs attended the hearing virtually, he said.",
      "In one ad posted on Instagram, the Georgia-based gunmaker Daniel Defense shows Santa Claus holding an assault rifle. In another post by the same company, a rifle leans against a refrigerator, with the caption: \u201cLet\u2019s normalize kitchen Daniels. What Daniels do you use to protect your kitchen and home?\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges those posts are marketed toward minors. The Uvalde gunman opened an online account with Daniel Defense before his 18th birthday and purchased the rifle as soon as he could, according to the lawsuit. He also owned various Instagram accounts and had an \u201cobsessive relationship\u201d with the platform, at times opening the app more than 100 times a day, plaintiffs' lawyers found in an analysis of the shooter's phone.",
      "Meta attorney Kristin Linsley argued that the families provided no proof that minors, including the Uvalde gunman, even read the Daniel Defense posts on Instagram. She also said the posts didn't violate Meta\u2019s policies because they weren\u2019t direct advertisements and did not include links to purchase any products.",
      "Katie Mesner-Hage, representing the victims' families, said the defense\u2019s claim is \u201cfundamentally unfair,\u201d as the plaintiffs don\u2019t have access to Meta data that would indicate whether the shooter encountered those posts. She added that if the content had landed on the shooter\u2019s feed, as the plaintiffs allege, then Meta \u201cnot only knew about it, they designed the system so it would be delivered to him.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey knew more about him than anyone else on the planet,\u201d she said.",
      "Linsley said content advertising firearms for sale on Instagram is allowed if posted by \u201cbrick-and-motor and online retailers,\u201d but visibility of those posts was restricted for minors under Meta\u2019s advertising policies from the end of 2021 to October 2022.",
      "\u201cThis is not a playbook for how to violate the rules. This is actually what the rules are,\u201d Linsley said.",
      "The plaintiff\u2019s team, however, showed a fake profile they created for a 17-year-old boy earlier this month, through which they were able to search Daniel Defense\u2019s Instagram account and see a post that included a picture of a gun, as well as a link to the gun manufacturer\u2019s website.",
      "When the link was clicked, the gun-maker\u2019s website opened, and the team was able to select a firearm and add it to their cart, all within Instagram\u2019s app \u2014 an experiment that refutes Meta\u2019s assertion that posts relating to firearms aren\u2019t visible to users under 21, Mesner-Hage said.",

      "Linsley said in her rebuttal that the experiment was done this year and not in 2021 to 2022, which is when the policy she described was in effect.",
      "The families have also sued Daniel Defense and video game company Activision, which produces \u201cCall of Duty.\u201d",
      "Linsley said the Communications Decency Act allows social media platforms to moderate content without being treated as publishers of that content.",
      "\"The only response a company can have is to not have these kinds of rules at all,\" Linsley said. \u201cIt just gets you down a rabbit hole very quickly.\u201d",
      "Mesner-Hage argued Meta is not protected by the act because social media platforms don\u2019t just host speech, but help curate it through its algorithms. Daniel Defense, she said, didn't have to pay for ads to get free access to Meta's analytical data through its business account on Instagram. That data shows the company which age bracket and gender engaged most with a specific post.",
      "\u201cDaniel Defense is not on Instagram to make friends. ... They\u2019re on there to promote their product,\u201d Mesner-Hage said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a paid advertisement, but I would struggle to describe this as anything other than an advertisement.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit alleges that firearm companies tweaked their online marketing to comply with Meta's policies, including by avoiding the words \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201csell\u201d and not providing links to purchase, and that the social media company did not protect users against such strategies.",
      "Last month, lawyers for Activision also argued that legal proceedings against them should be thrown out, saying the families allegations are barred by the First Amendment. The families alleged that the war-themed video game Call of Duty trained and conditioned the Uvalde gunman to orchestrate his attack.",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs asked the judge to allow them to amend their lawsuit with the new information they presented Tuesday before ruling on the defense\u2019s motion. The defense claimed that was unnecessary, as the case would not have merit even with the amendments.",
      "The judge has yet to rule on Activision's motion and did not immediately rule on the Meta case.",

      "DENVER -- Arizona, Nevada and Mexico will again live with less water from the Colorado River as drought lingers in the West, federal officials announced Friday.",
      "The Colorado River is a critical lifeline to seven U.S. states, 30 Native American tribes, and two Mexican states. The cuts are based on projections for levels at federal reservoirs \u2014 chief among them Lake Powell and Lake Mead \u2014 released every August by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation.",
      "Arizona will again go without 18% of its total Colorado River allocation, while Mexico loses 5%. The reduction for Nevada \u2014 which receives far less water than Arizona, California or Mexico \u2014 will stay at 7%. California won't face any cuts because it has senior water rights and is the last to lose in times of shortage.",
      "Decades of overuse and the effects of long-term drought worsened by climate change means there\u2019s far more demand for water than what actually flows through the river. Low reservoir levels at Lake Mead have triggered mandatory cutbacks every year since 2022, with the deepest cuts in 2023, which hit farmers in Arizona the hardest.",
      "Meanwhile, the states are working to reach agreement by next year on new long-term rules to govern the river in dry years. The Trump administration gave a mid-November deadline for states to reach a preliminary agreement, or risk federal intervention. Negotiations have faced delays as states push back against how much water they should each give up.",
      "The original 1922 Colorado River Compact was calculated based on an amount of water that doesn't exist in today's climate. That leaves the Upper Basin states of New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming and Utah to share far less water after the required amount is sent to the to the \u201cLower Basin\u201d states of Nevada, Arizona and California. Lots of water is also lost to evaporation and leaky infrastructure.",
      "Fairly splitting the river's water in the era of climate change has been vexing for years, with all of the major users hesitant to give anything up as they anticipate a drier future. There has to be enough water in the reservoirs to reach the tunnels that usher water downstream, and ideally, even more water for hydropower generation. Key infrastructure like the Hoover Dam rely on certain water levels in Lake Mead to generate electricity.",
      "Mandatory cuts and emergency water releases are \u201creactive,\" said John Berggren, a regional policy manager at Western Resource Advocates, a nonprofit focused on climate change.",
      "\u201cIf we are going to be able to have a sustainable Colorado River and not just be responding to crisis after crisis, we need large amounts of flexibility built into this new set of guidelines,\" he said.",

      "In San Francisco Bay, salt ponds created more than a century ago are reverting to marshland. Along the New York and New Jersey coasts, beaches ravaged by Superstorm Sandy underwent extensive restoration. In Alabama, a rebuilt spit of land is shielding a historic town and providing wildlife habitat.",
      "Coastal communities nationwide are ramping up efforts to fend off rising seas, higher tides and stronger storm surges that are chewing away at coastlines, pushing saltwater farther inland and threatening ecosystems and communities.",
      "The need for coastal restoration has been in the spotlight this month after Louisiana officials canceled a $3 billion project because of objections from the fishing industry and concerns about rising costs. The Mid-Barataria project was projected to rebuild more than 20 square miles (32 square kilometers) of land over about 50 years by diverting sediment-laden water from the Mississippi River.",
      "But work continues on many other projects in Louisiana and around the country, including barrier islands, saltwater marshes, shellfish reefs and other natural features that provided protection before they were destroyed or degraded by development. Communities are also building flood walls, berms and levees to protect areas that lack adequate natural protection.",
      "The work has become more urgent as climate change causes more intense and destructive storms and leads to sea-level rise that puts hundreds of communities and tens of millions of people at risk, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe sooner we can make these coastlines more resilient the better,\u201d said Doug George, a geological oceanographer at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "In the U.S., perhaps nowhere is more vulnerable than the hurricane-prone Gulf Coast. Louisiana alone has lost more than 2,000 square miles (5,180 square kilometers) of coastline \u2014 more than any other state \u2014 over the past century, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Historically, sediment deposited by the Mississippi and other rivers rebuilt land and nourished shore-buffering marshes. But that function was disrupted by the construction of channels and levees, along with other development.",
      "The dangers were magnified in 2005 when Hurricane Katrina breached flood walls and levees, submerging 80% of New Orleans and killing almost 1,400 people \u2014 followed closely by Hurricane Rita.",
      "Afterward, the state formed the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to lessen risks from storm surges and stem land loss.",
      "Most of the almost $18 billion spent in the past 20 years was to shore up levees, flood walls and other structures, the authority said.",
      "Dozens of other projects are completed, planned or underway, including rebuilding marshes and other habitat with sediment dredged from waterways and restoring river flow to areas that have lacked it for years.",
      "On Louisiana\u2019s Chandeleur Islands, a barrier island chain, the state will pump in sand to help rebuild them, which will dampen storm surges and benefit sea turtles and other wildlife, said Katie Freer-Leonards, who leads development of the state\u2019s 2029 coastal master plan.",
      "The authority is digging a channel to allow water and sediment from the Mississippi River to flow into part of Maurepas Swamp, a roughly 218-square-mile forested wetland northwest of New Orleans that has been \u201cdying for over a century\u201d because of levees, project manager Brad Miller said.",
      "Sediment dredged from elsewhere also has been pumped into thousands of acres of sinking marshes to nourish them and raise their levels.",
      "The same is happening in other states.",
      "In Bayou La Batre, Alabama \u2014 a fishing village built in the late 1700s \u2014 The Nature Conservancy built breakwaters offshore, then pumped in sediment and built ridges, now covered with vegetation. That created a \u201cspeed bump\u201d that has helped protect the town from erosion, said Judy Haner, the Alabama Nature Conservancy\u2019s coastal programs director.",
      "The conservancy and others also have been creating miles of oyster reefs, and are acquiring tracts of land away from the coast to allow habitats to move as seawater encroaches.",

      "On the West Coast, communities vulnerable to sea-level rise also could see more flooding from increasingly intense atmospheric rivers, which carry water vapor from the ocean and dump huge amounts of rain in a short period of time.",
      "So tidal marshes and estuaries drained for agriculture and industry are being restored along the entire coast, both for habitat and coastal protection.",
      "Habitat restoration, not climate change, was the primary consideration when planning began about 20 years ago to restore marshland along the south end of San Francisco Bay, destroyed when ponds were created to harvest sea salt.",
      "But as sediment naturally fills in ponds and marsh plants return, \u201cwe're realizing that ... marshes absorb wave energy, storm surge and the force of high tides,\u201d said Dave Halsing, executive project manager at the California State Coastal Conservancy.",
      "That helps protect whatever is behind them, including sea walls and land that otherwise could be inundated or washed away, including some of California's most expensive real estate, near Silicon Valley.",
      "Projects also are underway along Alaska\u2019s coast and in Hawaii, where native residents are rebuilding ancient rocky enclosures originally intended to trap fish, but which also protect against storm surge.",
      "Thirteen years after Superstorm Sandy swamped the Atlantic coast, communities still are restoring natural buffers and building other protective structures.",
      "Sandy began as a fairly routine hurricane in the fall of 2012 before merging with other storms, stretching for a record 1,000 miles and pushing enormous amounts of ocean water into coastal communities.",
      "But the threat of future storm surges could be even greater because sea levels in some areas could rise as much as three feet within 50 years, said Donald E. Cresitello, a coastal engineer and senior coastal planner for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.",

      "Dr. Aqsa Durrani, an American physician who has been providing humanitarian work around the world for over 15 years, said amid the harrowing scenes of death and destruction in Gaza, one story especially sticks with her.",
      "Found injured and alone after an Israeli airstrike, a 4-year-old girl was taken to a trauma field hospital in central Gaza, she told ABC News.",
      "\"She was completely in shock. She was not talking and [a colleague] decided, 'I have to take this little girl home and I have try to see if I can help her find her family,'\" said Durrani, a pediatric ICU doctor and an epidemiologist who worked with Doctors Without Borders in Gaza earlier this year.",
      "Durrani, who said her colleagues are working in conditions that are \"incomprehensible,\" recently gained major attention for an interview on the digital platform \"Humans of New York.\"",
      "\"He has kids around her age. He tried to feed her, he tried have his kids play with her,\" Durrani told ABC News. \"She was completely non-emotive -- for days. And for those days, he tried to find her family.\"",
      "He looked in the area where the airstrike hit -- a location where displaced people were sheltering -- but he wasn't able to find her family there, according to Durrani.",
      "\"Finally, he said that he found a man who said that he had a niece that age and that they were staying in that area, so he brought him to her,\" Durrani said.",
      "\"He said that when she saw him, she yelled out 'ammo,' which means uncle in Arabic, and she ran to him and hugged him. And it was the first time [my colleague] had heard her speak,\" Durrani said.",
      "But this was only one child and it took days to find her family because they had been displaced multiple times, Durrani told ABC News.",
      "\"I said, 'It's so beautiful that you took her and you were able to reunite her with her uncle.' And he said, 'I have to do that. I have do that because I have to believe that someone will do that for me when this happens to me, or someone will do that for my children,'\" Durrani said.",
      "\"I think the story exemplifies every aspect of the horror that everyone is experiencing,\" Durrani said.",
      "Durrani was based in central Gaza -- working at a trauma field hospital there -- from Feb. 24 to April 24, witnessing the end of Israel's ceasefire agreement with Hamas and the weekslong blockade on all humanitarian aid.",
      "Field hospitals -- which are tents and semi-permanent structures -- were meant to offload existing hospitals. At the field hospital where Durrani worked, they were only able to provide care to injured or burn patients, she said.",
      "\"We could not possibly provide other services with the circumstances that we were in,\" Durrani said. \"We really had to keep it to lifesaving trauma service.\"",
      "\"Now, most of the patients that they're receiving are injured at these supposed aid-distribution sites. They are receiving now more patients with gunshot wounds, including children with gunshot wounds. Each day continues to get worse and we have just been witnessing this genocidal violence now for months and months and it's beyond anything that even our most experienced humanitarian colleagues can imagine,\" Durrani said.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces have previously said shooting incidents at aid sites were under review, but has also said in few instances that it fired \"warning shots\" toward people who were allegedly \"advancing while posing a threat to the troops.\"",
      "At least 2,018 have died trying to get humanitarian aid in Gaza and another 15,000 have been injured since May 28, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health.",

And just continue providing compassionate care to the patients as we continued down the line,\" Durrani said.",
      "Food was becoming more scarce toward the end of Durrani's time in Gaza, she said.",

      "A USAID analysis appeared to undercut Israeli assertions about the extent to which Hamas has allegedly stolen humanitarian aid. A presentation reviewed by ABC News, examining more than 150 reported incidents involving the theft or loss of U.S.-funded humanitarian aid in Gaza, showed that the group failed to find any evidence that Hamas engaged in widespread diversion of aid to cause the amount of hunger seen in the strip.",
      "Durrani said providing medical aid in the Gaza Strip was an experience unlike any other.",
      "\"It's dystopian, but it elicits a very visceral response. It's just completely unfathomable that it's actually, real, everything around you. I entered through the Karam Shalom crossing and we drove through Rafah and Rafah was at that point, even in late February, almost completely destroyed. It just looked like a dystopian reality,\" Durrani said.",

      "Reyt assumes his upcoming flight could be canceled \u2014 much like the scores of other lengthy disruptions this weekend. \u201cI\u2019m just very surprised that Air Canada let it go this far,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s really a bit disheartening that they fly you somewhere abroad and then they just don\u2019t fly you back.\u201d",
      "Jennifer MacDonald, of Halifax, Nova Scotia, expressed similar frustration. She has been trying to help her brother and cousin get home to Edmonton, Alberta since the second leg of their Air Canada trip was canceled during what was supposed to be a 1-hour layover in Montreal on Friday night.",
      "The two had to pay $300 out of their own pocket for a hotel, MacDonald said. All Saturday morning, they tried to look for rebooking options, but everything was sold out, she added. Eventually, they opted to book a new flight for Aug. 22 out of Halifax, with another family member volunteering to make an eight-hour drive to pick them up in Montreal and bring them back east on Saturday.",
      "\u201cIt will be a multiday ordeal and a multi thousand dollar trip,\u201d MacDonald said. But as stressful as the disruptions have been, she added that her family stands in solidarity with the flight attendants. \u201cWe hope that Air Canada lifts the lockout and negotiates fairly.\u201d",
      "Following the news of the Canadian government forcing arbitration on Saturday, Reyt also expressed concern for Air Canada\u2019s flight attendants. \u201cI think the flight attendants are making some reasonable arguments,\u201d he said, adding that he hopes the intervention isn't \"a way just to silence them.\u201d",

      "Texas' Republican-led legislature is expected to approve new congressional maps that add five new House seats that the GOP could win",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- The first domino in a growing national redistricting battle is likely to fall Wednesday as the Republican-controlled Texas legislature is expected to pass a new congressional map creating five new winnable seats for the GOP.",
      "The vote follows prodding by President Donald Trump, eager to stave off a midterm defeat that would deprive his party of control of the House of Representatives, and weeks of delays after dozens of Texas Democratic state lawmakers fled the state in protest. Some Democrats returned Monday, only to be assigned round-the-clock police escorts to ensure their attendance at Wednesday's session. Those who refused to be monitored were confined to the House floor, where they protested on a livestream Tuesday night.",
      "Furious national Democrats have vowed payback for the Texas map, with California's legislature poised to approve new maps adding more Democratic-friendly seats later this week. The map would still need to be approved by that state's voters in November.",
      "Normally, states redraw maps once a decade with new census figures. But Trump is lobbying other conservative-controlled states like Indiana and Missouri to also try to squeeze new GOP-friendly seats out of their maps as his party prepares for a difficult midterm election next year.",
      "In Texas, Democrats spent the day before the vote continuing to draw attention to the extraordinary lengths the Republicans who run the legislature were going to ensure it takes place. Democratic state Rep. Nicole Collier started it when she refused to sign what Democrats called the \u201cpermission slip\u201d needed to leave the House chamber, a half-page form allowing Department of Public Safety troopers to follow them. She spent Monday night and Tuesday on the House floor, where she set up a livestream while her Democratic colleagues outside had plainclothes officers following them to their offices and homes.",
      "Dallas-area Rep. Linda Garcia said she drove three hours home from Austin with an officer following her. When she went grocery shopping, he went down every aisle with her, pretending to shop, she said. As she spoke to The Associated Press by phone, two unmarked cars with officers inside were parked outside her home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weird feeling,\u201d she said. \u201cThe only way to explain the entire process is: It\u2019s like I\u2019m in a movie.\u201d",
      "The trooper assignments, ordered by Republican House Speaker Dustin Burrows, was another escalation of a redistricting battle that has widened across the country. Trump is pushing GOP state officials to tilt the map for the 2026 midterms more in his favor to preserve the GOP\u2019s slim House majority, and Democrats nationally have rallied around efforts to retaliate.",
      "House Minority Leader Gene Wu, from Houston, and state Rep. Vince Perez, of El Paso, stayed overnight with Collier, who represents a minority-majority district in Fort Worth.",
      "On Tuesday, more Democrats returned to the Capitol to tear up the slips they had signed and stay on the House floor, which has a lounge and restrooms for members.",

      "Collier said having officers shadow her was an attack on her dignity and an attempt to control her movements.",
      "Burrows brushed off Collier's protest, saying he was focused on important issues, such as providing property tax relief and responding to last month\u2019s deadly floods. His statement Tuesday morning did not mention redistricting, and his office did not immediately respond to other Democrats joining Collier.",

      "An attorney who helped design the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have undermined the fairness of a settlement program for abuse victims at the state\u2019s youth detention center",
      "CONCORD, N.H. -- An attorney who helped design and implement the 9/11 victims\u2019 compensation fund says New Hampshire lawmakers have eroded the fairness of a settlement program for those who were abused at the state\u2019s youth detention center.",
      "Deborah Greenspan, who served as deputy special master of the fund created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, recently submitted an affidavit in a class-action lawsuit seeking to block changes to New Hampshire\u2019s out-of-court settlement fund for abuse victims. She's among those expected to testify Wednesday at a hearing on the state's request to dismiss the case and other matters.",
      "More than 1,300 people have sued the state since 2020 alleging that they were physically or sexually abused as children while in state custody, mostly at the Sununu Youth Services Center in Manchester. Most of them put their lawsuits on hold after lawmakers created a settlement fund in 2022 that was pitched as a \u201cvictim-centered\u201d and \u201ctrauma-informed\u201d alternative to litigation run by a neutral administrator appointed by the state Supreme Court. But the Republican-led Legislature changed that process through last-minute additions to the state budget Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed in June.",
      "The amended law gives the governor authority to hire and fire the fund's administrator and gives the attorney general \u2014 also a political appointee \u2014 veto power over settlement awards. That stands in stark contrast to other victim compensation funds, said Greenspan, who currently serves as a court-appointed special master for lawsuits related to lead-tainted water in Flint, Michigan.",
      "She said it \u201cstrains credulity\u201d to believe that anyone would file a claim knowing that \u201cthe persons ultimately deciding the claim were those responsible for the claimant\u2019s injuries.\u201d",
      "\u201cSuch a construct would go beyond the appearance of impropriety and create a clear conflict of interest, undermining the fairness and legitimacy of the settlement process,\" she wrote.",
      "Ayotte and Attorney General John Formella responded by asking a judge to bar Greenspan's testimony, saying she offered \u201cpolicy preferences masquerading as expert opinions\u201d without explaining the principles beyond her conclusions.",
      "\u201cHer affidavit is instead a series of non sequiturs that move from her experience to her conclusions without any of the necessary connective tissue,\u201d they wrote.",
      "The defendants argue that the law still requires the administrator to be \u201can independent, neutral attorney\u201d and point out that the same appointment process is used for the state's judges. They said giving the attorney general the authority to accept or reject settlements is necessary to give the public a voice and ensure that the responsibility for spending millions of dollars in public funds rests with the executive branch.",
      "As of June 30, nearly 2,000 people had filed claims with the settlement fund, which caps payouts at $2.5 million. A total of 386 had been settled, with an average award of $545,000.",
      "One of the claimants says he was awarded $1.5 million award in late July, but the state hasn't finalized it yet, leaving him worried that Formella will veto it.",

      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",

      "\u201cMy child having her phone is very important to me, because if something were to happen, I know instantly,\u201d Johnson said.",
      "Many parents echo this \u2014 generally supporting restrictions but wanting a say in the policymaking and better communication, particularly about safety \u2014 and they have a real need to coordinate schedules with their children and to know about any problems their children may encounter, said Jason Allen, the national director of partnerships for the National Parents Union.",

The rest of the grand jury presentation consisted of a PowerPoint slideshow shown during the June 18 session and a call log shown during the July 2 session, which ended with grand jurors voting to indict Epstein.

      "The reorganization is part of a broader administration effort to rethink its evaluation of foreign threats to American elections, a topic that has become politically loaded given President Donald Trump's long-running resistance to the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Russia interfered on his behalf in the 2016 election.",
      "In February, for instance, Attorney General Pam Bondi disbanded an FBI task force focused on investigating foreign influence operations, including those that target U.S. elections.

      "She\u2019s released a series of documents meant to call into question the legitimacy of the intelligence community\u2019s findings on Russian election interference in 2016, and this week, at Trump\u2019s direction, revoked the security clearances of 37 current and former government officials.",

Those cars passed the homes of at least 2.5 million people living within a mile of the tracks, along with more than 1,000 schools and 80 hospitals, the analysis found.",

Yet those teams might be hours away, leaving firefighters to handle the unfolding crisis on their own.",

      "The Howard Center analysis of federal data found 57 derailments in the last decade that resulted in the release of at least 1,000 gallons (3,800 liters) of hazardous material. Twenty-six of those derailments resulted in evacuations; 16 caused fires or an explosion.",
      "When such derailments occur, firefighters called to the scene often face a critical problem: Many don\u2019t know what chemicals are on board the train and what the exposure risks might be. And federal regulators have delayed the requirement to immediately supply that information.",
      "In a letter to federal regulators this month, East Palestine Fire Chief Keith Drabick criticized the delay and urged regulators to enforce a stricter timeline on railroads.",
      "\u201cThe 2023 East Palestine derailment in my village highlighted a critical lack of timely communication with public safety about hazardous materials information involved in rail emergencies,\u201d Drabick wrote.

      "In 2019, a Canadian National train derailed inside that tunnel, spilling over 12,000 gallons (45,400 liters) of sulfuric acid.

      "Actor Celia Rose Gooding has stepped into the center of one of science fiction's most passionate fandoms, portraying the iconic character Nyota Uhura in Paramount+'s \"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds.\"",
      "\"Trekkies are some of the most devoted fans I think in fandom history,\" Gooding said. \"To be embraced with open arms, reprising an iconic character, they've been so generous and so kind to me and so receptive of my take of her.\"",
      "The series, the 11th in the Star Trek franchise, takes place a decade before the original show. Gooding plays a young Uhura, a Starfleet cadet specializing in linguistics. Though she comes from a family of Trekkies herself, she admitted she was not very familiar with the franchise before landing the role.",
      "\"When they found out that I'd booked the role, I think everyone was ten times more excited than I was,\" Gooding said.",
      "She describes her mom as the biggest Trek fan she knows and said she leaned in her mother's early guidance, from perfecting the Vulcan salute to embracing the show's spirit.",
      "\"'Trek' is all about curiosity and hope and community,\" Gooding said.",
      "Gooding explained that she intentionally avoided learning too much about Uhura's future storylines, since the prequel format means her character doesn't know what's ahead.",
      "\"She doesn't know her future, so it's probably best to not be too, too informed,\" Gooding said. \"So I'm not playing as if I know what's going to happen to me, because no one knows what tomorrow brings.\"",
      "This week's episode marks a turning point for Uhura, as she faces scrutiny as she navigates her dual identity as both a young woman in her early twenties and a Starfleet officer entrusted with a lot of responsibility.",
      "\"When that responsibility is interrogated, when her contributions to Starfleet are interrogated in a way that she's not expecting, she has to confront her contributions to the institution that is Starfleet in a way that I don't think Star Trek has given audiences a lens into before,\" Gooding said.",
      "The season also introduces lighter moments, including a budding romance.",
      "\"I just was really excited for her to have some levity and some joy and some flirtation,\" Gooding said. \"A little quasi workplace romance can't hurt anybody in the fictional world. It's just fun to play a recognizable, playful version of this character.\"",
      "Season three of \"Star Trek: Strange New Worlds\" is now streaming on Paramount+.",
      "Analisa Novak is a content producer for CBS News and the Emmy Award-winning \"CBS Mornings.\" She specializes in covering live events and exclusive interviews for the show.

      "The FTC alleges that, in a one year period, the group purchased at least 379,776 tickets from Ticketmaster at a cost of nearly $57 million. The company then allegedly resold those tickets on secondary marketplaces for about $64 million.",
      "In a statement, Key Investment Group said it will \"vigorously defend itself against this clear example of regulatory overreach.\" It claims the FTC \"misleadingly characterizes KIG's use of standard internet browsers,\" and said the government's case \"threatens to dismantle the secondary ticket market for live events.\"",

      "The company is also accused of using thousands of credit card numbers, including virtual card numbers, spoofing IP addresses to hide the identity of the ticket purchaser, and using SIM technology to collect the incoming verification codes.",
      "In doing so, the FTC said the brokers violated the FTC Act and the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, which prohibits people from \"circumventing a security measure, access control system, or other technological control or measure on an internet website or online service that is used by the ticket issuer to enforce posted event ticket limits or to maintain the integrity of posted online ticket purchasing order rules.\"",

    "story": [
      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder. He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the\u00a0two people\u00a0who did. He rejected the state's offer to settle with a guilty plea last month,\u00a0CBS affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "story": [
      "Laufey's music may not be what you usually think of as \"pop,\" but if pop is short for popular, then she is indeed a pop star. The 26-year-old Icelander has earned a devoted following blending modern lyrics and music with classical and jazz. \"My music is such a combination of the sounds of my childhood,\" she said. \"It's just something that's become a part of me. I wanted to make things that made me happy.",
      "\"I loved Golden Age musicals,\" said Laufey. \"I'd watch 'Carousel' and 'Oklahoma' and 'American in Paris' and 'Sound of Music.' They were so beautiful and had these dance breaks and the dresses were floating and the colors \u2013 that feeling I got from that, I just wanted to create that feeling.\"",
      "The world she inhabits (in her work, anyway) is whimsical and romantic, full of windswept cliffs, frilly dresses and bows \u2026 and cello, almost always cello.",
      "Watch Laufey perform \"I Wish You Love\" with the Iceland Symphony Orchestra:",
      "She says the cello is \"as important to me as my voice. And I think it's really what makes a Laufey song a Laufey song.\"",
      "Laufey L\u00edn Bing J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir comes by it naturally. Her Icelandic father introduced her to jazz when she was a girl; her Chinese mother played classical violin. So does Laufey's identical twin sister.",
      "Growing up, she said, she felt different: \"Everyone was like, you know, going to play soccer after school or dance, and I was sitting down and playing music from the 17th century. And then on top that I was a twin, identical twin. I just feel, like, weird on top of weird, on top of weird.\"",
      "And things only got weirder when she started singing, as when she appeared on the TV competition \"Iceland's Got Talent\" singing Alicia Keys' \"If I Ain't Got You,\" at age 13: \"I remember going on singing competitions in Iceland when I was younger and they'd always be like, 'She sounds like a 40-year-old woman that's been divorced twice and she chain-smokes cigarettes,'' Laufey said. \"And I was, like, a 13-year-old girl standing on stage being like, okay, like, I just wanted to be a girl. So, yeah I was always a little bit like \u2026 felt a little bit like a circus act.\"",
      "But Laufey found her footing at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. She started posting original songs and jazz covers on social media during the pandemic, and they quickly went viral.",
      "Laufey performs \"I Love You (For Sentimental Reasons\") on guitar and cello:",
      "I asked, \"Were you surprised that people were responding to the jazz influences?\"",
      "\"I was so shocked, because I'd never seen any example of it before,\" Laufey replied. \"And I'd never seen a community of young people \u2026 that was the most shocking part, that it was young people responding to the music. But there was always a part of me that was like, of course, it's the best music in the world!\"",
      "Now she sells out just about every concert \u2013 like a recent one in Norfolk, Virginia, where one fan, Alissa, told us, \"When I first like showed, like, my parents that, they were like, 'This is what you guys listen to?' And I was like, 'Yeah, like, this is what, like, younger people are listening to!'\"",
      "Another fan, Logan, said, \"I feel like she takes just kind of more 'old people music' and pushes it into, like, a newer generation so that more people can enjoy it.\"",
      "Laufey's new album, \"A Matter of Time,\" comes out this week. A stadium tour will follow.",
      "Her songwriting usually starts on guitar, like her bossa nova-influenced \"From the Start.\"",
      "But she just as easily can weave in a little classical, as she did on her last album, \"Bewitched.\" Last year, \"Bewitched\" briefly knocked Frank Sinatra off the top of the jazz charts \u2013 and then, that album won a best traditional pop vocal Grammy Award, beating such artists as Bruce Springsteen.",
      "And then, Barbra Streisand asked Laufey to sing on her recent album of duets, performing a song Laufey wrote, \"Letter to My 13-Year-Old Self.\" \"It's one of those songs that I wrote just in my most intimate moments and could have been a song that I never put out,\" she said. \"It was a song for me to heal myself. But it's a very hopeful song. It's reaching back to tell your younger self that you're going to be okay.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/severance-star-adam-scott/",
    "published": "Sun, 17 Aug 2025 10:45:48 -0400",
    "summary": "The former \"Parks and Recreation\" star heads the surreal, critically-acclaimed series about workers at a mysterious corporation whose brains are altered to create distinctly separate personalities in and out of the office.",
    "story": [
      "Adam Scott was once a solid \"that guy\" \u2013 a steadily working actor you might recognize from any number of roles. He's been active since the early nineties, playing everything from Howard Hughes' press agent in \"The Aviator,\" to a pompous jerk in \"Step Brothers.\" He's acted in large ensemble television shows like \"Party Down\" and \"Parks and Recreation.\" But in 2022, when ads started popping up for a new Apple TV+ show called \"Severance,\" with his face front and center, it was a new experience for Scott.",
      "\"It was terrifying, like, truly,\" he said. \"As an actor, it's something you wait your entire career for, your entire life for. But when it happened, I was immediately terrified, and didn't quite know why. I guess I was afraid that it was just gonna end up being embarrassing, and people were gonna make fun of us, and make fun of me.\"",
      "Quite the opposite. \"Severance\" ended up becoming a critically acclaimed hit. The show's second season is nominated for more Emmys than any other show this year (27 in all), including outstanding drama series, and a lead actor nomination for Scott.",
      "Scott's character, Mark, works for a mysterious, seemingly sinister corporation. When he's off the clock, he has no memory of his work life. He is a \"severed\" employee \u2013 a device in his brain separates his office self from his home self.",
      "In this scene, Mark S. (Adam Scott) meets his non-office self, Mark Scout, through video recordings:",
      "I said, \"A lot of people relate to 'Severance' because of that sentiment of like, 'Wouldn't it be nice to turn your brain off from 9:00 to 5:00 and not do my mind-numbing job?'\u00a0 It sounds like you never really had a job like that, though. How do you tap into that?\"",
      "\"It's funny, because the things that ended up really sort of making a difference in my career were, like, 'Parks and Rec' and 'Party Down' and 'Severance,'\" said Scott. \"They are largely shows that are about work. And these are jobs that I've never actually had to participate in in real life, 'cause I was always in a play or doing a guest spot on 'NYPD Blue' or whatever. I guess I relate to these kind of feelings that these characters have because it's been sort of this long path for me in show business.\"",
      "Scott's path began in his hometown of Santa Cruz, California, where he'd spend hours in his room watching, and imitating, actors he saw on David Letterman.",
      "Did the idea of doing it professionally cross his mind? \"100%,\" said Scott. \"In fact, I used to practice on my bed. I would set it up like a couch. I would practice being on David Letterman. I remember I had a project that I would pretend I was promoting, where Harrison Ford and I were playing father-and-son cops. I'm sure I just looked like an insane person.\"",
      "\"For what it's worth I would watch that today,\" I said.",
      "\"I know, it sounds great!\"",
      "After some success in high school plays, Scott moved to Pasadena to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, where he started thinking that \"Adam Scott\" didn't sound dramatic enough: \"When I was in theater school, I really fancied myself as a very serious actor in the vein of Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. In fact, at one point I wanted to change my last name to Quardero. I remember writing on a piece of paper, 'Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Adam Quardero.' My mother's maiden name was Quartararo.\"",
      "Scott stuck with his last name and, after graduation, stuck it out through the high and lows of building an acting career. \"One thing I always felt that I knew about myself is that I was never going to leave,\" he said. \"I didn't have any other options. But I knew that I was just gonna stick around until something happened, something came together for me.\"",
      "Scott's five seasons on the NBC sitcom \"Parks and Recreation\" took his career to the next level, although it came with an unexpected downside: now that he was so well known for comedy, it was harder to get dramatic roles.",
      "Ben Stiller, one of the executive producers and the primary director of \"Severance,\" said of Scott, \"He'd done, you know, work that was dramatic before, it just wasn't things that, you know, people really hadn't seen as much of it as his comedy work.",
      "He believed Scott had the skills necessary to play what's essentially two roles \u2013 or at least, two parts of the same person \u2013 sometimes transitioning between his severed personalities in a single shot. \"The key to the effect working really is Adam's change of expression, and just how good he is as an actor technically,\" Stiller said. \"He has to get that timing right of the change with the camera effect, so it's not easy to do. He can take a note just, you know, adjust something, you know, minimally, that very few actors I work with can do as well as him.\"",
      "I asked Stiller, \"It seems like you saw that potential early on. Was it a tough sell for the studio to have him front the show?\"",
      "\"You know, they had a different idea in the beginning, but I said, 'Look, Adam, to me, I think he's the guy,\" Stiller replied.",
      "It's clear fans agree. As part of Apple's massive marketing push for \"Severance,\" viewers were invited to an event at the historic former Bell Labs building in Holmdel, New Jersey, which stands in for the headquarters of the show's fictional Lumon Industries.",
      "Scott said, \"Seeing the photos of this place, of the Bell Labs building, it started dawning on me just the scale of the show and what it was exactly that Ben had in mind.\"",
      "Outside of \"Severance,\" Scott's work life and home life revolve around his wife, Naomi. They produce podcasts, films, and TV shows together. They met in the late '90s, which means she's seen him through a number of career ups and downs. \"I kind of learned that there was a cycle of him, you know, picking himself up off the ground, and I did know how to nurture and encourage that,\" Naomi said. \"That, I knew how to do. But it was hard to watch.\"",
      "I asked, \"What's it been like to see people finally see what you've been seeing for all these years?\"",
      "\"Oh, it's very vindicating!\" she laughed. \"I knew it. It's great. I love it.\"",
      "Adam Scott had to audition for \"Severance,\" and fight for the role. Now, with season three already in the works, the actor who always knew he was in it for the long haul is finally getting his due. Though he recognizes that there is no \"Bank of Hollywood\" that is allowing him to cash in after making 30 years of deposits.\u00a0 \"No \u2013 you're entitled to nothing in show business, and I knew that,\" he said. \"But I also knew that there was something I could bring to it that nobody else could. And I knew that I would have to give all of myself to it in order to pull it off. I would have to use absolutely everything I've learned over 30 years if I was gonna do it right. And so, when I was lucky enough to get the job, that's exactly what I did.\"",

      "On Wednesday after Swift went on the \"New Heights\" podcast co-hosted by her boyfriend, NFL football star Travis Kelce, to announce the imminent release of her 12th studio album \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" major companies went into marketing overdrive.",
      "Numerous corporations, from United Airlines to Olive Garden, began posting orange-hued memes on their own social media accounts soon after the new album was announced. Shake Shack, FedEx, Buffalo Wild Wings, Cinnabon, Walmart and Netflix did, too.",
      "That's because Swift appeared onstage wearing orange numerous times toward the end of her Eras Tour, and discussed her feelings about the color on the Wednesday podcast.",

      "Swift's tour appearances have become economic events. The singer's Eras Tour two years ago was the first such tour to cross the billion-dollar mark, according to Pollstar's 2023 year-end charts. Cities and their surrounding areas registered a sizeable economic boost after Swift appeared, with thousands of fans making the pilgrimage and spending money at hotels, restaurants and elsewhere.",
      "Swift also mentioned during the Wednesday podcast that she had Lasik eye surgery. In response, the X account for LASIK.com wasted no time promoting the fortuitous namedrop. The post had more than 450,000 views and 17,000 likes as of Friday.",
      "About 500,000 Americans undergo Lasik every year, CBS News recently reported. And while the American Refractive Surgery Council says the complication rate is less than 1%, side effects are not uncommon and should not be taken lightly by those considering the procedure.",

      "By Thursday afternoon, Wednesday night's talk had already been seen more than 11.7 million times on YouTube. Clips distributed on Instagram, TikTok, X and elsewhere have received more than 400 million views, and the episode was also available for streaming on audio platforms.",

The most-watched podcast episode ever on YouTube, and likely the most-consumed podcast ever, is by a company called Thmanyah, a Saudi Arabian Arabic podcast network and independent journalism platform, according to its website. The video has racked up 144 million views in two years.",
      "Swift, who infrequently gives interviews to journalists, revealed key information about her upcoming album, \"The Life of a Showgirl,\" and talked about her relationships with Travis Kelce and her family, and her joy of gaining full control of her past work \u2014 a yearslong quest.",

      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years. At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a00.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",

    "summary": "President Trump called on Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his appointees accused her of mortgage fraud.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:06:55 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often trying to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year could would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "The loan program, which was launched in 2007 under President George W. Bush, is aimed at helping public employees such as teachers and police officers shed student loan debt.",
      "The proposed rule lists some examples of what sorts of activities would be considered illegal, potentially resulting in an organization's workers being excluded from the public service loan program.

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 13:24:29 -0400",
    "summary": "S&amp;P said it is maintaining the AA+ rating on the U.S. as it expects tariff revenue will shore up the nation's finances.",
    "story": [
      "S&P Global Ratings reaffirmed its AA+ credit rating for the U.S., saying that new revenue raised by the Trump administration's tariffs will help offset the tax cuts authorized by the Republicans' \u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act.",
      "The credit ratings agency, which issued its new assessment of the nation's fiscal health late Monday, said that it is holding its AA+/A-1+ rating steady, with a stable outlook.",
      "The fresh analysis comes after Moody's Ratings, another large credit ratings agency, downgraded the U.S. in May, highlighting investor concerns about the nation's growing debt and policy uncertainty sparked by President Trump's trade policies. While S&P highlighted a range of economic concerns in its report, including the impact of new tax cuts against a backdrop of already high U.S. debt and deficits, the agency also underscored the resiliency of the nation's economy as well as the new tariff revenue generated by the Trump administration.",
      "\"Amid the rise in effective tariff rates, we expect meaningful tariff revenue to generally offset weaker fiscal outcomes that might otherwise be associated with the recent fiscal legislation, which contains both cuts and increases in tax and spending,\" S&P analysts wrote in the ratings note.",
      "The report added, \"The ratings on the U.S. are based on its wealthy, diversified and resilient economy, with per capita GDP over $89,000 in 2025. Since the pandemic, U.S. growth has far surpassed that of its peers.\"",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The fresh ratings assessment comes as the U.S. economy is showing signs of a slowdown, with GDP decelerating to an average rate of 1.25% during the first half of the year, compared with 2.8% in 2024. The job market also faltered in July, with employers adding a disappointing 73,000 jobs last month,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Labor Department \u2014 far fewer than economists had forecast.",
      "The weak jobs data suggests that businesses are delaying hiring amid the uncertainty created by the Trump administration's new tariff regime, which has been exacerbated by numerous postponements and rate changes.",
      "Amid those headwinds, the revenue generated from tariffs is surging: The U.S. government collected about $30 billion from import duties\u00a0in July, according to the Treasury Department. That amounts to a 242% jump in tariff revenue since July 2024.",
      "While that new revenue will help bolster the nation's finances, it comes at a cost to American consumers and businesses, economists say. Tariffs are paid by U.S. importers \u2014 from\u00a0small businesses to large retailers and manufacturers \u2014 when they accept goods from foreign countries at U.S. ports. Typically, those businesses then raise their prices to cover the costs of these duties, according to economists.",
      "Because of that dynamic, tariffs are viewed as a tax on consumers by economists, with the Tax Policy Center, a tax-focused think tank,\u00a0estimating that the new import duties will cost the average taxpayer about $2,700 in additional costs in 2026.",

      "Fewer young adults are achieving economic and family milestones typically associated with adulthood, according to a recent working\u00a0paper\u00a0from the U.S. Census Bureau.",
      "The paper looked at nationally representative data from 2005 and 2023 to examine changes in young adults' experiences reaching major life events, such as moving out of their parents' house, getting married, and having a child. Researchers found a dramatic shift in the attainment of these milestones in recent decades.",
      "The reason for this, according to the paper, is that more young adults between the ages of 25 and 34 are facing economic barriers compared with previous generations. Changing societal attitudes around family formation are also contributing to the sharp decline in the share of young people reaching what the U.S. Census Bureau considers to be \"key milestones.\"",
      "According to the working paper, \"Changes in Milestones of Adulthood,\" almost half of all young adults in 1975 had reached four milestones associated with adulthood: moving out of one's parents' home, getting a job, getting married and having a child.",
      "Five decades on, that progression has changed dramatically. The share of young adults that have followed the traditional pathway to adulthood has dropped to less than a quarter, according to the paper.",
      "\"...Living arrangements, economic opportunities and attitudes toward family formation have not been experienced in the same fashion across generations of young adults,\" the working paper reads. \"Increases in job turbulence and economic downturns, for example, have resulted in some young adults navigating more volatile and uncertain economic environments.\"",
      "Economic conditions, combined with changing cultural norms, \"have implications for how young people develop their identity as adults,\" the paper states.",
      "This redefinition of young adulthood comes as the cost of everyday essentials, including housing, food, gas and daycare rises. As a result, more Americans are choosing to forego having a family, in some cases because they deem such choices unaffordable, the study finds.",
      "Researchers measured changes in the achievement of individual milestones, too. While one-quarter of young adults achieved all four milestones, 28% met two economic milestones \u2014 moving out of their parents' homes and finding jobs.",
      "Women in the workforce",
      "In the 1970s, getting married, having a child, and living independently, were the second-most common group of milestones young people achieved, next to the completion of all four.",
      "Women's gains in the workforce, along with changing cultural attitudes, however, have led this combination of milestones to become less popular, the report notes.",
      "The completion of education, another marker of adulthood, has overshadowed other milestones over the years as an increasing number of young adults enroll in college, according to the paper.",
      "\"These higher levels of educational attainment result in contemporary cohorts spending a longer portion of their young adult lives enrolled in higher education, potentially delaying other markers of adulthood such as entering the labor force or marriage,\" the working paper states.",
      "When it comes to perceptions of adulthood, having a job takes precedence over marriage, as young adults see economic achievements as more directly tied to adulthood than they do committing to a spouse.",
      "\"Marriage is increasingly viewed as a capstone of adulthood, something to pursue after achieving economic stability through completing formal education, establishing an independent household and becoming employed,\" the working paper states.",

      "Air Canada Chief Executive Michael Rousseau said restarting a major carrier is a complex undertaking and said regular service may require seven to 10 days. Some flights will be canceled until the schedule is stabilized.",
      "\"Full restoration may require a week or more, so we ask for our customers' patience and understanding over the coming days,\" Rousseau said in a statement.",
      "The two sides reached the deal with the help of a mediator early Tuesday morning. The airline said mediation discussions \"were begun on the basis that the union commit to have the airline's 10,000 flight attendants immediately return to work.\" Air Canada declined to comment further on the agreement until the ratification process is complete. It noted a strike or lockout is not possible during this time.",
      "The union said it is \"required to advise our membership that we must fully cooperate with resumption of operations,\" adding that the talks that settled the strike began at 7 p.m. Monday lasted until 4:23 a.m. Tuesday.",
      "Earlier, Air Canada said rolling cancellations would extend through Tuesday afternoon after the union defied a second return-to-work order.",
      "The Canada Industrial Relations Board had declared the strike illegal Monday and ordered the flight attendants back on the job. But the union said it would defy the directive. Union leaders also ignored a weekend order to submit to binding arbitration and end the strike by Sunday afternoon.",
      "The board is an independent administrative tribunal that interprets and applies Canada's labor laws. The government ordered the board to intervene.",
      "Labor leaders objected to the Canadian government's repeated use of a law that cuts off workers' right to strike and forces them into arbitration, a step the government took in recent years with workers at ports, railways and elsewhere.",
      "\"Your right to vote on your wages was preserved,\" the union said in a post on its website.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day. The airline estimated Monday that 500,000 customers would be affected by flight cancellations.",
      "Aviation analytics firm Cirium said that as of Monday afternoon, Air Canada had called off at least 1,219 domestic flights and 1,339 international flights since last Thursday, when the carrier began gradually suspending its operations ahead of the strike and lockout that began early Saturday.",
      "Toronto's Pearson International Airport, Canada's largest, said it will deploy additional staff to assist passengers and support startup operations.",

    "story": [
      "As students savor the last dregs of summer before heading back to school, many families are shopping for supplies earlier this year to get ahead of tariffs.",
      "Over half of U.S. households that earn less than $50,000 a year say they plan to buy only essential school items, while 74% say they are shopping earlier than usual to avoid a potential hit from tariffs,\u00a0according\u00a0to the National Retail Federation (NRF), a trade organization that opposes higher import duties.",
      "Many back-to-school essentials, from clothing and footwear to personal electronics, are imported. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce\u00a0estimates that the U.S. tariff rate on such goods has jumped to an average of 18% this year, more than triple the 5% rate in 2024.",
      "Families with children in kindergarten through 12th grade are projected to spend an average of $858 on clothing, shoes, school supplies and electronics this year, NRF found. That's down slightly from $875 in 2024, as inflation has continued to ease this year, although up sharply from $697 in 2019, the group's data shows.",
      "Record high prices",
      "Recent data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis\u00a0shows\u00a0that the cost of school supplies and books is at a record high. A recent analysis from The Century Foundation also found that prices for a typical assortment of school supplies are up more than 7% in price this year, with goods such index cards and binders subject to even steeper price hikes.",
      "School supplies cut across a range of goods categories, from dorm room d\u00e9cor, clothing and personal electronics to staples including writing implements, notebooks and backpacks.",
      "\"Consumers are being mindful of the potential impacts of tariffs and inflation on back-to-school items, and have turned to early shopping, discount stores and summer sales for savings on school essentials,\" Katherine Cullen, NRF vice president of industry and consumer insights, said in a statement.",
      "Although steep new U.S. tariffs haven't delivered the kind of shock to the economy that some forecasters expected, many consumers are worried, shopping expert Trae Bodge told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "\"All of the studies that I'm seeing are showing that consumers are concerned,\" Bodge said. \"We are seeing prices ticking up because of tariffs, because of inflation. And so people are worried about being able to afford the things they need for school.\"",
      "The Consumer Price Index \u2014 a closely watched inflation gauge \u2014 rose 2.7% in July on an annual basis, slightly cooler than economists had forecast.",
      "How to save",
      "Large retailers are rolling out deep discounts on some school supplies, with items like notebooks, folders, crayons and erasers selling for less than $1.",
      "For big-ticket items, experts urge consumers to compare prices. That includes cross-checking in-store prices against online deals. For example, a $269 Samsung Galaxy tablet at one retailer was available for $220 on its app. Most retailers also will match the best price on their own websites, Bodge noted.",
      "When it comes to personal electronics, many of which are imported and now subject to President Trump's wide-reaching tariffs, Bodge urges consumers to consider buying refurbished models.",
      "\"A lot of retailers offer refurbished items that also come with a warranty, and that's a really good option if you're looking to save,\" she said.",
      "When it comes to products like pencils and notebooks, buying a store-brand over a name-brand also often offers savings. For clothes, experts advise waiting until school starts \u2014 when kids ask for whatever is trendy, you'll have a little money left over.",
      "Another way to both manage your budget while imparting a lesson on spending is to give teens a gift card, Bodge said. \"So they will be much more careful spending their money versus your money. And they'll stay on budget by doing this,\" she told CBS News.",

      "When is Labor Day?",
      "This year, Labor Day falls on Monday, Sept.1.",
      "What is the history of Labor Day?",
      "Nowadays, Labor Day is more commonly associated with barbecues and beach days, but the federal holiday was created to celebrate the hard-won rights of American workers.",
      "Before early labor laws came into play in the 20th century, the average U.S. worker's schedule spanned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, with low wages and little protections, according to\u00a0History.com.",
      "The culmination of years of strikes and protests by American workers to secure better job conditions, Labor Day was signed into law on June 28, 1894, by President Grover Cleveland.",
      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",

    "story": [
      "Wages still haven't caught up with inflation, four years after the pandemic caused prices to soar and created a cost-of-living crisis for many households, a new study finds.",
      "Americans on average are earning 1.2 percentage points below the rise in the cost of living over the past four years, which means that the typical worker's pay increases over that time haven't yet caught up to higher prices, according to Bankrate's 2025 Wage to Inflation Index.",
      "The findings come as Americans remain sour about the economy, with 55% rating it as either very or fairly bad, according to a July poll from CBS News. Three-quarters said their incomes haven't kept up with inflation, while a majority also said they've seen prices creep higher in recent weeks and also expect that to continue.",
      "But some professions are falling further behind than others, with educators seeing the biggest gap between income growth and inflation during the past four years, the study found. Teachers have long struggled with a \"wage gap,\" meaning that they typically earn less than college graduates working in other fields, due to issues such as constraints on school funding,\u00a0according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.",
      "\"Wage growth is often a reflection of who has the power in the labor market,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster told CBS MoneyWatch. \"If there are more job openings than workers to fill them, businesses will often lift pay to retain or attract talent.\"",
      "She added, \"On the flip side, if there are too few job openings, companies don't have to work as hard to keep workers because they have nowhere to really go.\"",
      "Overall, the 1.2 percentage point gap between the typical workers' pay growth and inflation during the past four years signals that many households are continuing to feel financial strain, Foster added. Even before the pandemic, millions of Americans were\u00a0struggling to save for emergencies.",
      "\"Wages not keeping up with inflation translate to outright purchasing-power destruction,\" Foster said. \"These are funds that households could be using to stash away for their goals, like saving for retirement and a home, or building up their safety nets and emergency fund.\"",
      "The professions that have outpaced inflation include those that saw a spike in demand after the pandemic, including leisure and hospitality workers, she added. \"Health care, meanwhile, is driving job growth lately, accounting for 88% of private-sector payroll growth last month,\" Foster said.",
      "Wage dissatisfaction",
      "Only about 54% of Americans say they are satisfied with their current wages, according to a new analysis from Federal Reserve Bank of New York. That represents the lowest satisfaction level since the NY Fed began tracking the measure in 2014.",
      "Even high-income households, which contribute about\u00a0half of all consumer spending\u00a0and drive economic growth, are facing bigger financial hurdles, including surging delinquencies on credit cards and auto loans, according to recent research.",
      "For instance, the share of all new jobs that pay above-average wages has fallen to 7% this year, down from 38% prior to 2020, according to credit-scoring company VantageScore. That can make it tougher for professionals to find new jobs if they suffer a job loss, the group noted.",
      "Workers in white-collar industries like finance and business services \"speak of a frozen job market,\" Foster noted. \"Employed workers in the sector can't find anywhere else to go and unemployed workers struggle to find new work.\"",

Air Canada then said it planned to resume flights Sunday evening. But when the workers refused, the airline said it would resume flights Monday evening instead. However, there was no sign that the Canadian Union of Public Employees, or CUPE, would relent.",
      "Air Canada operates around 700 flights per day.",

      "Union leader Hancock on Sunday had ripped up a copy of the initial back-to-work order outside Toronto's Pearson International Airport, and said members wouldn't go back to work this week, to the cheers of picketing flight attendants.",
      "Flight attendants walked off the job around 1 a.m. Eastern Time on Saturday after turning down the airline's request to enter into government-directed arbitration, which allows a third-party mediator to decide the terms of a new contract.",
      "Air Canada and CUPE have been in contract talks for about eight months, but remain far apart on the issue of pay and the unpaid work that flight attendants do when planes aren't in the air.",
      "The airline's latest offer included a 38% increase in total compensation, including benefits and pensions, over four years. That deal \"would have made our flight attendants the best compensated in Canada,\" according to the carrier.",
      "But the union pushed back, saying the proposed 8% raise in the first year didn't go far enough because of inflation.",

      "Stark took his concept a step further and began designing homes for Phoenix's unhoused people out of the steel containers. The project was developed for the City of Phoenix with sustainable living company Steel + Spark, and the housing units are called \"X-WING\" shelters as an ode to the unit's \"X\" design.",
      "Each \"X-WING\" is made up of four containers, topped with solar panels and joined together in an \"X\" shape that also creates courtyards for its residents when placed beside another unit.

    "summary": "The U.S. has expanded its campaign to persuade countries to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Uganda's government confirmed the deportation agreement with the U.S., saying the two countries are working on implementation details. The country's foreign ministry said Uganda \"prefers\" to receive migrants from other parts of Africa.",
      "\"The Agreement is in respect of Third Country Nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin,\" Uganda's foreign ministry said in a statement. \"This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

      "The United States is deploying three Aegis guided-missile destroyers to the waters off Venezuela as part of President Trump's effort to combat threats from Latin American drug cartels, a White House official confirmed to CBS News on Wednesday, confirming a report by the Reuters news agency.",
      "The USS Gravely, the USS Jason Dunham and the USS Sampson were to depart for the region over the next few days, the official said.",
      "A Defense Department official confirmed to The Associated Press that the military assets had been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed \"over the course of several months.\"",
      "The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Mr. Trump pushes for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities, and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
      "The press office of Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment from the AP on the deployment of the U.S. destroyers. But without mentioning the ships, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Tuesday, dismissed the Trump administration's drug-trafficking accusations against Venezuela.",
      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",
      "On Monday, Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced the planned deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.",
      "\"The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,\" Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.",
      "Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. The U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest at the time.",

    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a00.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

    "summary": "President Trump called on Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his appointees accused her of mortgage fraud.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material in the case of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying prosecutors had failed to demonstrate that \"special circumstances\" warranted the disclosure.",
      "Judge Richard Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued his ruling in a 14-page decision denying the government's motion to unseal the documents.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material in question includes the testimony of just a single witness, an FBI agent \"who had no direct knowledge of the facts of the case and whose testimony was mostly hearsay.\" The documents the government was seeking to unseal included roughly 70 pages of transcripts of the agent's two presentations to the grand jury, a PowerPoint exhibit and a call log.",
      "Berman noted that the Justice Department's files on Epstein dwarf those stemming from the grand jury. Proceedings before grand juries are typically kept secret.",
      "\"A significant and compelling reason to reject the Government's position in this litigation is that the Government has already undertaken a comprehensive investigation into the Epstein case and, not surprisingly, has assembled a 'trove' of Epstein documents, interviews, and exhibits. And, the Government committed that it would share its Epstein investigation materials with the public,\" Berman wrote.",
      "\"The Government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein Files. By comparison, the instant grand jury motion appears to be a 'diversion' from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession,\" Berman wrote, quoting a decision by another judge in New York who\u00a0denied the government's move to unseal material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.",
      "\"The information contained in the Epstein grand jury transcripts pales in comparison to the Epstein investigation information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice,\" he concluded.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material is \"merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.\" He cited \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\" as one of the factors that weighed in favor of not releasing the documents.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Berman's ruling.",
      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most well-known accusers, who died by suicide earlier this year, said in a statement, \"We applaud Judge Richard Berman's decision not to release the grand jury testimony in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. We wholeheartedly agree with his assessment that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is creating a diversion with its actions regarding the grand jury motion, which distracts from the vast scope of the Epstein files in the government's possession.\"",
      "\"We recognize the critical importance of protecting survivors; it is essential that we redact any information that could jeopardize their safety or privacy. Their well-being must always be our priority,\" the family said. \"At the same time, we demand accountability for all individuals implicated in these heinous acts. Those responsible must be held to the fullest extent of the law. We will not accept anything less than justice for Virginia and all survivors.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, a probe that ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges. He was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 and died in a Manhattan jail weeks later. Several investigations determined he died by suicide.",
      "There has been increasing pressure on the Trump administration from Democrats and many Republicans to disclose more information about the Epstein case. The Justice Department issued findings of a review of the Epstein investigation in July, saying it had found no evidence of a \"client list\" or indication that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, an announcement that spurred more questions from skeptics.",
      "Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency since the Justice Department's review. The House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to the department for documents related to Epstein earlier this month. The committee said Tuesday that it expects to receive documents later this week, and intends to begin releasing them pending a review to redact victims' information.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is slashing her office's staff by around 40% \u2014 the latest major Trump-era change slated for the intelligence agency.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, is planning on cutting its headcount to around 1,300 employees, down from approximately 2,000 in February and 1,500 as of mid-August, according to a senior ODNI official.",
      "The cuts at ODNI are expected to save around $700 million annually, Gabbard's office estimated in a\u00a0statement. The total budget for all U.S. intelligence agencies exceeded $100 billion last year.",
      "Gabbard said ODNI \"has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power.\"",
      "In a fact sheet on the changes \u2014 dubbed \"ODNI 2.0\" \u2014 the agency said several departments it argued were redundant would be refocused. Those include the National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center, which monitors for weapons of mass destruction; the Foreign Malign Influence Center, which describes its mission as \"mitigating threats to democracy\"; and the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, which handles cybersecurity.",
      "The agency is also planning on shutting down the National Intelligence University, merging it with the Pentagon's National Defense University. And it will shutter the External Research Council and Strategic Futures Group, which ODNI accused of partisanship.",
      "ODNI was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which investigators say was preceded by a lack of communication between U.S. intelligence agencies. Its duties include overseeing the dozens of agencies that make up the intelligence community and advising the president on intelligence matters. Since ODNI's founding around 20 years ago, some members of both parties have supported changes to the agency.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, hailed Gabbard's restructuring plans. Earlier this year, Cotton introduced a bill that would cap the number of full-time ODNI employees at 650.",
      "\"Congress created the ODNI to be a lean organization that used small staffs to coordinate across the Intelligence Community and execute specific, important tasks. Today's announcement is an important step towards returning ODNI to that original size, scope, and mission,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Gabbard's moves in a statement. He pointed to \"broad, bipartisan agreement that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is in need of thoughtful reform.\"",
      "\"But given Director Gabbard's track record of politicizing intelligence \u2013 including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials \u2013 I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,\" said Warner, in reference to Gabbard's\u00a0announcement Tuesday revoking\u00a0the security clearances for dozens of current and former government officials, accusing them of \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence.\"",
      "Since she was confirmed as ODNI's leader in February, Gabbard has railed against what she views as politicization of intelligence \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic critics. In some cases, she has reignited years-old political battles over Russian interference in the 2016 election, releasing documents that she argues call into question the government's findings that Russia attempted to boost President Trump's campaign.",
      "Last month, she declassified documents dating back to 2016 and accused Obama administration officials of engaging in a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump \u2014 suggesting there could be \"criminal implications.\"",

    "summary": "Details are emerging about the possible motivation behind the firing of five senior FBI agents.",
    "story": [
      "When the FBI fired five veteran agents earlier this month, Director Kash Patel offered no explanation.",
      "Shock at the firings has continued to reverberate through the storied agency. And now, details are emerging about the possible motivation, several sources close to the agents tell CBS News.",
      "\"There is a despicable purge underway of senior FBI officials, all of whom have risen in their careers as nonpartisan, and who have been targeted for vindictive, political purposes,\" said Mark Zaid, a whistleblower attorney who represents a number of federal workers dismissed under President Trump.",
      "Without any public comment from FBI or Justice Department officials, the agents, including Brian Driscoll, who served for a short time as acting director at the start of the Trump administration, and Steven Jensen, head of the powerful Washington field office, were summarily fired and given little explanation for their removal. None had reached retirement age, meaning the abrupt dismissals will deprive them of their full pensions. One agent's expulsion came a month after his wife died of cancer.",
      "CBS News spoke with multiple sources close to the agents for this story. All of those interviewed spoke on the condition they not be identified for fear of retribution.",
      "By outward appearances, former acting FBI director was in good standing",
      "Some of the agents may have been targeted solely because they worked on one or more of the criminal investigations of Mr. Trump, while others who were ousted in an earlier spate of firings worked on the Biden administration's Jan. 6 investigations, sources close to the agents said. But the most senior agent, Driscoll, by outward appearances, was in good standing with Patel.",
      "Driscoll, a highly decorated agent who took part in numerous daring counterterrorism operations, began his short stint as acting director with what many agents viewed as a singular act of bravery, resisting calls from a top Trump appointee at the Justice Department to turn over the names of FBI employees who had participated in the Jan. 6 investigation. Nevertheless, Patel kept Driscoll on after his Senate confirmation, putting him in a high-profile post as head of the bureau's Critical Incident Response Group, which oversees the FBI's elite Hostage Rescue Team and its aviation unit.",
      "Jensen, a veteran agent who helped oversee the Jan. 6 investigation from his position as chief of the FBI's domestic terrorism section, was given a significant promotion by Patel to be the assistant director in charge of the Washington Field Office, one of the largest outposts in the country.",
      "One source with knowledge of the matter told CBS News that Patel relied on both agents and particularly admired Driscoll, whom he viewed as a swashbuckling tactical operator. Another said that the FBI director opposed some of the firings. \"I think Kash tried to save these people, honestly,\" the source said.",
      "Yet there are also some indications that both men may have crossed FBI leadership over loyalty and personnel matters.",
      "Some agents suspect political interference",
      "Zaid is part of a team of lawyers preparing to sue the federal government on behalf of some of the fired FBI agents. He told CBS News he suspects outside political interference.",
      "\"If you look at Patel's testimony from his confirmation hearing when he promised the committee there would be no politicization or retribution at the FBI under his leadership,\" Zaid told CBS News, \"you have to conclude that he was either lying or, giving him the benefit of the doubt, that he was directed to take these actions, and that could only come from the White House or the Justice Department.\"",
      "Patel promised senators during that hearing, \"There will be no retributive actions taken by any FBI, should I be confirmed as FBI director.\"",
      "Democrats on Capitol Hill see the firings as baldly political and damaging to U.S. national security. Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said in a statement to CBS News that he believes agents should be commended for their ability to enforce the law impartially.",
      "\"When we start purging agents for doing their jobs, instead of toeing a partisan line, we weaken our defense against everything from violent crime to foreign threats, and that makes us all less safe,\" Warner said.",
      "When asked who ordered the termination of the agents, the FBI declined to comment. A White House official deferred to the FBI to discuss bureau personnel matters.",
      "\"The suspendables\"",
      "There are other factors that have led some sources close to the agents and lawyers representing them to question whether the abrupt removals were the result of outside political interference, possibly by the White House.",
      "One question surrounds the role of a small band of right-leaning former agents who clashed with FBI leadership under directors James Comey and Christopher Wray and have been vocal critics of a bureau they believe was \"weaponized\" against them.",
      "Among them is Kyle Seraphin, one of several former FBI agents and whistleblowers who were suspended or had their security clearances revoked for alleged misconduct during the Biden administration. The former agents, including Seraphin, have referred to themselves as \"the suspendables.\" They have been targeting FBI officials they believe to be politically motivated.",
      "Seraphin has been among the most outspoken \u2014 and effective \u2014 members of the group. He has at times been critical of Patel for not aggressively and swiftly cleaning house at the bureau, but he has also had Patel's ear. Sources say he exercises considerable influence from his social media perch on X and his podcast, \"The Kyle Seraphin Show.\"",
      "Seraphin has publicly claimed some of the credit for last week's purge. On Aug. 4, he posted a thread on X under the heading \"VETTING CRISIS CONTINUES,\" in which he identified one of the fired agents, Christopher M. Meyer. Meyer had been serving as one of the pilots of the governmental planes used by Patel until he was notified of his termination.",
      "Seraphin had publicly speculated that Meyer had previously been on a squad based in the Washington Field Office that investigated Mr. Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents and conducted a search of Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate. The Justice Department brought criminal charges against Mr. Trump over the discovery of documents, but a judge eventually dismissed the case.",
      "Seraphin told CBS News in an interview, \"I identified that the person that ran the Mar-a-Lago case that resulted in a search warrant at the president's home was rubbing shoulders in close proximity with the FBI director\" as his pilot. He was concerned that \"this is a person that's now in the kind of buddy space of your FBI director, and he doesn't even know who he's speaking to.\"",
      "After publication of this article, Dan Eisenberg, a lawyer for Meyer, said he was not assigned to the Mar-a-Lago case and had not participated in the search. However, a source familiar with the matter said Meyer did work on the federal investigation into Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.",
      "On Alex Jones's \"InfoWars,\" Seraphin said he gave a \"heads up\" to an \"administration insider\" about Meyer. He told CBS News his \"Trump administration insider\" was \"in the president's orbit.\"",
      "How the firings unfolded",
      "On Aug. 4, Patel directed Driscoll to fire Meyer, sources told CBS News. When Driscoll asked on what grounds, he did not get what he considered a satisfactory answer from Patel, according to the source. Without it, Driscoll refused. Two days later, on Aug. 6, Driscoll was contacted by J. William Rivers, the No. 3 official at the FBI, and told he was being terminated, the source said. He was given no reason why but later received a letter formally notifying him that he was being fired.",
      "Around the same time, Jensen was also relieved of his duties. A source with knowledge of that matter said it was because he, too, refused to fire a subordinate agent in the Washington Field Office, though CBS News was not able to identify the person. Walter Giardina, a WFO agent who was also dismissed in the purge, had worked on a number of cases involving Mr. Trump and other members of his administration, including the prosecution of senior Trump aide Peter Navarro for contempt of Congress.",
      "The fifth agent fired earlier this month was Spencer Evans, who had been the special agent in charge of the FBI's Nevada field office until earlier this summer, when he was abruptly told he was being transferred to Huntsville, Alabama. By then, Trump supporters, including Seraphin, had been publicly critical of him over his enforcement of FBI COVID policies during the tenure of former FBI Director Christpher Wray.",
      "In April, Seraphin posted this on X:",
      "\"After @Kash_Patel was nominated, he asked me about people in the FBI who were problems. I said Spencer Evans, the SAC of Las Vegas, was the man who PERSONALLY denied the religious accommodations for Covid 19 shots and testing protocols.\"",
      "Seraphin's post continued: \"Kash said 'Gone.'\"",
      "Seraphin attached a video to his post that showed that months after that conversation, Evans was still leading the Las Vegas FBI office, and Patel was praising its work in tracking down criminals.",
      "Then, last Wednesday, two hours before getting into his car to drive across the country for his new assignment, Evans received a call notifying him that he too was being terminated. He was given no reason.",
      "Two days later Evans received a formal termination letter signed by Patel. It said Evans \"demonstrated a lack of reasonableness and overzealousness in the implementation of COVID-19 protocols and policies.\"",
      "After the August firings, Seraphin told CBS News a colleague in the FBI said to him, \"You have four scalps hanging off your belt this week.\" Seraphin excluded Driscoll from the count, and referred to him as \"collateral damage,\" and said he probably didn't deserve to be fired.",

      "The ruling halts school districts from implementing the measure, which mandated a 16-by-20-inch poster or framed copy of a specific English version of the Ten Commandments in every classroom.",
      "Federal judge in Texas cites First Amendment concerns",
      "In his decision, Biery wrote that requiring the displays could amount to unconstitutional religious coercion, pressuring students into religious observance and suppressing their own beliefs.",

    "summary": "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said 37 current and former government officials are losing their security clearances.",
    "story": [
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, said Tuesday in a memo posted on X that the Trump administration is revoking the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials.",
      "She accused them of having engaged in the \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence\" to advance personal or partisan goals, failing to safeguard classified information, failing to \"adhere to professional analytic tradecraft standards\" and other \"detrimental\" conduct that she did not describe in the memo.",
      "The memo offered no evidence to support the accusations.",
      "Many of the officials who were targeted left the government years ago after serving in both senior national security positions and lower-profile roles out of the public eye.",
      "Sam Vinograd, who was assistant secretary for counterterrorism, threat prevention and law enforcement policy in the Department of Homeland Security, is among the 37 former officials. She is also a national security contributor for CBS News. She has not yet responded to Gabbard's memo.",
      "Some of the officials worked on matters that have long infuriated President Trump, like the intelligence community assessment that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. And several showed their concerns about Mr. Trump by signing a critical letter in 2019 that was highlighted on social media last month by right-wing provocateur and close Trump ally Laura Loomer.",
      "The action reflects Mr. Trump's ongoing distrust of career intelligence officials whom he perceives as working against his interests. The revocation of clearances is a tactic the administration has used before \u2014 it has revoked the clearances of former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and several others. Critics say the tactic risks chilling dissenting voices from an intelligence community accustomed to drawing on a range of viewpoints before formulating an assessment. In Mr. Trump's first term, he\u00a0revoked\u00a0former CIA Director John Brennan's clearance.",
      "\"These are unlawful and unconstitutional decisions that deviate from well-settled, decades-old laws and policies that sought to protect against just this type of action,\" Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer whose own clearance has been revoked by the Trump administration, said in a statement.",
      "He called it hypocritical for the administration to \"claim these individuals politicized or weaponized intelligence.\"",
      "Gabbard on Tuesday sought to defend the move, which she said had been directed by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" she wrote on X. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\"",
      "In recent weeks, Gabbard and other Trump administration officials have revisited the intelligence community assessment published in 2017 on Russian election interference, including by declassifying a series of years-old documents meant to cast doubt on the legitimacy of its findings.",
      "Multiple government investigations have reached the same conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 election in sweeping fashion, including through a hack-and-leak operation of Democratic emails and a social media campaign aimed at sowing discord and swaying public opinion.",
      "But Mr. Trump has long resisted the assessment that Russian President Vladimir Putin interfered in his favor, and his Justice Department has authorized a grand jury investigation that could bring fresh scrutiny to Obama-era officials.",
      "Security clearances are important not only for current government workers but also former employees whose private-sector jobs require them to retain access to sensitive information. Stripping clearances from such employees could make it hard for them to do their jobs, though it's unclear how many of the former officials still have or require one.",
      "On his first day of office, Mr. Trump said he would revoke the security clearances of the more than four dozen former intelligence officials who signed a 2020 letter saying that the Hunter Biden laptop saga bore the hallmarks of a \"Russian information operation.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has attempted to revoke the security clearances for lawyers at a number of prominent law firms but was rebuffed by federal judges.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has directed government officials to probe any \"anti-American\" views and activities of immigrants applying for immigration benefits like green cards and work permits, further expanding the grounds that can be cited to deny those applications.",
      "The policy unveiled on Tuesday by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is the latest front in a broader Trump administration effort to restrict access to legal immigration benefits, including by broadening the levels of scrutiny and vetting to which applicants are subjected.",
      "The guidance issued this week directs officials at USCIS to determine whether applicants for certain immigration benefits have \"endorsed, promoted, supported, or otherwise espoused anti-American views or the views of a terrorist organization or group,\" including on social media. USCIS said those groups could include organizations that espouse or promote antisemitic views and terrorism.",
      "If officials find applicants have any ties to these groups or share their views, the directive instructs the officials to consider that an \"overwhelmingly negative factor\" justifying the denial of an application.",
      "The policy will affect requests for immigration benefits that are discretionary, meaning that USCIS can deny them even if applicants meet the qualifications outlined in U.S. law. Those cases include many applications for permanent U.S. residency (also known as a green card), work permits and status changes for foreign students.",
      "While it wasn't immediately clear how expansively USCIS will define \"anti-American\" views and activities, the agency said it would make the determination based on a provision of U.S. immigration law that bans immigrants from becoming U.S. citizens if it is found that they advocate for world communism, totalitarianism, violence against officials or the overthrow of the U.S. government.",
      "The guidance issued Tuesday also orders USCIS officials to probe whether applicants improperly used an immigration policy known as parole to enter the U.S. In the immigration context, parole allows for the arrival of immigrants who are otherwise ineligible to enter the U.S. It was used by the Biden administration on an unprecedented scale, mainly to ease pressure at the U.S.-Mexico border by offering migrants a legal way to enter the country.",
      "USCIS said it would look into whether applicants' parole applications contained \"false or fraudulent\" information.",
      "Matthew Tragesser, USCIS' top spokesperson, said Tuesday's memo underscored that U.S. immigration benefits should not be granted to people who \"despise the country.\"",
      "\"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is committed to implementing policies and procedures that root out anti-Americanism and supporting the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible,\" Tragesser added.",
      "Stephen Yale-Loehr, an expert in U.S. immigration law, expressed concerns about how USCIS would implement its latest guidance, calling the language in it \"very subjective.\"",
      "\"This memo gives USCIS adjudicators even more reasons than before to deny a petition on discretionary grounds,\" Yale-Loehr said.",
      "While President Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration central to his second-term agenda, his administration has also tightened access to the legal immigration system.",
      "Last week, USCIS said it would expand a \"good moral character\" assessment in the U.S. citizenship process. That requirement was historically satisfied when applicants lacked serious criminal histories or disqualifying conduct on their record. But now, officials have been instructed to weigh different positive factors, like applicants' involvement in the community, and negative factors, like repeat traffic infractions, to determine whether someone has good moral character.",
      "The Trump administration also previously announced measures to more aggressively screen those applying for a U.S. immigration status, including by placing a greater emphasis on the social media activity of applicants.",

    "summary": "As states prepare to implement changes to Medicaid required by President Trump's recent tax-and-spending law, tribal leaders say they are concerned Native American enrollees could lose their coverage.",
    "story": [
      "Jonnell Wieder earned too much money at her job to keep her Medicaid coverage when the COVID-19 public health emergency ended in 2023 and states resumed checking whether people were eligible for the program. But she was reassured by the knowledge that Medicaid would provide postpartum coverage for her and her daughter, Oakleigh McDonald, who was born in July of that year.",
      "Wieder is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana and can access some health services for free through her tribe's health clinics. But funding is limited, so, like a lot of Native American people, she relied on Medicaid for herself and Oakleigh.",
      "Months before Oakleigh's first birthday, the date when Wieder's postpartum coverage would come to an end, Wieder completed and returned paperwork to enroll her daughter in Healthy Montana Kids, the state's version of the Children's Health Insurance Program. But her paperwork, caught up in the lengthy delays and processing times for applications, did not go through.",
      "\"As soon as she turned 1, they cut her off completely,\" Wieder said.",
      "It took six months for Wieder to get Oakleigh covered again through Healthy Montana Kids. Before health workers in her tribe stepped in to help her resubmit her application, Wieder repeatedly called the state's health department. She said she would dial the call center when she arrived at her job in the morning and go about her work while waiting on hold, only for the call to be dropped by the end of the day.",
      "\"Never did I talk to anybody,\" she said.",
      "Wieder and Oakleigh's experience is an example of the chaos for eligible Medicaid beneficiaries caused by the process known as the \"unwinding,\" which led to millions of people in the U.S. losing coverage due to paperwork or other procedural issues. Now, tribal health leaders fear their communities will experience more health coverage disruptions when new federal Medicaid work and eligibility requirements are implemented by the start of 2027.",
      "The tax-and-spending law that President Trump signed this summer exempts Native Americans from the new requirement that some people work or do another qualifying activity a minimum number of hours each month to be eligible for Medicaid, as well as from more frequent eligibility checks. But as Wieder and her daughter's experience shows, they are not exempt from getting caught up in procedural disenrollments that could reemerge as states implement the new rules.",
      "\"We also know from the unwinding that that just doesn't always play out necessarily correctly in practice,\" said Joan Alker, who leads Georgetown University's Center for Children and Families. \"There's a lot to worry about.\"",
      "The new law is projected to increase the number of people who are uninsured by 10 million.",
      "The lessons of the unwinding suggest that \"deep trouble\" lies ahead for Native Americans who rely on Medicaid, according to Alker.",
      "Changes to Medicaid",
      "Mr. Trump's new law changes Medicaid rules to require some recipients ages 19 to 64 to log 80 hours of work or other qualifying activities per month. It also requires states to recheck those recipients' eligibility every six months, instead of annually. Both of these changes will be effective by the end of next year.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated in July that the law would reduce federal Medicaid spending by more than $900 billion over a decade. In addition, more than 4 million people enrolled in health plans through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are projected to become uninsured if Congress allows pandemic-era enhanced premium tax credits to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Wieder said she was lucky that the tribe covered costs and her daughter's care wasn't interrupted in the six months she didn't have health insurance. Citizens of federally recognized tribes in the U.S. can access some free health services through the Indian Health Service, the federal agency responsible for providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But free care is limited because Congress has historically failed to fully fund the Indian Health Service. Tribal health systems rely heavily on Medicaid to fill that gap. Native Americans are enrolled in Medicaid at higher rates than the White population and have higher rates of chronic illnesses, die more from preventable diseases, and have less access to care.",
      "Medicaid is the largest third-party payer to the Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities and organizations. Accounting for about two-thirds of the outside revenue the Indian Health Service collects, it helps tribal health organizations pay their staff, maintain or expand services, and build infrastructure. Tribal leaders say protecting Medicaid for Indian Country is a responsibility Congress and the federal government must fulfill as part of their trust and treaty obligations to tribes.",
      "Lessons learned during the unwinding",
      "The Trump administration prevented states from disenrolling most Medicaid recipients for the duration of the public health emergency starting in 2020. After those eligibility checks resumed in 2023, nearly 27 million people nationwide were disenrolled from Medicaid during the unwinding, according to an analysis by the Government Accountability Office published in June. The majority of disenrollments \u2014 about 70% \u2014 occurred for procedural reasons, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.",
      "CMS did not require state agencies to collect race and ethnicity data for their reporting during the unwinding, making it difficult to determine how many Native American and Alaska Native enrollees lost coverage.",
      "The lack of data to show how the unwinding affected the population makes it difficult to identify disparities and create policies to address them, said Latoya Hill, senior policy manager with KFF's Racial Equity and Health Policy program. KFF is a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "The National Council of Urban Indian Health, which advocates on public health issues for Native Americans living in urban parts of the nation, analyzed the Census Bureau's 2022 American Community Survey and KFF data in an effort to understand how disenrollment affected tribes. The council estimated more than 850,000 Native Americans had lost coverage as of May 2024. About 2.7 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives were enrolled in Medicaid in 2022, according to the council.",
      "The National Indian Health Board, a nonprofit that represents and advocates for federally recognized tribes, has been working with federal Medicaid officials to ensure that state agencies are prepared to implement the exemptions.",
      "\"We learned a lot of lessons about state capacity during the unwinding,\" said Winn Davis, congressional relations director for the National Indian Health Board.",
      "Nevada health officials say they plan to apply lessons learned during the unwinding and launch a public education campaign on the Medicaid changes in the new federal law. \"A lot of this will depend on anticipated federal guidance regarding the implementation of those new rules,\" said Stacie Weeks, director of the Nevada Health Authority.",
      "Staff at the Fallon Tribal Health Center in Nevada have become authorized representatives for some of their patients. This means that tribal citizens' Medicaid paperwork is sent to the health center, allowing staff to notify individuals and help them fill it out.",
      "Davis said the unwinding process showed that Native American enrollees are uniquely vulnerable to procedural disenrollment. The new law's exemption of Native Americans from work requirements and more frequent eligibility checks is the \"bare minimum\" to ensure unnecessary disenrollments are avoided as part of trust and treaty obligations, Davis said.",
      "Eligibility checks are \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\"",
      "The GAO said the process of determining whether individuals are eligible for Medicaid is \"complex\" and \"vulnerable to error\" in a 2024 report on the unwinding.",
      "\"The resumption of Medicaid eligibility redeterminations on such a large scale further compounded this complexity,\" the report said.",
      "It highlighted weaknesses across state systems. By April 2024, federal Medicaid officials had found nearly all states were out of compliance with redetermination requirements, according to the GAO. Eligible people lost their coverage, the accountability office said, highlighting the need to improve federal oversight.",
      "In Texas, for example, federal Medicaid officials found that 100,000 eligible people had been disenrolled due to, for example, the state system's failure to process their completed renewal forms or miscalculation of the length of women's postpartum coverage.",
      "Some states were not conducting ex parte renewals, in which a person's Medicaid coverage is automatically renewed based on existing information available to the state. That reduces the chance that paperwork is sent to the wrong address, because the recipient doesn't need to complete or return renewal forms.",
      "But poorly conducted ex parte renewals can lead to procedural disenrollments, too. More than 100,000 people in Nevada were disenrolled by September 2023 through the ex parte process. The state had been conducting the ex parte renewals at the household level, rather than by individual beneficiary, resulting in the disenrollment of still-eligible children because their parents were no longer eligible. Ninety-three percent of disenrollments in the state were for procedural reasons \u2014 the highest in the nation, according to KFF.",
      "Another issue the federal agency identified was that some state agencies were not giving enrollees the opportunity to submit their renewal paperwork through all means available, including mail, phone, online, and in person.",
      "State agencies also identified challenges they faced during the unwinding, including an unprecedented volume of eligibility redeterminations, insufficient staffing and training, and a lack of response from enrollees who may not have been aware of the unwinding.",
      "Native Americans and Alaska Natives have unique challenges in maintaining their coverage.",
      "Communities in rural parts of the nation experience issues with receiving and sending mail. Some Native Americans on reservations may not have street addresses. Others may not have permanent housing or change addresses frequently. In Alaska, mail service is often disrupted by severe weather. Another issue is the lack of reliable internet service on remote reservations.",
      "Tribal health leaders and patient benefit coordinators said some tribal citizens did not receive their redetermination paperwork or struggled to fill it out and send it back to their state Medicaid agency.",
      "The aftermath",
      "Although the unwinding is over, many challenges persist.",
      "Tribal health workers in Montana, Oklahoma, and South Dakota said some eligible patients who lost Medicaid during the unwinding had still not been reenrolled as of this spring.",
      "\"Even today, we're still in the trenches of getting individuals that had been disenrolled back onto Medicaid,\" said Rachel Arthur, executive director of the Indian Family Health Clinic in Great Falls, Montana, in May.",
      "Arthur said staff at the clinic realized early in the unwinding that their patients were not receiving their redetermination notices in the mail. The clinic is identifying people who fell off Medicaid during the unwinding and helping them fill out applications.",
      "Marlena Farnes, who was a patient benefit coordinator at the Indian Family Health Clinic during the Medicaid unwinding, said she tried for months to help an older patient with a chronic health condition get back on Medicaid. He had completed and returned his paperwork but still received a notice that his coverage had lapsed. After many calls to the state Medicaid office, Farnes said, state officials told her the patient's application had been lost.",
      "Another patient went to the emergency room multiple times while uninsured, Arthur said.",
      "\"I felt like if our patients weren't helped with follow-up, and that advocacy piece, their applications were not being seen,\" Farnes said. She is now the behavioral health director at the clinic.",
      "Montana was one of five states where more than 50% of enrollees lost coverage during the unwinding, according to the GAO. The other states are Idaho, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah. About 68% of Montanans who lost coverage were disenrolled for procedural reasons.",
      "In Oklahoma, eligibility redeterminations remain challenging to process, said Yvonne Myers, a Medicaid and Affordable Care Act consultant for Citizen Potawatomi Nation Health Services. That's causing more frequent coverage lapses, she said.",
      "Myers said she thinks Republican claims of \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" are overstated.",
      "\"I challenge some of them to try to go through an eligibility process,\" Myers said. \"The way they're going about it is making it for more hoops to jump through, which ultimately will cause people to fall off.\"",
      "The unwinding showed that state systems can struggle to respond quickly to changes in Medicaid, leading to preventable erroneous disenrollments. Individuals were often in the dark about their applications and struggled to reach state offices for answers. Tribal leaders and health experts are raising concerns that those issues will continue and worsen as states implement the requirements of the new law.",
      "Georgia, the only state with an active Medicaid work requirement program, has shown that the changes can be difficult for individuals to navigate and costly for a state to implement. More than 100,000 people have applied for Georgia's Pathways program, but only about 8,600 were enrolled as of the end of July.",
      "Alker, of Georgetown, said Congress took the wrong lesson from the unwinding in adding more restrictions and red tape.",
      "\"It will make unwinding pale in comparison in terms of the number of folks that are going to lose coverage,\" Alker said.",

      "Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen announced plans Tuesday for an immigration detention center in a farming area in the state's southwest corner as President Trump's administration\u00a0races to expand\u00a0the infrastructure necessary for increasing deportations.",
      "Pillen said he and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had agreed to use an existing minimum security prison work camp in rural McCook to house people awaiting deportation and being held for other immigration proceedings.",
      "The new facility was dubbed the \"Cornhusker Clink\" last week by Rob Jeffreys, director of the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services. It can accommodate 200 people with plans to expand to 300. McCook is about 210 miles west of Lincoln, the state capital.",
      "\"This is about keeping Nebraskans \u2013 and Americans across our country \u2013 safe,\" Pillen said in a statement.",
      "Pillen announced he would order the Nebraska National Guard to provide administrative and logistical support to Nebraska-based immigration agents. About 20 Guard soldiers will be involved.",
      "He also said the Nebraska State Patrol would sign an agreement that enables troopers to help federal immigration agents make arrests.",
      "DHS said in a news release that the agreement with the state to expand Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention space was made possible by Mr. Trump's\u00a0\"big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0passed by Congress last month. The funding bill included $45 billion for ICE to expand its detention system, and nearly $30 billion for ICE agents and resources.",
      "Jeffreys said the 186 people currently at McCook will be transferred to other state corrections facilities so the camp can be repurposed.",
      "The facility will be run by the state of Nebraska but will be paid for by the federal government. All the people expected to be held there will be low to medium-risk detainees, Jeffreys said.",
      "Jeffreys estimated it will take 45 to 60 days to relocate all the current McCook population while a prison in Lincoln is undergoing repairs from recent storm damage. It wasn't immediately clear how quickly ICE might start sending detainees to McCook.",
      "But Jeffreys said it's already set up to house people, so detainees won't be housed in tents or other temporary quarters. \"That facility has already been accredited. It's ready in the event that we are to move our folks out and move detainees in,\" he said.",
      "\"Thanks to Governor Pillen for his partnership to help remove the worst of the worst out of our country,\" Noem said in a statement Tuesday. \"If you are in America illegally, you could find yourself in Nebraska's Cornhusker Clink. Avoid arrest and self deport now using the CBP Home App.\"",
      "The Nebraska plan has already raised concerns.",
      "In a\u00a0video\u00a0posted to social media, state Sen. Megan Hunt, an independent, blasted a lack of transparency about plans for a detention center, citing her unfulfilled request to the governor and executive branch for emails and other records about the plan.",
      "She urged people to support local immigrant rights groups, and said any response by the Legislature would not come until next year \u2014 and only with enough support from lawmakers.",
      "\"The No. 1 thing we need to do is protect our neighbors, protect the people in our communities who are being targeted by these horrible people, these horrible organizations that are making choices to lock up, detain, disappear our neighbors and families and friends,\" Hunt said.",
      "Six protesters sat in the hallway outside the governor's office Tuesday afternoon making signs that said, \"No Nazi Nebraska\" and \"ICE = Gestapo.\"",
      "Maghie Miller-Jenkins of Lincoln said she doesn't think an ICE detention center is a good idea, adding the state should tackle problems like child hunger and homelessness. \"This state has numerous things they could focus on that would benefit the constituents,\" Miller-Jenkins said.",
      "The Trump administration is adding\u00a0new detention facilities across the country\u00a0to hold the growing number of immigrants it has arrested and accused of being in the country illegally. Older and newer U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement centers were holding more than 56,000 immigrants in June, the most since 2019.",
      "Other new and planned immigration detention facilities in the U.S. include the\u00a0remote detention center in the Florida Everglades\u00a0known as\u00a0\"Alligator Alcatraz,\"\u00a0which opened last month. It's designed to hold up to 3,000 detainees in temporary tent structures. When Mr. Trump toured it,\u00a0he suggested it could be a model\u00a0for future lockups nationwide.",
      "When federal officials announced the opening of the Florida detention center, they said its focus would be on rounding up individuals with a criminal record \u2014 people that Mr. Trump and border czar Tom Homan have called\u00a0\"the worst of the worst.\"\u00a0However, many people who have been locked up there\u00a0do not have criminal records, CBS News previously reported.",
      "The Florida facility has also been the\u00a0subject of legal challenges\u00a0by attorneys who allege violations of due process there, including the rights of detainees to meet with their attorneys, limited access to immigration courts and poor living conditions. Critics have been trying to stop further construction and operations until it comes into compliance with federal environmental laws.",
      "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced last week that his administration is preparing to open a second facility, dubbed \"Deportation Depot,\" at a state prison in north Florida. It's expected to have 1,300 immigration beds, though that capacity could be expanded to 2,000, state officials said.",
      "Also last week, officials in the rural Tennessee town of Mason voted to approve agreements to turn a former prison into an immigration detention facility operated by a private company, despite loud objections from residents and activists during a contentious public meeting.",
      "And the Trump administration announced plans earlier this month for a 1,000-bed\u00a0detention center in Indiana\u00a0that would be dubbed \"Speedway Slammer,\" prompting a backlash in the Midwestern state that hosts the Indianapolis 500 auto race.",

    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration \u2014 an idea she said was \"specifically at the request\" of President Trump.",
      "Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.",
      "She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.",
      "\"That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,\" Noem said.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.",
      "Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.",
      "\"The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,\" she said.",
      "She said that in addition to barriers like the one she visited Tuesday, the department is also working on \"water-borne infrastructure.\" Long sections of the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico sit along the Rio Grande River in Texas.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing forward with completing the wall at the same time that the number of people crossing the border illegally has plummeted. In the month of June, just over 6,000 migrants were apprehended along the southern border, a decades-long low \u2014 and a steep dropoff from the Biden administration, when border arrests peaked at upwards of 6,000 per day.",

    "story": [
      "Lawyers for Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador only to be brought back to the U.S. to face smuggling charges, asked a federal judge in Nashville on Tuesday to dismiss his indictment, calling it a \"vindictive and selective prosecution\" by the Trump administration.",
      "The attorneys claimed the Trump administration is only prosecuting Abrego Garcia for alleged human smuggling crimes because he challenged his deportation to El Salvador, where he was initially held at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT. His lawyers have said their client was beaten at that prison before being transferred to a lower-level security facility.",
      "Abrego Garcia entered the U.S. illegally in 2011 at age 16 and was granted legal protection from being deported to his home country of El Salvador in 2019. But he was still arrested by immigration officials and deported there earlier this year.",
      "While the Trump administration initially conceded in federal court that his deportation to El Salvador had been a mistake, it has since sought to undermine Abrego Garcia's case in the court of public opinion, accusing him of being a gang member, highlighting domestic violence allegations and charging him with smuggling.",
      "Abrego Garcia has remained in pre-trial detention since he was flown back to the U.S. in early June. The Justice Department has alleged in its criminal indictment that before his deportation to El Salvador, Abrego Garcia transported immigrants, including minors, who had crossed the U.S.-Mexico border illegally as part of a smuggling conspiracy.",
      "One of the main pieces of evidence cited by prosecutors is a 2022 traffic stop during which Tennessee troopers stopped Abrego Garcia as he was driving eight\u00a0people without any luggage across state lines. Abrego Garcia's lawyers said it was telling that the federal government did not prosecute him until after his deportation, which gained widespread national attention.",
      "\"Indeed, the only possible explanation for the timing of the charges here is that the government chose to use this prosecution to punish Mr. Abrego for exercising his right to challenge the violations of due process that led to his unconstitutional deportation, incarceration, and torture in El Salvador,\" the lawyers said in a legal filing.",
      "\"This, coupled with the government's statements clearly showing the intent to retaliate against Mr. Abrego for pursuing civil remedies for his illegal deportation, unquestionably establishes discriminatory intent,\" the filing continued.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Trump administration had \"gone to extreme lengths to make a criminal case,\" including by using a convicted smuggler who has been deported five times as its \"star cooperator.\" They said the witness was getting lenient treatment from the government in exchange for his cooperation, even though he was purportedly the head of a smuggling business and Abrego Garcia was \"allegedly a mere driver.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers are also asking the federal court in Nashville to order their client's release from pre-trial detention once a stay on that order lapses on Friday, Aug. 22. While the court ordered Abrego Garcia's pre-trial release earlier this summer, it paused that order after his lawyers expressed concerns that their client would be immediately detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and processed for deportation.",
      "If he's released, the lawyers asked the court to give Abrego Garcia 48 hours to report to pre-trial supervision in Maryland. If there's a release hearing, the lawyers asked the court to order the U.S. Marshals Service to transport Abrego Garcia from the court back to the detention facility where he's being held, so he can be released from there. The attorneys said they've hired a private security group to take Abrego Garcia from Tennessee to Maryland.",
      "In July, a federal judge in Maryland ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia to Maryland, where he lived with his U.S. citizen wife and child, so he can be supervised by ICE there. She also blocked ICE from immediately re-detaining him in Tennessee and from deporting him without some degree of notice, but did not forbid the possibility of the agency re-arresting him in Maryland.",
      "CBS News reached out to representatives for the Department of Justice asking for comment on Tuesday's legal filings.",
      "In a statement, Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Abrego Garcia \"will never walk America's streets again,\" calling him a \"gang member and human trafficker.\"",

      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News.

      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",

Under a law signed by former President Joe Biden last year, ByteDance was required to either sell TikTok's U.S. operations by Jan. 19 or face a ban from app stores. But Mr. Trump has repeatedly extended that deadline, giving ByteDance more time to find a buyer.",
      "The most recent extension runs out on Sept. 17. It's unclear if Mr. Trump is planning on extending the deadline again.",
      "When the last extension was granted in mid-June, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said at the time that the administration was \"working to ensure this deal is closed so that the American people can continue to use TikTok with the assurance that their data is safe and secure.\"",

      "Members of both parties have expressed concerns about TikTok, arguing its Beijing-based parent company could be forced to share U.S. users' data with the Chinese government, or could manipulate the types of content promoted by the app's powerful algorithm to advance China's foreign policy goals. TikTok has long denied that it's subject to the Chinese government's whims, and has said American user data is stored on U.S. servers.",
      "Mr. Trump's views on TikTok have shifted in recent years. He tried to ban the app during his first term, citing national security risks, but reversed course during the 2024 presidential race, arguing a ban on TikTok would only empower Facebook.

    "story": [
      "Twenty states and the District of Columbia sued the Justice Department on Monday for adding a new immigration enforcement rule to federal grants that assist victims of crime \u2014 arguing it's part of the Trump administration's crackdown against \"sanctuary states.\"",
      "The lawsuit focuses on the Office for Victims of Crime, a 42-year-old division of the Justice Department that hands out more than $1 billion per year to all 50 states to compensate crime victims and fund programs like local crisis counseling centers, emergency shelters, domestic abuse hotlines and victim advocacy services.",
      "The Trump-era Justice Department added a new condition to those grants that denies funding to any program that \"violates (or promotes or facilitates the violation of) federal immigration law.\" That includes failing to \"give access to [Department of Homeland Security] agents, or honor DHS requests.\"",
      "But the states that joined Monday's lawsuit argue that the rule is illegal, since the Reagan-era law that set up the federal government's crime victim grant programs doesn't say anything about immigration enforcement.",
      "\"The challenged conditions would force these States into an untenable position: either forfeit access to critical resources for vulnerable crime victims and their families, or accept unlawful conditions, allowing the federal government to conscript state and local officials to enforce federal immigration law,\" the states and D.C. argue in the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Rhode Island.",
      "Mostly Democratic states joined the suit, including California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota and Colorado. Collectively, they've received more than $500 million a year in crime victim grants since 2021, according to the lawsuit.",
      "The states asked a federal judge to block the new rules and declare them illegal. They said they need \"urgent relief\" since applications for most of the grants are due Wednesday.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on the lawsuit.",
      "As President Trump seeks to dramatically ramp up arrests of suspected undocumented immigrants, his administration has taken aim at so-called sanctuary cities and states, which generally limit local police from cooperating with federal immigration agents.",
      "Within hours of his swearing-in on Jan. 20, the president signed an executive order directing officials to ensure that sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the Justice Department to identify and pause grants to groups that \"support or provide services to removable or illegal aliens.\"",
      "The administration argues that sanctuary cities and states make it harder to enforce immigration laws, especially against criminals who end up in state or local custody.",
      "Supporters of sanctuary laws, however, argue that forcing local law enforcement officers to work with immigration agents makes migrants less likely to cooperate with the police. Monday's lawsuit said the conditions on crime victim grants risk \"destroying trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities that is critical to preventing and responding to crime.\"",
      "\"The federal government is attempting to use crime victim funds as a bargaining chip to force states into doing its bidding on immigration enforcement,\" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement.",
      "Earlier this year, the Justice Department cut off hundreds of federal grant programs, including money for nonprofits that help victims of hate crimes, sex trafficking and violence against children, according to a list obtained by CBS News. The heads of some nonprofits warned they would need to lay off staff or shutter crime victim hotlines.",
      "At the time, a Justice Department spokesperson told CBS News: \"We are confident that these cuts are consistent with the administration's priorities while at the same time protecting services that tangibly impact victims.\"",
      "A group of anti-domestic-violence nonprofits also sued the Justice Department earlier this year for banning grant funding under the Violence Against Women Act to groups that promote \"gender ideology\" or diversity, equity and inclusion programs. A judge paused that rule.",

    "story": [
      "In the rugged North Cascade Mountains of Washington State, no one likely knows this glacier better than Mauri Pelto, who says, \"My life has been shaped by this ice.\"",
      "For more than 40 years, Pelto, a glaciologist and a professor at Nichols College in Massachusetts, has returned to this remote wilderness. \"We got 6,000 measurements on this glacier,\" he said.",
      "Today, the crunch of footsteps in the snow is now rivaled by the sound of melting ice. \"It's always melting off,\" he said. \"The crevasses are changing. We can hear the water flowing under our feet.\"",
      "Pelto founded the North Cascade Glacier Climate Project as a grad student in 1984. He vowed to measure these glaciers every summer for 50 years. This is Year 42. In that time the glaciers have changed more than he has, shrinking by 40%. Some have disappeared.",
      "Pelto's work has been featured by NASA, and fed into a worldwide glacier database. Of the 47 glaciers he has studied, returning to them year after year, he says 12 are now gone, \"nine of them just in the last five years.\"",
      "Climate scientists say warmer summers and drier winters, driven by our burning of fossil fuels, are accelerating the loss. Seven of the 10 worst years for glacier melt worldwide have happened since 2010, according to Climate Central.",
      "Or just ask Mauri Pelto where the ice used to be. \"Almost 50 feet above my head just a decade ago,\" he said.",
      "Glaciers are Earth's water towers, storing 70% of the freshwater supply, vital for drinking, farming, and the health of many ecosystems. As they melt, sea levels are rising, and coastal flooding is getting worse.",
      "During his annual treks to the North Cascades, Pelto has hiked nearly 6,000 miles, and slept 800 nights in a tent. \u00a0\"We got our picture window,\" he said of the view. \"It's also one of those places that's really special to us as a family.\"",
      "His son Ben, daughter Jill, and now his nine-month-old granddaughter Wren have joined him in the field.",
      "Jill Pelto has spent 17 summers by her dad's side, but she doesn't just collect data. As the project's art director, she paints it. The data points that she and her dad measure eventually will go into her art. \"Data is a story about something in the real world and that story has meaning and emotion,\" she said. \"And that's what I'm trying to bring into my art.\"",
      "Her watercolor paintings are more than just beautiful landscapes; they reveal the science. Look closely and you see a bar graph of glacier decline in the North Cascades. One piece showing temperature rise and ice loss made the cover of Time magazine.",
      "Jill said, \"I think sometimes when people see data there's this instant reaction, and so it's not like the data is any different in my art, but something about that combination maybe gets people to kind of put down the wall of like, 'Oh, I can't understand this,' or 'You know, this is not something I'm interested in.'\"",
      "I said, \"The average person is not going to read a scientific report, but they will see a painting. And it does impact you in a different way.\"",
      "\"Yes, definitely,\" said Jill.",
      "Her art has given her dad a new way to share the story he's been recording for the past 42 years. And it's also changed their relationship: \"We do it so seamlessly at this point,\" Mauri said.",
      "\"Feels like you're one team out here?\" I asked.",
      "\"Yeah,\" he replied.",
      "Jill added, \"This bigger project just means so much to us and has shaped our lives. So, sharing that year after year is beyond special.\"",
      "And now, Mauri Pelto has just eight summers left to fulfill his 50-year promise. Asked what he thinks it will be like to no longer come out to the glaciers, Mauri replied, \"I don't know, I can't remember what it was like to not come out here. This landscape has been shaped by ice, and so to understand the landscape and the ice, you really have to walk across it.\"",

      "Also participating in the event in Brooklyn, New York, were popular podcast host Alex Cooper, Formula One driver Lando Norris and singer Nick Jonas.",
      "Google's new suite of products includes four Pixel 10 phones, the Pixel 4 Watch\u00a0and a revamped set of Pixel earbuds. The hardware will include new AI features designed to help users retrieve information, automatically create videos and snap better photos.",
      "Google has been steadily layering AI capabilities into its Pixel products since 2023 as the Alphabet-owned competes with Apple, which tech analysts note has been slower to integrate AI features into the iPhone.",
      "The Pixel phones, now on their 10th generation, will have an AI-powered feature called \"Magic Cue\" designed to anticipate a person's information needs. For example, if travelers use the device to call their airline, the phone is able to recognize the number and display their flight information, according to Google.",
      "The phones also comes with an AI tool called \"Camera Coach\" that will automatically suggest the best framing and lighting angle as the lens is being aimed at a subject.",
      "Rick Osterloh, Google's senior vice president of platforms and device, said during Wednesday's event that adding AI to its Pixel devices is aimed at making the phones more \"personal and proactive.\"",
      "\"So it doesn't just wait and listen to your requests \u2014 it starts to anticipate them because it knows what you're trying to do,\" he added. \"We call this personal intelligence.\"",
      "The basic Pixel 10 phone costs $800, the Pro runs $1,000 and the Pro XL goes for $1,200; a foldable version of the phone is also available for $1,800. Three new Pixel phones will be available in stores starting August 28, but consumers will have to wait until October 9 to get their hands on Pixel 10 Pro Fold.",
      "The Pixel 4 Watch will be the company's first smartwatch equipped with Gemini, Google's AI assistant. The device will include new health and safety features, such as emergency satellite communications.",

      "\"If you keep at it and say, 'no, you're wrong. You're wrong' \u2014 eventually AI will say, 'I'm sorry, I was wrong.' Doing that with your class can show you that AI isn't really as smart as you think it is,\" Ong said.",

      "Ong said if AI is already here, \"let's try to figure this out to help our kids continue to learn and grow.\"",
      "However, critics cite cheating concerns and Microsoft's own research, which showed a self-reported decline in critical thinking skills when AI was not used responsibly.",
      "\"This is a way to get profits,\" said former high school teacher and AFT member Lois Weiner.",
      "She thinks teachers would be better served by more support within schools than by an alliance with Silicon Valley.",
      "\"There is so much drudgery in the job, but the answer to that is to improve the conditions of teachers' work,\" said Weiner, adding that AI does not accomplish improving work conditions for teachers.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:23:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin was beginning to move away from the North Carolina coast early Thursday after bringing tropical storm conditions to the state's Outer Banks, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said as it cautioned people not to swim at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "Erin\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but storm surge warnings\u00a0remain in place for parts of North Carolina and parts of the Outer Banks are under evacuation orders. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein\u00a0declared a state of emergency\u00a0in the state.",
      "\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. update Thursday. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a tropical storm warning is in effect for a swath of the North Carolina and Virginia coastline.",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm early Thursday as it churned over the Atlantic off the southeast U.S. coast.",
      "It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded, and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "As of 8 a.m. Thursday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph and was moving north-northeast at 17 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was about 210 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and 440 miles west-northwest of Bermuda.",
      "The hurricane center said \"gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days\" and \"Erin is expected to become post-tropical by Saturday.\"",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is a \"large and growing\" storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 105 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 320 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. A tropical storm watch was posted for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, though tropical storm conditions were hitting parts of the Outer Banks early Thursday.",
      "Forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge combining with high tide could flood areas with as much as 2 feet to 4 feet of water. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding.",
      "Rough ocean conditions were also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were vulnerable to waves of 15 feet to 20 feet, forecasters said. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

    "summary": "The U.S. has expanded its campaign to persuade countries to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
    "story": [
      "Internal government documents obtained by CBS News show the Trump administration has expanded its campaign to persuade countries around the world to aid its crackdown on illegal immigration by accepting deportations of migrants who are not their own citizens.",
      "The documents indicate Uganda in East Africa recently agreed to accept deportees from the U.S. who hail from other countries on the continent, as long as they don't have criminal histories. It's unclear how many deportees Uganda would ultimately accept under the arrangement with the U.S. government.",
      "Honduras' government has also agreed to receive deportees from other Spanish-speaking countries in Latin America, including families traveling with children, the documents show. The government of Honduras agreed to a relatively small number of deportations \u2014 just several hundred over two years \u2014 but the documents indicate it could decide to accept more.",
      "Both agreements are based on a \"safe third country\" provision of U.S. immigration law that allows officials to reroute asylum-seekers to countries that are not their own if the U.S. government makes a determination that those nations can fairly hear their claims for humanitarian protection.",
      "The two bilateral deals outlined in the internal documents are part of a large-scale diplomatic effort that President Trump's administration has staged to strike deportation arrangements with nations across several continents, including those with problematic human rights records. The administration has argued those agreements are key to its mass deportation campaign, since there are some migrants who can't easily be deported to their home countries because of strained diplomatic relations or other reasons.",
      "At least a dozen countries have already accepted or agreed to accept deportees from other nations since the second Trump administration took office, and U.S. officials have been aggressively courting other governments. Internal government documents show the Trump administration has also asked countries like Ecuador and Spain to receive these so-called third country deportees from the U.S.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests to comment on CBS News' reporting.",
      "A senior State Department official said, \"We don't comment on the content of private diplomatic negotiations, but the State Department is doing everything possible to support the President's policy of keeping Americans safe by removing illegal aliens who have no right to be in the United States.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Uganda's government confirmed the deportation agreement with the U.S., saying the two countries are working on implementation details. The country's foreign ministry said Uganda \"prefers\" to receive migrants from other parts of Africa.",
      "\"The Agreement is in respect of Third Country Nationals who may not be granted asylum in the United States but are reluctant to or may have concerns about returning to their countries of origin,\" Uganda's foreign ministry said in a statement. \"This is a temporary arrangement with conditions including that individuals with criminal records and unaccompanied minors will not be accepted.\"",
      "Earlier this summer, the Supreme Court gave the Trump administration the green light to deport migrants to third countries with a minimal degree of notice and due process. The decision paved the way for the administration to continue expanding a practice it has relied on since the beginning of Mr. Trump's second term.",
      "In February, the Trump administration convinced Costa Rica and Panama to take in several hundred African and Asian migrants who had claimed asylum along the U.S.-Mexico border. Then, in March, the U.S. flew more than 200 Venezuelans accused of gang membership to El Salvador, where they were held incommunicado for months at a notorious prison until they were returned to Venezuela last month under a prisoner swap.",
      "The administration has also sent immigrants convicted of violent crimes and who hail from Cuba, Jamaica, Mexico, Laos, Myanmar, Yemen and other countries to violence-torn South Sudan and the tiny southern African kingdom of Eswatini. Guatemala, Kosovo and Rwanda have announced they will receive deportees from the U.S. who come from other nations.",
      "Last week, the State Department said the U.S. had signed a \"safe third country\" asylum agreement with Paraguay. Mexico, under an arrangement that predates Mr. Trump's second term, accepts the return of some Latin American migrants who crossed the U.S. southern border illegally.",
      "Human rights advocates have strongly denounced the Trump administration effort, saying migrants could be deported to countries where they could be harmed or returned to the place they fled. Some of the countries persuaded to sign deportation agreements have been plagued by reports of human rights abuses.",
      "In a report released last week, the State Department described \"negative developments in the human rights situation in Uganda,\" citing unlawful killings, \"arbitrary\" arrests, disappearances and a lack of action from the government to curb human rights abuses. The report also noted, however, that Uganda has worked with United Nations officials to provide humanitarian protection to refugees.",
      "Doris Meissner, who oversaw the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service under the Clinton administration, said the U.S. government has long faced difficulties deporting some migrants due to diplomatic constraints. But she noted efforts to deport them to third countries were generally undertaken in \"exceptional\" cases only.",
      "Meissner, who is now a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute think tank,  suggested the Trump administration may be employing different sources of leverage \u2014 like threats of visa sanctions and funding commitments \u2014 to persuade as many countries as possible to take in deportees from other nations.",
      "Noting deportations to third countries remain relatively limited in scale, Meissner said a main driver behind the Trump administration's diplomatic efforts is a desire to send a message of deterrence to those in the U.S. illegally, one that highlights the possibility that they could be sent to distant countries where they have no ties.",
      "\"The broader reason beyond that is fear and intimidation and ultimately, incentivizing self deportation,\" she said.",

      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",
      "The press office of Venezuela's government did not respond to a request for comment from the AP on the deployment of the U.S. destroyers. But without mentioning the ships, Foreign Minister Yvan Gil, in a statement on Tuesday, dismissed the Trump administration's drug-trafficking accusations against Venezuela.",
      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",
      "On Monday, Maduro said the U.S. had increased its threats against Venezuela and announced the planned deployment of more than 4.5 million militia members around the country. The militias were created by then-President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez to incorporate volunteers who could assist the armed forces in the defense of external and domestic attacks.",
      "\"The empire has gone mad and has renewed its threats to Venezuela's peace and tranquility,\" Maduro said at an event in Caracas, without mentioning any specific action.",
      "Maduro was indicted in a New York federal court in 2020, during the first Trump presidency, along with several close allies on federal charges of narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine. The U.S. offered a $15 million reward for his arrest at the time.",

    "summary": "Google on Thursday released a new methodology for measuring the environmental impact of AI text prompts.",
    "story": [
      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The tech giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years. At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "There are currently no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",
      "The quality of Gemini's responses also improved over the same time period, the company said.",

      "Hurricane Erin battered North Carolina's Outer Banks with strong winds and waves that flooded part of the main highway and surged under beachfront homes before the huge storm slowly began to move away from the East Coast early Thursday.",
      "The National Hurricane center in Miami said Erin wouldn't make landfall along the East Coast before turning farther out to sea. The center said, \"Gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days\" and Erin \"is expected to become post-tropical by Saturday.\"",
      "Tropical storm conditions were evident early Thursday in parts of the Outer Banks, the center said. In Bermuda, residents and tourists were told to stay out of the water with rough seas expected through Friday.",
      "As Erin's outer bands brushed the Outer Banks, water poured onto the main route connecting the barrier islands and a handful of stilted homes precariously perched above the beach. By Wednesday evening, officials had closed Highway 12 on Hatteras Island as the surge increased and waves rose. The road remained closed Thursday. Ocracoke Island's connection to its ferry terminal was cut off.",
      "Highway 12 completely submerged north of Hatteras Village, as seen by webcams from NCDOT. The next two high tide cycles will likely bring more severe overwash than what we've seen so far this evening. pic.twitter.com/ihNOsFfZUA",
      "Authorities predicted that the largest swells during high tide would cut off villages and homes on the Outer Banks and whip up life-threatening rip currents from Florida to New England.",
      "Beaches were closed to swimming Wednesday and Thursday in New York City, and some others in New Jersey, Maryland and Delaware were temporarily off-limits. Widespread, moderate coastal flooding was forecast for low-lying areas of Long Island and parts of New York City.",

      "\"You can be aware all you want,\" he said. \"It can still be dangerous.\"",
      "A combination of fierce winds and huge waves estimated at about 20 feet could cause coastal flooding in many beachfront communities, North Carolina officials warned.",

      "\"We probably wouldn't stay if it was coming directly at us,\" said Rob Temple, who operates sailboat cruises on Ocracoke.",
      "His biggest concern was whether the main route would wash out and if tourists and delivery trucks may be cut off from the thin stretch of low-lying islands, which are increasingly vulnerable to storm surges.",
      "Erin has become an unusually large and deceptively worrisome system, with tropical storm-force winds spreading some 320 miles from the storm's center early Thursday, the hurricane center said.",
      "It remained a Category 2 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds around 105 mph, the center said. Erin was about 205 miles east-southeast of Cape Hatteras and moving north-northeast at 17 mph (28 kph).",
      "The hurricane center was also watching two tropical disturbances far out in the Atlantic that could develop into named storms in coming days. With thousands of miles of warm ocean water, hurricanes known as Cape Verde storms are some of the most dangerous that threaten North America.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 05:00:09 -0400",
    "summary": "Jerome Powell will address the state of the U.S. economy \u2014 and perhaps offer hints about interest rates \u2014 in a closely watched speech this week. Here's what to expect.",
    "story": [
      "When Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell takes the stage Friday at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming, economic forum, he will face pressures ranging from President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation to a recent mix of worrying economic data.",
      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, will likely be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with\u00a0 most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a00.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday",
      "\"The labor market will be the swing factor on whether the Fed cuts interest rates in September or not,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "The Menendez brothers are set for long-awaited parole board hearings in California this week after spending nearly 30 years in prison for the 1989 killings of their parents, Kitty and Jose Menendez.",
      "In May, Erik and Lyle Menendez, who were sentenced in 1996 to life without the possibility of parole, saw\u00a0their sentences reduced by a judge to 50 years to life, making them eligible for parole under California's youth offender law because they were under the age of 26 when they committed their crimes.",
      "The brothers will appear separately before the state parole board to argue that they no longer pose a threat to public safety, will not re-offend and take full responsibility for their crimes. Erik Menendez will have his hearing on Thursday morning, followed by Lyle Menendez on Friday. The brothers are expected to appear virtually from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego.",
      "The Menendez brothers' appellate attorney, Mark Geragos, has said their parole hearings should be about redemption\u00a0and not about relitigating the facts of the case. Several family members\u00a0of the brothers have spoken out in favor of their release from prison, saying they have forgiven them for what they did.",
      "\"I'm hopeful and glad we're one huge step closer to bringing the boys home,\" Geragos said after the brothers were resentenced.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "When did the Menendez brothers go to prison?",
      "On Aug. 20, 1989, the Menendez brothers' parents,\u00a0Kitty and Jose Menendez, were shot multiple times at close range with a shotgun inside their Beverly Hills home.",
      "On March 8, 1990, the brothers were arrested for the killings of their parents after police received a tip from Judalon Smyth, the girlfriend of a psychologist whom Lyle and Erik Menendez had been talking to.",
      "In 1994, a judge ruled a mistrial after separate juries for the brothers were unable to reach a unanimous verdict. The following year, prosecutors decided to retry them.",
      "In 1996, after days of deliberation, the jury found the Menendez brothers guilty of first-degree murder. They were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "Where does the Los Angeles County DA stand on the Menendez brothers' case?",
      "Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman has been\u00a0outspoken\u00a0that the brothers should not be released, claiming they have continued to lie about alleged physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Earlier this month, he\u00a0filed a 132-page response\u00a0outlining his office's opposition to their petition for a new trial, which is still pending.",
      "In 2023, the brothers submitted a habeas corpus petition seeking a new trial based on evidence that was not originally presented to the court. One of the new pieces of evidence was allegations made by a former member of the boy band Menudo, who alleged he was sexually abused by Jose Menendez.",
      "The second piece of evidence was a letter from Erik Menendez written before the murders, which was not found until several years ago, that described his alleged abuse by his father.",
      "Ahead of the parole hearings, Hochman reiterated his office's stance\u00a0opposing the Menendez brothers' possible release. He claimed that the brothers have \"never fully accepted responsibility for the horrific murders of their parents.\"",
      "He added that they continue to pose a risk to society and have failed to show that they are \"fully rehabilitated.\"",
      "\"While recent documentaries and films have drawn renewed attention to this case, parole decisions must be based solely on the facts and the law,\" Hochman said. \"This case, like all cases \u2014 especially those that captivate the public \u2014 must be viewed with a critical eye.\"",
      "How do parole hearings work in California?",
      "Parole hearings are held to determine if an inmate currently poses an \"unreasonable risk of danger to society,\" if they are released from prison, according to the CDCR.",
      "The brothers will have independent parole hearings before a panel that will determine whether they are suitable for release.",
      "Will the Menendez brothers be released immediately if they're granted parole?",
      "Following the hearings, the board's decision is considered a \"proposed decision\" and can be reviewed by the board's chief counsel within 120 days.",
      "If the board does grant either of the brothers parole, California Gov. Gavin Newsom will have 30 days to either approve or deny the decision. Only then, if Newsom does approve their parole, would the Menendez brothers be released from prison.",
      "What happens if the Menendez brothers are denied parole?",
      "If the Menendez brothers are denied parole during their hearings, they could attempt to gain freedom in future hearings.",
      "According to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, if an inmate is denied parole, state law requires the board to schedule another hearing three, five, seven, 10 or 15 years in the future. An inmate can submit a petition to advance the next hearing date based on new circumstances or information.",
      "In 2024, the board held 3,764 hearings, according to the CDCR. Of those hearings, 69% were denied compared to the 31% who were granted parole.",
      "What is California Gov. Gavin Newsom's role in the Menendez brothers' parole bid?",
      "Regardless of what the parole board decides, Newsom will have the final say whether he approves or denies its recommendation.",
      "According to the CDCR, under the state constitution, the governor has the \"executive authority to affirm, reverse, or modify any Board decision to grant or deny parole to a convicted murderer.\"",
      "Thus far, Newsom has remained guarded about the brothers' release, saying he will take the parole board's decision into consideration when making his.",
      "In 2022, Newsom rejected two notable parole recommendations for Sirhan Sirhan, whose death sentence for the 1968 assassination of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was commuted to life imprisonment in 1972, and former\u00a0Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, who was convicted of murder for her role in the 1969 killings of Rosemary and Leno LaBianca in their Los Angeles home.",

      "But in a ruling late Wednesday, the court declined to act, writing that the Republican state lawmakers who filed the suit had \"failed to meet their burden of establishing a basis for relief at this time.\"",
      "The California legislature is set to vote on the redistricting plan on Thursday, which would send the bill to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's desk for approval.",
      "Democratic state lawmakers in California introduced a set of bills to create new district boundaries in a way they hope would flip five congressional seats, a move made in response to President Trump and Texas Republicans' push to reshape five congressional districts in Texas to favor the GOP. Democratic state lawmakers in California, who have a supermajority in the legislature, want to pass the bills immediately so they can place the proposal in front of voters in a Nov. 4 special election",
      "Democrats' proposal in California would try to flip five of the state's nine districts currently held by Republicans and make them more friendly for Democrats. California has 52 congressional districts. The changes may require an amendment to California's state Constitution to override the independent commission that's currently responsible for the state's redistricting process.",
      "The battle over district lines may influence the midterm elections next year. Republicans hold only a slim majority in the House of Representatives, and they want to hold onto it, while Democrats are aiming to take back the House.",
      "Newsom, a potential 2028 contender, has been leading the charge.",
      "\"Look, what we're doing neuters, neutralizes what's happening in Texas,\" Newsom told reporters Wednesday. \"People have this chance with this ballot \u2014 Nov. 4 \u2014 is stand up to the rule of law, stand up for coequal branches of government, stand up to, yes,\u00a0 Donald Trump, but also stand up in the spirit that defines this moment to people being bullied and people being intimidated.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the GOP state lawmakers who sued over the redistricting plan said the Supreme Court's ruling is \"not the end of this fight.\"",
      "\"We will continue to challenge this unconstitutional power grab in the courts and at the ballot box. Californians deserve fair, transparent elections, not secret backroom deals to protect politicians,\" the statement read.",
      "The state Assembly and Senate's appropriations committees advanced the redrawn maps on Wednesday, following hearings in which both parties squared off over the redistricting plan.",
      "\"I want to note for the record that we do not have all the fiscal information that we need to make this decision,\" state Sen. Kelly Seyarto, a Republican, said during a hearing. \"And we're going to do it anyway.\"",
      "Democratic lawmakers are blaming President Trump for their decision to redraw the maps.",
      "\"This started because Donald Trump went to Texas and directed Texas to engage in mid-decade redistricting,\" Sen. Scott Weiner of San Francisco told CBS News Sacramento.",
      "Democratic strategist Steve Maviglio says California Democratic lawmakers will try to keep their messaging aimed at Mr. Trump and away from the redrawn district lines.",
      "\"This will be a vote against Donald Trump,\" Maviglio said. \"They don't want to talk about maps. Maps and redistricting are mind-numbing questions that voters don't understand, so it's much simpler, do the math, mobilize the Democrats in the state to make this all about Donald Trump. And talk about how awful he's been to the state and to say, 'A yes vote will try to stop him in his track.'\"",

      "A lower court last month blocked the Department of Homeland Security from ending Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for the three countries until at least mid-November to give the court more time to weigh the issue. The judge sided with plaintiffs who argued the Trump administration's plan to wind down TPS was \"motivated by racial animus.\"",
      "But on Wednesday, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit put that ruling on hold pending appeal. The order \u2014 which was issued by a panel of three judges nominated under the Clinton, Bush and first Trump administrations \u2014 did not offer a rationale for the decision.",

      "If they don't have any other means to stay in the U.S. legally \u2014 like a green card or an asylum application \u2014 those who lose their TPS are no longer eligible to work in the country lawfully and are at risk of deportation.",
      "Prior to last month's ruling, the Trump administration sought to end TPS for Nepal on Aug. 5, and for Nicaragua and Honduras in early September.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California \u2014 one of the organizations that sued the administration over the TPS decision \u2014 called Wednesday's ruling \"devastating.\"",
      "\"I am heartbroken by the court's decision,\" Sandhya Lama, one of the plaintiffs in the case, said in a statement released by the ACLU. \"I've lived in the U.S. for years, and my kids are U.S. citizens and have never even been to Nepal.

      "DHS called the ruling a \"significant legal victory\" in a statement.",
      "\"Temporary Protected Status was always meant to be just that: Temporary,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said. \"TPS was never meant to be a de facto asylum system, yet that is how previous administrations have used it for decades while allowing hundreds of thousands of foreigners into the country without proper vetting.\"",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has sought to wind down TPS for hundreds of thousands of migrants from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Haiti, Venezuela and other countries, arguing their protections have been in place for too long or that conditions in those nations have improved enough to allow their nationals to return.",
      "The Trump administration, for example, has noted that the TPS programs for Honduras and Nicaragua were first created in 1999, after Hurricane Mitch caused catastrophic floods and killed thousands in Central America. The TPS program for Nepal was announced in 2015, after an earthquake hit the small Asian country. DHS Secretary Kristi Noem has said all three countries have recovered from those environmental disasters.",
      "But San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge Trina Thompson said last month the TPS holders who sued Noem were likely to succeed in arguing that her decisions were \"preordained\" actions that did not fully consider lingering conditions in Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua.",

    "summary": "President Trump called on Fed Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his appointees accused her of mortgage fraud.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University. She has also served on the faculty of Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government and worked as a senior economist on the Council of Economic Advisers under President Obama.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge in New York on Wednesday declined the Justice Department's request to unseal grand jury material in the case of late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, saying prosecutors had failed to demonstrate that \"special circumstances\" warranted the disclosure.",
      "Judge Richard Berman of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York issued his ruling in a 14-page decision denying the government's motion to unseal the documents.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material in question includes the testimony of just a single witness, an FBI agent \"who had no direct knowledge of the facts of the case and whose testimony was mostly hearsay.\" The documents the government was seeking to unseal included roughly 70 pages of transcripts of the agent's two presentations to the grand jury, a PowerPoint exhibit and a call log.",
      "Berman noted that the Justice Department's files on Epstein dwarf those stemming from the grand jury. Proceedings before grand juries are typically kept secret.",
      "\"A significant and compelling reason to reject the Government's position in this litigation is that the Government has already undertaken a comprehensive investigation into the Epstein case and, not surprisingly, has assembled a 'trove' of Epstein documents, interviews, and exhibits. And, the Government committed that it would share its Epstein investigation materials with the public,\" Berman wrote.",
      "\"The Government is the logical party to make comprehensive disclosure to the public of the Epstein Files. By comparison, the instant grand jury motion appears to be a 'diversion' from the breadth and scope of the Epstein files in the Government's possession,\" Berman wrote, quoting a decision by another judge in New York who\u00a0denied the government's move to unseal material in the case of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's co-conspirator who is serving a 20-year sentence on sex-trafficking charges.",
      "\"The information contained in the Epstein grand jury transcripts pales in comparison to the Epstein investigation information and materials in the hands of the Department of Justice,\" he concluded.",
      "Berman wrote that the grand jury material is \"merely a hearsay snippet of Jeffrey Epstein's alleged conduct.\" He cited \"possible threats to victims' safety and privacy\" as one of the factors that weighed in favor of not releasing the documents.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment on Berman's ruling.",
      "The family of Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's most well-known accusers, who died by suicide earlier this year, said in a statement, \"We applaud Judge Richard Berman's decision not to release the grand jury testimony in the Ghislaine Maxwell case. We wholeheartedly agree with his assessment that the Department of Justice (DOJ) is creating a diversion with its actions regarding the grand jury motion, which distracts from the vast scope of the Epstein files in the government's possession.\"",
      "\"We recognize the critical importance of protecting survivors; it is essential that we redact any information that could jeopardize their safety or privacy. Their well-being must always be our priority,\" the family said. \"At the same time, we demand accountability for all individuals implicated in these heinous acts. Those responsible must be held to the fullest extent of the law. We will not accept anything less than justice for Virginia and all survivors.\"",
      "In July, the Justice Department asked the judges overseeing the Maxwell and Epstein cases to release the grand jury material that formed the basis for the federal charges against them, a move that came amid uproar over the department's review of the so-called \"Epstein files\" and decision not to release additional documents in the government's possession.",
      "Epstein was investigated by federal authorities in Florida in the 2000s, a probe that ended in a non-prosecution agreement and a guilty plea on state prostitution charges. He was arrested again on federal sex trafficking charges in 2019 and died in a Manhattan jail weeks later. Several investigations determined he died by suicide.",
      "There has been increasing pressure on the Trump administration from Democrats and many Republicans to disclose more information about the Epstein case. The Justice Department issued findings of a review of the Epstein investigation in July, saying it had found no evidence of a \"client list\" or indication that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures, an announcement that spurred more questions from skeptics.",
      "Republicans in Congress have pushed for more transparency since the Justice Department's review. The House Oversight Committee issued a subpoena to the department for documents related to Epstein earlier this month. The committee said Tuesday that it expects to receive documents later this week, and intends to begin releasing them pending a review to redact victims' information.",

      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard is slashing her office's staff by around 40% \u2014 the latest major Trump-era change slated for the intelligence agency.",
      "The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, or ODNI, is planning on cutting its headcount to around 1,300 employees, down from approximately 2,000 in February and 1,500 as of mid-August, according to a senior ODNI official.",
      "The cuts at ODNI are expected to save around $700 million annually, Gabbard's office estimated in a\u00a0statement. The total budget for all U.S. intelligence agencies exceeded $100 billion last year.",
      "Gabbard said ODNI \"has become bloated and inefficient, and the intelligence community is rife with abuse of power.\"",
      "In a fact sheet on the changes \u2014 dubbed \"ODNI 2.0\" \u2014 the agency said several departments it argued were redundant would be refocused. Those include the National Counterproliferation and Biosecurity Center, which monitors for weapons of mass destruction; the Foreign Malign Influence Center, which describes its mission as \"mitigating threats to democracy\"; and the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center, which handles cybersecurity.",
      "The agency is also planning on shutting down the National Intelligence University, merging it with the Pentagon's National Defense University. And it will shutter the External Research Council and Strategic Futures Group, which ODNI accused of partisanship.",
      "ODNI was created in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, which investigators say was preceded by a lack of communication between U.S. intelligence agencies. Its duties include overseeing the dozens of agencies that make up the intelligence community and advising the president on intelligence matters. Since ODNI's founding around 20 years ago, some members of both parties have supported changes to the agency.",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, hailed Gabbard's restructuring plans. Earlier this year, Cotton introduced a bill that would cap the number of full-time ODNI employees at 650.",
      "\"Congress created the ODNI to be a lean organization that used small staffs to coordinate across the Intelligence Community and execute specific, important tasks. Today's announcement is an important step towards returning ODNI to that original size, scope, and mission,\" Cotton said in a statement.",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, criticized Gabbard's moves in a statement. He pointed to \"broad, bipartisan agreement that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence is in need of thoughtful reform.\"",
      "\"But given Director Gabbard's track record of politicizing intelligence \u2013 including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials \u2013 I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,\" said Warner, in reference to Gabbard's\u00a0announcement Tuesday revoking\u00a0the security clearances for dozens of current and former government officials, accusing them of \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence.\"",
      "Since she was confirmed as ODNI's leader in February, Gabbard has railed against what she views as politicization of intelligence \u2014 drawing pushback from Democratic critics. In some cases, she has reignited years-old political battles over Russian interference in the 2016 election, releasing documents that she argues call into question the government's findings that Russia attempted to boost President Trump's campaign.",
      "Last month, she declassified documents dating back to 2016 and accused Obama administration officials of engaging in a \"years-long coup\" against Mr. Trump \u2014 suggesting there could be \"criminal implications.\"",

    "title": "4 reasons why the Trump tariffs haven't caused U.S. inflation to soar",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Wed, 20 Aug 2025 17:06:55 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often trying to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year could would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem says the entire southern border wall with Mexico is being painted black to deter illegal immigration, at President Trump's request.",
    "story": [
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Tuesday that the entire wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is going to be painted black to make it hotter and deter illegal immigration \u2014 an idea she said was \"specifically at the request\" of President Trump.",
      "Noem spoke during a visit to a portion of the wall in New Mexico, where she also picked up a roller brush to help out with the painting.",
      "She touted the height of the wall as well as its depth as ways to deter people seeking to go over or under the walls. And Noem said Homeland Security was going to be trying black paint to make the metal hotter.",
      "\"That is specifically at the request of the president, who understands that in the hot temperatures down here when something is painted black it gets even warmer and it will make it even harder for people to climb. So we are going to be painting the entire southern border wall black to make sure that we encourage individuals to not come into our country illegally,\" Noem said.",
      "U.S. Border Patrol Chief Mike Banks, who attended the event with Noem, said the paint would also help deter rust.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, building the wall was a central focus of his hardline immigration policy, though construction on the wall faced some legal and logistical delays. During his second term, his mass deportation agenda with arrests in the interior of the country has been the main focus, but Homeland Security will be getting about $46 billion to complete the wall as part of new funding passed by Congress in the Trump-backed \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" this summer.",
      "The Trump administration has sought to fortify the southern border in other ways, too. Thousands of military personnel have been sent to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Mr. Trump has authorized the military to take control of narrow strips of public land along the border. Crossing into those territories is considered entering a military base, allowing them to be detained by both Border Patrol and the Defense Department, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said earlier this year.",
      "Noem said the federal government has been building about a half mile of barrier every day.",
      "\"The border wall will look very different based on the topography and the geography of where it is built,\" she said.",
      "She said that in addition to barriers like the one she visited Tuesday, the department is also working on \"water-borne infrastructure.\" Long sections of the roughly 2,000-mile border between the U.S. and Mexico sit along the Rio Grande River in Texas.",
      "The Trump administration is pushing forward with completing the wall at the same time that the number of people crossing the border illegally has plummeted. In the month of June, just over 6,000 migrants were apprehended along the southern border, a decades-long low \u2014 and a steep dropoff from the Biden administration, when border arrests peaked at upwards of 6,000 per day.",

    "summary": "Some packages of Great Value frozen shrimp sold at Walmart are at risk for potential for Cesium-137 contamination, the FDA says.",
    "story": [
      "Walmart said it is recalling some frozen shrimp after the Food and Drug Administration warned that the seafood items, sold under the Great Value label, are at risk of radioactive contamination and shouldn't be consumed.",
      "The frozen shrimp were imported from Indonesian company PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati and sold at Walmart stores as Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, the FDA said on Tuesday. The agency noted it has recommended that Walmart recall the product.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have issued a sales restriction and removed this product from our impacted stores. We are working with the supplier to investigate,\" Walmart said in an email to CBS News.",
      "The company added that consumers who bought the shrimp shouldn't eat it and should throw it out. Customers can contact the store where they purchased the product for a full refund, it added.",
      "The shrimp could be contaminated with a radioactive isotope called Cesium-137, although the FDA said that no products as of yet have tested positive for it. The agency said it issued the warning about Walmart's Great Value shrimp after it had detected Cesium-137 in a single shipment of frozen shrimp from PT. Bahari Makmur Sejati.",
      "That shipment \"did not enter U.S. commerce,\" the FDA said.",
      "Here's what to know about the warning.",
      "Which shrimp products are part of the FDA warning?",
      "The FDA said that consumers \"should not eat or serve certain lots of Great Value raw frozen shrimp from Walmart.\"",
      "The lots are:",
      "Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005540-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027\u00a0Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005538-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027\u00a0Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005539-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027.",

      "Great Value brand frozen raw shrimp, lot code: 8005539-1, Best by Date: 3/15/2027.",
      "What should you do if you bought the shrimp?",
      "Consumers who bought the shrimp cited in the FDA's notice should throw it away, the agency said.",
      "\"Distributors and retailers should dispose of this product and should not sell or serve this product,\" the FDA added.",
      "What is Cesium-137?",
      "Cesium-137, or Cs-137, is the radioactive form of the element cesium, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Produced by nuclear fission, it's used in medical devices and is also a byproduct of nuclear fission in nuclear reactors and weapons testing, the EPA notes.",
      "How dangerous is the potential Cesium-137 contamination?",
      "The Cesium-137 detected in the imported shrimp was about 68 Bq/kg, which the FDA said sits below its threshold of 1200 Bq/kg for \"levels of concern\" for imported foods.",
      "\"At this level, the product would not pose an acute hazard to consumers,\" the FDA said in its warning notice.",
      "However, the FDA noted that repeated low-dose exposure to Cesium-137 carries an \"elevated risk of cancer, resulting from damage to DNA within living cells of the body.\"",
      "It added, \"Avoiding products like the shipment FDA tested with similar levels of Cs-137 is a measure intended to reduce exposure to low-level radiation that could have health impacts with continued exposure over a long period of time.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hurricane-erin-track-path/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:23:01 -0400",
    "summary": "Meteorologists are closely tracking the projected path and forecast of Hurricane Erin, which is the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year.",
    "story": [
      "Hurricane Erin was beginning to move away from the North Carolina coast early Thursday after bringing tropical storm conditions to the state's Outer Banks, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said as it cautioned people not to swim at most U.S. East Coast beaches due to \"life-threatening surf and rip currents.\"",
      "Erin\u00a0isn't expected to make landfall in the U.S., but storm surge warnings\u00a0remain in place for parts of North Carolina and parts of the Outer Banks are under evacuation orders. North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein\u00a0declared a state of emergency\u00a0in the state.",
      "\"This is a life-threatening situation,\" the Miami-based National Hurricane Center said in its 8 a.m. update Thursday. \"Persons located within these areas should take all necessary actions to protect life and property from rising water and the potential for other dangerous conditions.\"",
      "Meanwhile, a tropical storm warning is in effect for a swath of the North Carolina and Virginia coastline.",
      "What category is Hurricane Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, was a Category 2 storm early Thursday as it churned over the Atlantic off the southeast U.S. coast.",
      "It exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday before being downgraded, and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "As of 8 a.m. Thursday, Erin had maximum sustained winds of 105 mph and was moving north-northeast at 17 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm's center was about 210 miles east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina and 440 miles west-northwest of Bermuda.",
      "The hurricane center said \"gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days\" and \"Erin is expected to become post-tropical by Saturday.\"",
      "A\u00a0Category 2 hurricane\u00a0is defined as having maximum sustained winds from 96 mph to 110 mph. Erin was just under what's considered a major storm, capable of causing devastating damage with maximum sustained winds of at least 111 mph.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "The center of the storm was expected to move over the western Atlantic between the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda through early Friday, then pass south of Atlantic Canada on Friday and Saturday, the hurricane center said.",
      "Erin is a \"large and growing\" storm, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 105 miles from the center and tropical storm-force winds extending up to 320 miles from the center, forecasters said.",
      "Tropical storm warnings were in effect from Beaufort Inlet, North Carolina, to Chincoteague, Virginia, including Pamlico and Albemarle sounds. A tropical storm watch was posted for Bermuda. A tropical storm warning means tropical storm conditions are expected somewhere within the warning area, while a watch means they are possible.",
      "A storm surge warning was also issued for the Outer Banks, meaning there was a danger of life-threatening inundation from coastal flooding.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of the forecast models shows the storm skirting the Caribbean islands and remaining well offshore of the U.S. East Coast as it moves north and curves back over the Atlantic.",
      "A high-pressure system in the Atlantic was expected to steer Erin away from the U.S. coast while a cold front was also forecast to push the hurricane offshore, CBS News Bay Area meteorologist Jessica Burch reported.",
      "When is Hurricane Erin expected to impact the U.S.?",
      "Erin isn't forecast to hit the U.S. directly, though tropical storm conditions were hitting parts of the Outer Banks early Thursday.",
      "Forecasters warned of dangerous storm surge combining with high tide could flood areas with as much as 2 feet to 4 feet of water. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the expected flooding.",
      "Rough ocean conditions were also expected to cause life-threatening surf and rip currents. Hatteras and Ocracoke islands were vulnerable to waves of 15 feet to 20 feet, forecasters said. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina.",
      "Mike Brennan, the hurricane center's director, said the dangerous conditions were expected to last for much of the week across almost the entire East Coast. He urged people to heed any warnings from local officials.",
      "\"It's just not going to be a very safe environment to be in the ocean,\" Brennan said.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "In addition to the warnings along the North Carolina coast, some beaches ranging from South Florida up to New England are also taking precautions.",
      "Erin is expected to bring dangerous rip currents along the Jersey Shore and south-facing New York beaches,\u00a0CBS News New York reported, with the risk continuing through the week. Officials at some New Jersey beaches and the popular summer destination of Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, prohibited swimming as a precaution, and more closures may follow.",
      "\"You're allowed on the beach, but you will not be allowed in the water because we have treacherous conditions going on right now,\" said Ed Schneider, beach patrol captain in Wildwood, New Jersey, told CBS News Philadelphia. \"We have a rip current warning, we have [a] rough surf warning, we have [a] storm warning, and conditions are bad.\"",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0last week west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "A Defense Department official confirmed to The Associated Press that the military assets had been assigned to the region in support of counter narcotics efforts. The official, who was not authorized to comment about military planning, said the vessels would be deployed \"over the course of several months.\"",
      "The deployment of U.S. destroyers and personnel comes as Mr. Trump pushes for using the U.S. military to thwart cartels he blames for the flow of fentanyl and other illicit drugs into American communities, and for perpetuating violence in some U.S. cities.",
      "Mr. Trump has also pressed Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to cooperate more on security than her predecessor, specifically by more aggressively pursuing Mexico's cartels. But she has drawn a clear line when it comes to Mexico's sovereignty, rejecting suggestions by Mr. Trump and others of any intervention by the U.S. military.",
      "Mr. Trump in February designated Venezuela's Tren de Aragua, MS-13 in El Salvador and six groups based in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations. His Republican administration has also stepped up immigration enforcement against alleged gang members.",
      "The terror designation is normally reserved for groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS, which use violence for political ends \u2014 not for money-focused crime rings such as the Latin American cartels.",
      "But the Trump administration argues the international connections and operations of the groups \u2014 including drug trafficking, migrant smuggling and violent pushes to extend their territory \u2014 warrant the designation.",
      "Earlier this month, the Trump government announced it was doubling to $50 million a reward for the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, accusing him of being one of the world's largest narco-traffickers and working with cartels to flood the U.S. with fentanyl-laced cocaine.",

      "\"Washington's accusing Venezuela of drug trafficking reveals its lack of credibility and the failure of its policies in the region,\" Gil said. \"While Washington threatens, Venezuela steadily advances in peace and sovereignty, demonstrating that true effectiveness against crime is achieved by respecting the independence of its peoples. Every aggressive statement confirms the inability of imperialism to subdue a free and sovereign people.\"",
      "The statement was followed by the government's decision to temporarily ban the purchase, sale and operation of drones in Venezuela's airspace. In 2018, drones armed with explosives detonated near Maduro in an apparent assassination attempt while he was delivering a speech to hundreds of soldiers being broadcast live on television.",

      "Ukrainian officials said the Russian attack hit energy infrastructure, private homes, an American electronics factory \u2014 where President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the 15 injuries were sustained, and a kindergarten.",
      "\"Last night, the Russian army set one of its insane anti-records.

As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",
      "\"A response is needed,\" he added. \"So far, there has been no signal from Moscow that they are really going to engage in meaningful negotiations and end this war. Pressure is needed. Strong sanctions, strong tariffs.\"",
      "There has been a lot of talk \u2014   outside of Ukraine \u2014 about a peace deal amid Mr. Trump's ramped-up diplomacy. But inside Ukraine, people continue to live and die in a war zone more than three years after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. Many in the country, like their president, simply don't believe that Putin really wants to end the war. They think he's just playing along with the ceasefire narrative to avoid angering Mr. Trump.",

      "Three of those arrested allegedly were directly involved in the killings and the others had roles in the logistics.",
      "\"In memory of our colleagues and out of respect for their families and friends, this government will not rest until the truth is known and justice is served,\" the mayor said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "Brugada's personal secretary, Ximena Guzm\u00e1n, and an adviser, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, were shot dead in Guzm\u00e1n's car on a Mexico City street in broad daylight on May 20. Guzm\u00e1n, as she did regularly, was picking up Mu\u00f1oz at a subway station.",
      "Authorities said the gunman had fled on a motorcycle that was hidden nearby and then changed vehicles twice as he and others fled into neighboring Mexico State.",
      "\"These results represent the first advances of an ongoing investigation,\" Brugada said.",
      "Bertha Mar\u00eda Alcalde Luj\u00e1n, Mexico City's chief prosecutor, said later during a news conference that five vehicles, including the motorcycle the shooter fled on, were part of the operation. Two of the other vehicles were identified as having surveilled the victims in the weeks before their killings.",
      "Alcalde Luj\u00e1n even said investigators believe the hit had originally been planned for May 14, but Guzm\u00e1n didn't pick up Mu\u00f1oz that day, so they believe it was called off.",
      "Mexico's federal security chief, Omar Garc\u00eda Harfuch, said investigators confirmed that those involved in the shootings initially fled to a neighborhood in the borough of Iztacalco, not far from the capital's international airport. There they changed vehicles and escaped the city to neighboring Mexico state.",
      "Early Wednesday, law enforcement carried out 11 raids, arresting the 13 suspects.",
      "Mexico City Police Chief Pablo V\u00e1zquez Camacho said there were various lines of investigation, but authorities would not speak of a possible motive while the investigation remained open.",

    "published": "Wed, 20 Aug 2025 15:34:00 -0400",
    "summary": "A new study warns that irreversible changes happening in Antarctica, which are caused by climate change, could cause global oceans to rise by meters.",
    "story": [
      "Abrupt and potentially irreversible changes in Antarctica driven by climate change could lift global oceans by meters and lead to \"catastrophic consequences for generations,\" scientists warned Wednesday.",
      "More broadly, a state-of-knowledge review by a score of top experts revealed accelerating shifts across the region that are often both a cause and effect of global warming, according to a study published in Nature, a peer-reviewed international scientific journal.",
      "The study's authors suggest that limiting\u00a0CO2 emissions, and in turn preventing global warming from exceeding at least 1.5 degrees Celsius, \"will be imperative\" to reduce and prepare for the broad effects of abrupt Antarctic and Southern Ocean changes.",
      "\"Antarctica is showing worrying signs of rapid change across its ice, ocean and ecosystems,\" lead author and Australian National University professor Nerilie Abram told the Agence France-Presse. \"Some of these abrupt changes will be difficult to stop.\"",
      "Shifts in different facets of Antarctica's climate system amplify each other and have accelerated the pace of warming globally as well, Abram said.",
      "The study looked at evidence of abrupt change \u2014 or \"regime shifts\" \u2014 in sea ice, regional ocean currents, the continent's ice sheet and ice shelves, and marine life. It also examined how they interact.",
      "Floating sea ice does not significantly add to sea level when it melts, but its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the sun's energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead.",
      "Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.",
      "Retreating sea ice",
      "After increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade.",
      "Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometers, or roughly 75 miles, from the continent's shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.",
      "By July 2025, daily sea ice extent in both hemispheres was at its third lowest in the 47-year satellite record, according to the\u00a0National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado Boulder.",
      "Data from NASA, released in 2020, indicated that Antarctica and Greenland had lost thousands of gigatons of ice between 2003 and 2019, indirectly contributing to more than half an inch of overall sea level rise around the world.",
      "Last September, scientists warned that the Antarctic Ice Sheet, officially called the Thwaites Glacier, would deteriorate \"further and faster,\" with the increased melting expected to trigger rising sea levels. Research conducted by the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, a collective of more than 100 scientists, found that the volume of water flowing into the sea from the Thwaites glacier and others nearby had doubled from the 1990s to the 2010s.",
      "The \"overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice\" means that, on current trends, Antarctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the recent study published Wednesday in Nature found.",
      "This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction, experts warned.",
      "Over the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.",
      "Of five sites monitored in the Bellingshausen Sea region in 2023, all but one experienced a 100% loss of chicks, earlier research reported.",
      "Unlike sea ice, ice sheets and the ice shelves to which they are connected are on \u2014 or supported by \u2014 land.",
      "The world would need to heat up by 5 degrees Celsius compared with pre-industrial levels to melt the entire Antarctic ice sheet, which would lift global oceans an almost unimaginable 58 meters, or nearly 200 feet.",
      "Point of no return",
      "Global warming to date \u2014 on average about 1.3 degrees Celsius \u2014 is fast approaching a threshold that would cause part of the ice sheet to generate at least three meters of sea level rise, flooding coastal areas inhabited today by hundreds of millions, the study said.",
      "\"Unstoppable collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is one of the most concerning global tipping points,\" said Abram.",
      "\"The evidence points to this being triggered at global warming well below 2\u00b0C.\"",
      "Another potential risk is the collapse of the Antarctic Overturning Circulation, a system of ocean currents that distribute heat and nutrients within the the region and globally.",
      "A \"rapid and substantial slowdown\" of the currents has already begun, and evidence from the previous interglacial period \u2014 between two ice ages \u2014 before our own, 125,000 years ago, points to an abrupt stagnation of the system under conditions similar to those seen today.",
      "\"This would lead to widespread climate and ecosystem impacts,\" ranging from an intensification of global warming to a decrease in the ocean's capacity to absorb CO2, the study reported.",
      "Ultimately, the only way to slow down the interlocking changes is to stop adding more planet-warming gases into the atmosphere.",
      "\"The greenhouse gas emission decisions that we make over the coming decade or two will lock in how much ice we will lose and how quickly it will be lost,\" Abram said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump is working to coordinate a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, which would be the first face-to-face interaction between the two leaders since Russia invaded Ukraine more than three years ago.",
      "Asked about arranging the meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Trump said on Fox & Friends that he would let Putin and Zelenskyy meet first before getting involved himself, saying \"they haven't been exactly best friends.\"",
      "\"I hope President Putin is going to be good, and if he's not, that's going to be a rough situation,\" Mr. Trump said. He noted that he's hopeful Zelenskyy will \"do what he has to do,\" saying he has to \"show some flexibility also.\"",
      "Budapest, Hungary, is among the locations being considered for possible meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, a source with knowledge of the planning told CBS News. Hungary has \"expressed its openness and willingness to host the talks,\" as have a handful of other countries, the source said. Politico first reported that Budapest was under consideration to host the talks.",
      "The White House hopes to settle on a date and location for the meeting by the end of this week. German Chancellor Merz said Monday that the goal is for the meeting to take place within the next two weeks.",
      "Mr. Trump told talk radio host Mark Levin on Tuesday that he's aiming for direct Putin-Zelenskyy talks because he believes it would be better for the two leaders to start by meeting one-on-one, \"just to see\" what happens. After that, the U.S. president said he will meet with the Ukrainian and Russian leaders to \"get it closed\" if necessary, which he noted it \"probably will be.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's efforts come one day after an extraordinary series of meetings at the White House between the U.S. president, Zelenskyy and European leaders. In a display of unity, Zelenskyy and the European leaders stressed the importance of security guarantees in a peace deal, which Mr. Trump said could come with U.S. coordination. He said Tuesday that no U.S. troops would be on the ground as part of a security guarantee, but has left the door open to U.S. air support.",
      "Attention has now turned to a possible summit between Putin and Zelenskyy. After Monday's meetings, Mr. Trump said he placed a call to Putin to set up the meeting, and he \"picked it up very happily,\" despite the late hour in Russia. Mr. Trump called it a \"very good call.\"",
      "\"I told him that we're going to set up a meeting with President Zelenskyy, and you and he will meet, and then after that meeting, if everything works out OK, I'll meet and we'll wrap it up,\" Mr. Trump said. He added that it takes \"two to tango,\" and that \"they have to have somewhat of a relationship, otherwise, we're just wasting a lot of time.\"",
      "It is still unclear whether the bilateral meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy would be immediately followed by trilateral talks in the same location, or if Mr. Trump would make arrangements to participate in trilateral talks in a different city on another date after Putin and Zelenskyy have met.",
      "Zelenskyy told CBS News shortly after leaving the White House that a date had not been set to meet with Putin. In a post on X Tuesday, Zelenskyy called the talks in Washington \"truly a significant step toward ending the war and ensuring the security of Ukraine and our people.\"",
      "\"We are already working on the concrete content of the security guarantees,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Today, we continue coordination at the level of leaders. There will be discussions, and we are preparing the relevant formats.\"",
      "A Russian spokesperson would only say that high-level talks would take place, but would not confirm that Putin would be involved.",
      "Mr. Trump, who met with Putin in Alaska last week, expressed urgency around the timing of the next meeting, suggesting that waiting too long would result in thousands of deaths. In what appeared to be a hot mic moment Monday, Mr. Trump told French President Emmanuel Macron that Putin \"wants to make a deal for me.\"",
      "The president outlined on Fox that he has been surprised that Zelenskyy and Putin are \"getting along a little bit better than I thought,\" adding that \"they're the ones that have to call the shots.\"",
      "\"We're going to find out about President Putin in the next couple of weeks, that I can tell you, and we're going to see where it all goes,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's possible that he doesn't want to make a deal.\"",
      "At the White House press briefing, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Putin and Zelenskyy have \"expressed a willingness to sit down with each other,\" and that \"accommodations for that meeting are underway.\"",
      "Meanwhile, security guarantees for Ukraine emerged as a key issue during Monday's meetings, with Zelenskyy calling them a \"starting point towards ending the war.\"",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Monday that the U.S. will work with European and other allies to provide security guarantees for Ukraine after the war, although he did not provide specifics. And Macron said discussions on what the U.S. is willing to provide could begin as soon as Tuesday.",
      "On the security guarantees, Mr. Trump said the European leaders are \"willing to put people on the ground,\" and that \"we're willing to help them with things, especially, probably if you could talk about by air because there's nobody has the kind of stuff we have.\" But the president added that \"I don't think it's going to be a problem.\"",
      "\"There will be some form of security,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It can't be NATO, because that was a \u2014 that's just not something that would ever, ever happen.\"",
      "Leavitt outlined Mr. Trump's position Tuesday afternoon, saying \"the president has definitely stated U.S. boots will not be on the ground in Ukraine, but we can certainly help in the coordination and perhaps provide other means of security guarantees to our European allies.\"",
      "\"The president understands security guarantees are crucially important to secure a lasting peace and he has directed his national security team to coordinate with our friends in Europe,\" she added.",

      "Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and controls or claims about 20% of Ukraine's land.",

      "During the talks in the Oval Office on Monday, a map of Ukraine was displayed that showed areas of Ukrainian territory that are currently controlled by Russia or that are contested, with the estimated percentage of Russian control listed for each region, seen below.",
      "One area that Putin is believed to want Ukraine to give up as a condition for peace is the eastern Donbas region, which has seen some of the most intense fighting of the war. It is made up of two oblasts, or provinces, called Donetsk and Luhansk.",
      "Residents of this region are largely Russian-speaking and parts of the area have been controlled by Russian-backed separatists since a Russian-supported insurgency ramped up in 2014.",
      "At the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Putin recognized the independence of these separatist regions and was accused of using their protection as a pretext for Russia's invasion, making a televised address in which he claimed the self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk had appealed to Russia for help.",
      "Despite Russian forces then invading and holding portions of eastern Ukraine, through the course of the war they have failed to capture the region completely.",
      "Zelenskyy has rejected\u00a0surrendering Ukrainian territory to Russia, including in the Donbas region, as part of a ceasefire deal.",
      "And Ukraine's leader would not technically be allowed to cede any Ukrainian lands to Russia, as part of ceasefire negotiations or otherwise, because doing so could violate Ukraine's constitution, which specifically\u00a0outlines the territories of Ukraine.",
      "That also means Zelenskyy can't cede the territory of Crimea, which was invaded and annexed by Russia in 2014.",
      "Instead, some analysts have suggested that, to achieve a ceasefire agreement, a deal could be struck to essentially freeze the front line \u2014 which snakes roughly 620 miles from northeastern Ukraine to its southern coast on the Black Sea \u2014 without Ukraine officially giving away the land on the other side.",
      "Zelenskyy also has warned that ceding any of Ukraine's territory to Russia could benefit Russia in any future potential aggression toward Ukraine.",
      "Putin has clearly stated that he believes Ukraine is part of Russia politically, culturally and linguistically, and Ukraine fears a pause in the fighting without robust security guarantees from the U.S. or European allies would leave the door open for Putin to rebuild Russia's military capabilities and invade again.",
      "\"For the Russians, Donbas is a springboard for a future new offensive,\" Zelenskyy told reporters ahead of Mr. Trump's\u00a0meeting with Putin. \"If we leave Donbas of our own accord or under pressure, we will invite a third war.\"",
      "Meanwhile, as talks continue, Russia has continued its strikes on Ukraine. Ahead of Mr. Trump's meeting with Zelenskyy on Monday, Russian strikes hit multiple cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa and Sumy, according to local media.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News correspondent David Spunt has the latest on Kilmar Abrego Garcia's trial on 'Special Report.'",
      "Lawyers for Salvadoran migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia asked a federal judge in Nashville on Tuesday to dismiss a criminal case against him, arguing in a filing that the indictment handed down by the Trump administration amounts to a \"vindictive\" and selective prosecution.",
      "The 35-page filing was submitted Tuesday to U.S. District Judge Waverly Crenshaw in the Middle District of Tennessee. It comes just two days before Abrego Garcia is slated to be released Friday from federal custody, where he was detained on human smuggling charges in May, immediately after being returned to the U.S. from El Salvador at the end of a months-long court fight.",
      "Both Crenshaw and U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes had determined that Abrego Garcia was eligible to be released from criminal custody pending trial, though Holmes agreed to stay his release for 30 days, at the request of Abrego Garcia's attorneys, who cited fears that he would be detained and immediately deported.",
      "Crenshaw, for his part, said in a 37-page ruling that the Justice Department \"fails to provide any evidence that there is something in Abrego\u2019s history, or his exhibited characteristics, that warrants detention.\"",

Bondi at the time said it was \"up to El Salvador\" whether Abrego would be returned to the U.S. (Win McNamee/Getty Images)",
      "He also poured cold water on the government's repeated allegations that Abrego Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a notion he described as \"fanciful.\"",
      "It's unclear whether Crenshaw will intervene and grant the motion to dismiss, filed late Tuesday.",
      "But it comes as Abrego Garcia\u2019s case has remained at the center of a months-long legal maelstrom, one that critics argue has allowed the Trump administration to test its mettle on immigration enforcement and its ability to slow-walk or evade compliance with federal courts.",
      "The request by Abrego Garcia's attorneys focuses squarely on the criminal indictment and investigation brought in the Middle District of Tennessee, which stems from a 2022 traffic stop in the state.",
      "His lawyers argued Tuesday that the timeline of the investigation and the incitement show the \"extreme lengths\" the administration has gone to in order to \"make a criminal case\" against their client.",
      "But Abrego Garcia's case is deeply complicated, involving dueling, but inextricably intertwined civil and criminal cases that have played out over roughly six months in separate federal courts, across two continents, and in dozens of status hearings before various judges.",
      "Any next steps in the case will therefore be fraught with political backlash.",
      "Already, Friday will bring to a fore key deadlines in both the civil and criminal cases involving Abrego Garcia: His expected release from U.S. custody in Nashville at the end of a 30-day stay, will set into motion the restrictions on his removal that were imposed in a separate court order handed down by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Maryland last month.",
      "That order requires him to \u00a0be transferred from Nashville to the nearest ICE detention facility in Maryland. Lawyers told the court they plan to escort him via private security, amid concerns about compliance from the Trump administration, as his family's lawyers acknowledged to Fox News Digital in an interview last month.",
      "ICE officials are also required to give Abrego Garcia 72 hours notice of the country of removal before they begin deportation proceedings, Xinis said in her order.",

      "Abrego Garcia's case has prompted the firing or resignation of at least three government officials at DHS and the Justice Department, including the abrupt resignation of Ben Schrader, a former federal prosecutor and former chief of the criminal division for the U.S. Middle District of Tennessee.",
      "Schrader resigned from his position at DOJ on the same day that the Justice Department secured the indictment against Abrego Garcia.",
      "His lawyers used the \u2018Hail Mary\u2019 court filing this week to spell out, in careful detail, the timeline of the civil lawsuit and the Justice Department's criminal investigation into Abrego Garcia, which kicked off while he was still detained in El Salvador, they noted.",
      "\"Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been singled out by the United States government,\" his lawyers said Tuesday. \"It is obvious why.\"",
      "The new filing recounts, in extemporaneous detail, the history of the Trump administration's actions in Abrego Garcia's nearly six-month legal saga, which has spanned two continents and multiple federal courts \u2014 making his case among the most high-profile immigration battles to date in Trump's second term.",
      "In the motion to dismiss, lawyers for Abrego Garcia ticked through the timeline of his removal from the U.S. in March, in Trump's first wave of deportation flights to El Salvador, as well as his eventual return months later. They detailed the timing of when the Justice Department began its probe into Abrego Garcia, and when they secured a federal indictment against him.",
      "They argued that the timing shows the criminal case was brought by the Trump administration \"for avowedly vindictive reasons,\" and, in their view, as a means of retaliation after Abrego Garcia's family filed a lawsuit in Maryland challenging his removal.",

      "Abrego Garcia was returned to the U.S. in May \u2014 months after Xinis, the Maryland judge presiding over the civil case, ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S .\u2014 a ruling upheld by the Supreme Court in April.",
      "The government's lack of candor and continued stonewalling prompted Xinis to threaten potential contempt proceedings earlier this year.",
      "Upon his return to the U.S. in May, Abrego Garcia was immediately slapped with two charges of human smuggling stemming from the 2022 traffic stop, prompting fresh concerns about the government's next steps.",
      "\"We have heightened, ongoing concerns about the Trump administration's compliance with any and all those involved\" in the case, Chris Newman, an attorney who represents Abrego Garcia\u2019s family, told Fox News Digital in an interview last month.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers noted Tuesday that, in their view, the government \"responded not with contrition, or with any effort to fix its mistake, but with defiance.\"",
      "\"A group of the most senior officials in the United States sought vengeance: they began a public campaign to punish Mr. Abrego for daring to fight back, culminating in the criminal investigation that led to the charges in this case,\" his lawyers said in the Tuesday filing.",
      "\"Rather than fix its mistake and return Mr. Abrego to the United States, the government fought back at every level of the federal court system. And at every level, Mr. Abrego won,\" they added. \u00a0\"This case results from the government\u2019s concerted effort to punish him for having the audacity to fight back, rather than accept a brutal injustice.\"",
      "His lawyers urged Crenshaw to move quickly to dismiss the indictment.",
      "The motion to dismiss the criminal case comes just days before Abrego Garcia is slated to be released from federal custody on Friday, after both U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes and Crenshaw agreed to grant the 30-day stay requested by Abrego Garcia's legal team.",

      "Trump officials, for their part, have said they will immediately seek to take Abrego Garcia into ICE custody and begin removal proceedings to a third country. They told Xinis' court last month that the handoff would likely occur at the federal detention center where he is currently being held.",
      "In the filing, lawyers noted the difficult burden of proof that the defense must satisfy, under the Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure, in order for a court to dismiss an indictment based on \"selective or vindictive prosecution,\" as their filing asks of Judge Crenshaw.",

      "This attack is part of a broader wave of data theft linked to the ShinyHunters group. In recent months, they have targeted Salesforce customer service systems used by major global brands. High-profile victims include Adidas, Qantas, Louis Vuitton and even Google.",
      "Ricardo Amper, CEO of Incode Technologies, a global leader in identity verification and AI-powered fraud prevention, calls this a dangerous shift.",
      "\"This signals hackers like ShinyHunters evolving from brute-force hacks to AI-amplified social engineering, targeting third-party platforms where humans are the weak link.

      "\"Attackers today are digital con artists with an unprecedented toolkit,\" Amper explains.\u00a0\"With AI, they can convincingly impersonate real people using cloned voices, speech patterns and even realistic video deepfakes. With just 10-20 seconds of someone's voice, they can create an audio clone that sounds exactly like them. Armed with this, attackers call customer service reps, posing as an executive, a partner or a high-value customer, and request sensitive account changes or data access.\"",

      "\"The best AI deepfakes are nearly impossible for humans to detect in real time,\" says Amper.\u00a0\"Pauses, awkward phrasing, bad audio, those giveaways are disappearing.\"",
      "Why customer service platforms are prime targets",
      "Customer service portals hold a wealth of personal information and often have the power to reset accounts or override security settings. This combination makes them especially attractive to hackers.",
      "\"Customer service platforms are considered a treasure trove because they store detailed personal data, transaction histories, and sometimes have capabilities to reset passwords or override security settings,\" Amper notes. \"Unlike core financial systems, many lack robust security controls, making them accessible to attackers armed with partial user information.\"",

Pair your caution with strong antivirus tools which can block dangerous websites, phishing attempts and malware before they get a chance to run.

      "The breach was carried out by ShinyHunters, a well-known cybercriminal group formally tracked as UNC6040. The group has recently been linked to a string of high-profile incidents involving companies such as AT&T, Ticketmaster, Allianz Life and Pandora. In this case, the attackers targeted Google's corporate Salesforce system, which the company uses to store contact information and notes about small and medium-sized businesses.",

      "3. Pellet formation: The blended material is pressed, heated and cut into small pellets that can be easily stored and transported.",
      "4. Asphalt integration: These pellets are added to reclaimed asphalt and bitumen. During heating, the pellets melt and release reinforcing fibers that strengthen the final asphalt mix.",

      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Stronger roads and a cleaner planet thanks to cigarette butt recycling",
      "Recycled cigarette butts make asphalt stronger, more flexible and longer-lasting. The fibers released during mixing act as micro reinforcement, improving fatigue resistance and helping roads withstand heavy traffic and temperature changes. The wax in the pellets lowers the temperature needed to mix asphalt, reducing both energy use and emissions during production. Beyond performance, this method gives cigarette waste a second life. By repurposing billions of discarded filters, cities can reduce litter and pollution while building more sustainable infrastructure.",

      "What cities are doing next with recycled cigarette butts",

The issue, demonstrated by Marco Figueroa, shows how generative AI tools can be misled through indirect prompt injection. This technique embeds invisible commands inside the body of an email. When Gemini summarizes the message, it interprets and acts on those hidden prompts.",

      "The attack does not rely on suspicious links or attachments. Instead, it uses a combination of HTML and CSS to conceal the prompt by setting the font size to zero and the color to white. These commands remain invisible in Gmail's standard view but are still accessible to Gemini. Once you request a summary, the AI can be tricked into presenting fake security alerts or urgent instructions that appear to come from Google.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself from phishing scams that exploit AI tools like Gemini? Here are six essential steps you can take right now to stay safe:",
      "Just because a summary appears in Gmail or Docs does not mean it is automatically safe. Treat AI-generated suggestions, alerts or links with the same caution you would any unsolicited message. Always verify critical information, such as security alerts or phone numbers, through official sources.",
      "If an email seems unusual, especially if it is unexpected or from someone you do not recognize, avoid using the AI summary feature. Instead, read the full email as it was originally written. This lowers the chance of falling for misleading summaries.",
      "Watch for emails or messages that create a sense of urgency, ask you to verify account details or provide unexpected links or contact information, even if they appear trustworthy or come from familiar sources. Attackers can use AI to craft realistic-looking alerts or requests for sensitive information, sometimes concealed within automatically generated summaries. So, always pause and scrutinize suspicious prompts before responding.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0CyberGuy.com/LockUpYourTech",
      "Ensure that Google Workspace and your browser are always running the latest version. Google regularly releases security updates that help prevent newer types of attacks. Also, avoid using unofficial extensions that have access to your Gmail or Docs.",
      "AI-driven scams like the Gemini summary attack don't happen in a vacuum. They often begin with stolen personal information. That data might come from past breaches, public records or details you've unknowingly shared online. A data removal service can help by continuously scanning and requesting the removal of your information from data broker sites. While no service can wipe everything, reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for attackers to personalize phishing attempts or link you to known breach data. Think of it as one more layer of protection in a world where AI makes targeted scams even easier.",

      "The Woohoo restaurant driven by AI in Dubai (Woohoo)",
      "How Chef Aiman powers Dubai's AI-driven restaurant menu",
      "At Woohoo, your waiter might be human, but the creative mind behind your dish is not. That job belongs to Chef Aiman, a large language model trained on food science, global culinary traditions and molecular gastronomy. The name Aiman blends \"AI\" and \"man,\" reflecting the partnership between technology and human creativity. Aiman doesn't taste or smell. Instead, it analyzes ingredients by texture, acidity, umami and dozens of other variables to invent dishes that push boundaries.",
      "Woohoo offers rotating menus that fuse global cuisines, designed entirely by this AI chef. Expect bold flavors, artistic presentation and creative combinations you won't find anywhere else. Each visit brings something new, exciting and full of surprises. However, Woohoo goes far beyond the plate.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "Unlike a typical restaurant, it uses artificial intelligence to shape your entire dining journey. From the lighting and sound to the pace of service and flow of the meal, every detail is curated by AI. The goal is to create a multi-sensory experience that feels futuristic but still personal. While the dishes challenge tradition, the atmosphere adapts to create a mood that feels just right, every time. Then comes the human touch.",
      "Interior of the Woohoo restaurant driven by AI in Dubai\u00a0 (Woohoo)",
      "Why human chefs still play a key role at Woohoo",
      "While Chef Aiman designs the initial recipes, Dubai-based chef Reif Othman and his kitchen team take charge of refining each dish. They taste, adjust and perfect the AI-created ideas to ensure the flavors and presentation meet high culinary standards. This collaboration blends the precision and innovation of AI with the experience and intuition of skilled chefs. Rather than replacing human creativity, Chef Aiman enhances it by opening new possibilities and inspiring chefs to explore unique flavor combinations.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How Woohoo uses AI to cut kitchen waste and boost sustainability",
      "Chef Aiman is trained to reuse ingredients many kitchens throw away, like fat and trimmings. These otherwise discarded components become key ingredients in entirely new dishes. Ahmet Oytun Cakir, one of the founders and the CEO of Gastronaut, says this feature could help reduce kitchen waste worldwide. Eventually, the hope is to license Chef Aiman to restaurants around the globe.",
      "nterior of the Woohoo restaurant driven by AI in Dubai (Woohoo)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you're planning a trip to Dubai, Woohoo offers more than a photo-worthy meal. It's a chance to taste what happens when artificial intelligence and culinary artistry work hand in hand. Beyond the dining room, this experiment has bigger implications. AI could help chefs everywhere become more sustainable, more creative and more efficient without losing the human touch that makes food special.",

It's teaming up with real chefs to spark new ideas and reduce waste. Whether you're a foodie looking for something new, a tech geek chasing the next innovation or just curious about what's next, Woohoo gives you a front-row seat to the future of dining.

      "The Menendez brothers were sentenced in 1996 to life without the possibility of parole for the 1989 killings of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez, in the family\u2019s Beverly Hills mansion. At the time of the crime, Erik was 18 and Lyle was 21.",

      "Prosecutors argued the murders were financially motivated, pointing to the couple\u2019s multimillion-dollar estate. The defense, however, claimed the brothers had endured years of sexual and emotional abuse at the hands of their father, leading to a violent confrontation.",
      "For decades, the Menendez brothers have remained behind bars. However, in May 2025, a judge reduced their sentences to 50 years to life, citing a California law that allows parole consideration for individuals who were under 26 when their crimes were committed.",

      "\"The Menendez brothers have never fully accepted responsibility for the horrific murders of their parents, instead continuing to promote a false narrative of self-defense that was rejected by the jury decades ago,\" Hochman's office said. \"We have consistently opposed their release because they have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes or shown that they have been fully rehabilitated, and therefore continue to pose a risk to society.\"",

      "\"As always, our family remains cautiously optimistic, grounding ourselves in the reality that California\u2019s parole process is incredibly rigorous, with low grant rates. We respect that and know Erik and Lyle are prepared for that level of scrutiny,\" the statement read.",
      "\"For more than 35 years, they have shown sustained growth,\" the coalition added. \"They\u2019ve taken full accountability. They express sincere remorse to our family to this day and have built a meaningful life defined by purpose and service. Something that has really stayed with us, especially as we near the parole hearings, is what Judge Jesic said during resentencing: that while Erik and Lyle have a stellar record, it was the letters of support from individuals who had never spoken up for an incarcerated person before that impacted him most. It\u2019s a reminder that no paper file can fully capture a person\u2019s character. But we see it. Correctional staff see it. Now, we hope the parole commissioners will see the same. We know that Erik and Lyle will come home, that is no longer a doubt. We just hope that they are granted this second chance in time to hug their Aunt Joan and Aunt Terry.\"",

      "\"The shutting down of radio stations beaming information into North Korea is a catastrophic strategic mistake. True change can't come from the Kim family.

      "President Donald Trump recently threatened the European pharmaceutical industry with tariffs as high as 250% and the region's semiconductor industry with tariff rates as high as 100%.",
      "The announcement comes as Trump's global trade agenda takes shape weeks after his administration locked in tariff rates for imports from dozens of countries. Economists warn that the tariffs, a tax on goods paid by importing companies, are fueling persistent inflation. The Trump administration has touted tens of billions of dollars in revenue from the duties.",
      "In a statement, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said, \"Faced with a challenging situation, we have delivered for our Member States and industry, and restored clarity and coherence to transatlantic trade.\"",
      "The E.U. also stressed that \"tariffs are paid by the company importing the imported goods.\"",

      "Sean 'Diddy' Combs' request for an acquittal or a new trial should be quickly rejected, prosecutors said in a new court filing almost three weeks after the music mogul was convicted of two charges related to prostitution.",
      "In a filing made public just before midnight on Wednesday, prosecutors said there were no legal grounds for the court to grant Combs' request to quash his convictions and that he should be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "Combs, 55, was acquitted of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at his lengthy and high-profile, seven-week trial in New York last month. At the time, Lead attorney Marc Agnifilo called the verdict \"a great victory for Sean Combs.\"",
      "But the convictions against him on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution could see him jailed for up to 20 years under the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said after the trial that prosecutors would seek a sentence of between 4 and 5 years behind bars.",
      "Combs was denied bail and has remained in jail since the trial, as his defense team continues to argue that he should serve no time.",
      "In previous legal filings, Combs' lawyers have argued that the Mann Act is vague and violates his First Amendment rights. None of the elements generally used in a Mann Act conviction were present in this case, they argued, including that Combs had no financial motive. Instead, he had \"paid to engage in voyeurism as part of a \u2018swingers\u2019 lifestyle,\" the filings said.",
      "Prosecutors, however, argue that not only was the Mann Act clear and relevant to this case, but there was \"overwhelming\" evidence to support his conviction, centered on the now well-known \"freak offs\" and \"hotel nights,\" drug-fueled sex parties in luxury hotels that involved male sex workers.",
      "\"The defendant masterminded every aspect of Freak Offs,\" the prosecution said in its U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York filing.",
      "\"He transported escorts across state lines to engage in Freak Offs for pay. He directed the sexual activity of escorts and victims throughout Freak Offs for his own sexual gratification. And he personally engaged in sexual activity during Freak Offs,\" the filing said.",
      "NBC News has contacted Combs's attorneys for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "The case against Combs fell apart in court despite the years-long efforts of federal prosecutors to build evidence to prove the sex trafficking charges against him. More than 30 prosecution witnesses were called in total, while the defense called none.",
      "During the trial, the jury was shown harrowing video evidence showing him assaulting R&B artist Cassie, a former girlfriend whose real name is Casandra Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Ventura told the trial that Combs was angered that she had decided to leave a freak off."

      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
      "\u201cThese missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,\u201d the report said.",
      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Researchers said the report was based on interviews with defectors and officials around the world, as well as declassified documents, satellite images and open-source information.",
      "The report said the weapons at the base could include North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMs, or a missile that has yet to be revealed.",
      "\u201cCurrent assessments are that during times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites.\u201d",
      "According to the latest estimate from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea has assembled about 50 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.",
      "Construction of the Sinpung-dong base began around 2004 and it was \u201cgenerally complete and operational\u201d by 2014, the report said. Satellite images suggest the base continues to be developed and \u201cis active and being well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d it said.",
      "It is one of about 15 to 20 ballistic missile bases and related facilities across the country that North Korea has never declared, the report said.",
      "Since the breakdown of denuclearization talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in 2019, North Korea has been steadily advancing its weapons programs in defiance of international sanctions.",
      "It has also strengthened security ties with Russia, including sending arms and troops to fight in its war against Ukraine in exchange for support that experts say could include technological assistance with its weapons programs.",
      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "On Monday, Kim called for a rapid nuclear buildup amid annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises that Pyongyang sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",
      "Though Trump has expressed an interest in resuming in-person diplomacy with Kim, his regime has dismissed the idea and says the United States must accept North Korea as a nuclear power."

      "Fresh data released this week underscored just how stuck the U.S. housing market is.",
      "On Monday, a closely watched sentiment index of the companies that build U.S. houses returned to its 2\u00bd-year low. A day later, the Commerce Department reported that the number of new housing starts and permits for single-family homes had edged higher in July but were still near post-pandemic lows.",
      "Housing prices remain high, as do mortgage interest rates. Reasons for optimism are scarce.",
      "\u201cElevated mortgage rates continue to hold back sales of new homes, but the sharp further decline in homebuilders\u2019 confidence since the start of this year seems partly to reflect both a hit to consumers\u2019 confidence from the tariffs and slowing economy,\u201d Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist with Pantheon Macroeconomics, a research group, said in a note this week.",
      "But even as President Donald Trump demands that the Federal Reserve cut its influential interest rates, economists are concerned that mortgage rates will remain elevated until the economy falters.",
      "Even after the Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point last year \u2014 with more cuts likely this year \u2014 home borrowing costs have remained stubbornly high, said Lance Lambert, editor-in-chief and a co-founder of ResiClub, a housing analytics firm.",
      "It would most likely take a dramatically worsening economy to materially lower mortgage rates, Lambert said.",
      "\u201cA really big move down would come from a scenario where unemployment shoots up and the economy deteriorates,\u201d he said.",
      "The Federal Reserve can\u2019t unilaterally lower the cost of a home mortgage for consumers, because the interest rates it sets don\u2019t directly affect it. Still, Trump on Tuesday again called on Fed Chair Jerome Powell to lower the central bank\u2019s key federal funds rate.",
      "\u201cCould somebody please inform Jerome \u2018Too Late\u2019 Powell that he is hurting the Housing Industry, very badly?\u201d Trump wrote Tuesday evening on Truth Social. \u201cPeople can\u2019t get a Mortgage because of him. There is no Inflation, and every sign is pointing to a major Rate Cut. \u2018Too Late\u2019 is a disaster!\u201d",
      "Anyone expecting lower rates from the Federal Reserve to provide much relief may end up disappointed. Mortgage rates are more closely tied to investor demand for longer-term government bonds like the 10-year Treasury note. When demand for those bonds increases, their interest rates, or yield, decline \u2014 and so do mortgage rates. Demand for such bonds is driven by a host of factors, including expectations about inflation and overall economic growth, as well as views of the government\u2019s fiscal health.",
      "Since Trump\u2019s re-election in November, the yield on the 10-year note hasn\u2019t changed much, though it has experienced large short-term swings, as in the wake of Trump\u2019s \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs announcement in April. As of Wednesday, the yield on the 10-year note was about 4.3%. Similarly, there has been little change in mortgage rates over the same period: During the week of Election Day, the 30-year mortgage rate stood at 6.8%. Today, it\u2019s at 6.6%.",
      "That rate reflects the general uncertainty Trump\u2019s mix of tariff, immigration and fiscal policies has created for the economy.",
      "The Mortgage Bankers Association said last month that \u201ctrade and geopolitical uncertainty,\u201d as well as debt and deficit concerns, has continued to fuel concerns about demand for U.S. bonds, which are usually regarded as \u201csafe haven\u201d assets because the government\u2019s default risk is supposed to be zero. It cited Moody\u2019s downgrade of the United States\u2019 bond rating in May as reason for ongoing concerns about the government\u2019s ability to borrow, though a separate note this week from S&P reaffirmed the country\u2019s current credit rating.",
      "In a statement, a White House spokesman said:",
      "\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s trade deals have unlocked unprecedented market access for American exports to economies that in total are worth over $32 trillion with 1.2 billion people. As these historic trade deals and the Administration\u2019s pro-growth domestic agenda of deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill\u2019s tax cuts take effect, American businesses and families alike have the certainty that the best is yet to come.\u201d",
      "A Fed move to lower its key rate would provide some relief to the market on the margin, said Robert Deitz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. Specifically, it would lower the cost of borrowing money for homebuilders seeking to embark on new projects.",
      "\u201cMonetary policy easing would help,\u201d he said.",
      "But it\u2019s not clear buyers would emerge if more new homes hit the market. Homebuilders have gone to extremes to lure buyers. The homebuilders association reported Monday that the use of sales incentives was 66% in August, up from 62% in July and the highest percentage in the post-Covid period.",
      "\u201cThe challenges the housing market has suffered through for more than a decade are fundamentally about frictions in the market that\u2019s resulted in a structural housing deficit,\u201d Dietz said. \u201cLabor shortage, lack of lots, financing issues on the supply side, supply-chain issues, regulatory costs \u2014 they\u2019re all making it take longer and [be] more expensive to build a home.\u201d"

      "PASSAIC, N.J. \u2014 With an empanada in one hand, Republican Jack Ciattarelli spent part of last Saturday afternoon at El Primito restaurant here, making his case to be New Jersey's next governor instead of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill.",
      "\u201cMy opponent is a continuation of Phil Murphy\u2019s policy,\u201d Ciattarelli told customers at the restaurant, referring to the state's  Democratic governor.",
      "It\u2019s no accident that Ciattarelli took his case against Sherrill to this this city and this restaurant, where a mural of the Dominican Republic\u2019s countryside stretches across a wall and the country\u2019s flags hang over a doorway.",
      "Trump won Passaic County, which includes the city by the same name, by 3 percentage points last year. A former Democratic stronghold, Passaic saw the largest swing toward Trump of any county in the Garden State in 2024 compared to the 2020 election. And it\u2019s home to the largest share of Latino residents of any New Jersey county.",
      "Trump\u2019s gains in Passaic and other New Jersey counties with sizable Latino populations reflected his broader gains among Latino voters across the country in 2024. Now, this year\u2019s race for governor in New Jersey, one of two governor's races in the country in 2025, is an early testing ground for both parties as they try to grapple with that shift. Republicans are looking to sustain Trump\u2019s gains among Latino voters without the president on the ballot, while Democrats are trying to win back voters who used to be in their corner.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be the decisive factor,\u201d Patricia Campos-Medina, a Sherill campaign vice chair, said of the Latino vote.",
      "Mike Madrid, a Republican strategist who has studied Latino voters, said the New Jersey race is \u201ca perfect petri dish to ask this question as to whether or not Latinos are an ethnic voting bloc or an economic pocketbook, blue-collar voting bloc.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are both,\u201d Madrid later added. \u201cAnd both parties try to make it either-or, which is why neither one of them has a hold on the fastest growing segment of the electorate.\u201d",
      "Economic focus",
      "The economy, and Trump\u2019s own brand of \u201ceconomic populism,\u201d was the main driver of Latino voters\u2019 shift to the right as they struggled with the high costs of living, political strategists and officials in both parties say.",
      "\u201cThe conversation that Donald Trump had, it was the conversation that they want to hear,\u201d Jose Arango, the GOP chair in Hudson County, said of Latino voters in his community. Trump also improved on his 2020 margin there last year.",
      "\u201cHomeland security, law and order, school choice, pro-business, lower taxes, equality, taking all the woke policies out of the schools,\u201d Arango added.",
      "Campos-Medina said Democrats \u201cgot lazy\u201d when it came to outreach to Latino voters in New Jersey and across the country last year.",
      "\u201cWe care about the same issues that white suburban voters, Black urban voters care about. And No. 1 ... is the economy,\u201d Campos-Medina said, later adding that Democrats\u2019 main message to Latino voters boiled down to: \u201cTrump is bad. Trump doesn\u2019t like immigrants.\u201d",
      "Campos-Medina noted the sizable swath of Latino voters in New Jersey \u2014 incorporating significant numbers who are Puerto Rican, Dominican, Central American, Cuban and Mexican \u2014 include many small-business owners who \u201cfelt disconnected from the\u201d Democratic Party.",
      "But she is confident that Sherrill\u2019s focus on driving down costs will appeal to Latino voters who may be disenchanted with Democrats.",
      "\u201cHer message has always been about, \u2018How am I going to improve the economy? How am I going to help the small-business owners? How am I going to lower the cost of groceries in New Jersey?\u2019\u201d Campos-Medina said. \u201cAnd I think that is appealing to folks because they\u2019re listening to everyday concerns.\u201d",
      "Campos-Medina said the Sherrill campaign has been prioritizing outreach to the Latino community, convening meetings with business leaders and attending local events.",
      "A few hours after Ciattarelli greeted customers at El Primito on Saturday, Sherrill, 53, a former prosecutor and Navy pilot, attended the annual Puerto Rican Day Parade & Festival in Jersey City. Afterward, she said, in a statement in Spanish, that it was a \u201ctrue honor\u201d to recognize \u201cthe pride, traditions, and valuable contributions that the Puerto Rican community brings to the Garden State.\u201d",
      "Some Democrats also believe Latino voters who rejected Democrats last year will ultimately blame Trump for their current economic woes and, in turn, oppose Ciattarelli, amid concerns that Trump\u2019s tariff policy could drive up prices and his sweeping tax cut and spending law could slash social safety nets like Medicaid.",
      "\u201cCiattarelli, in my opinion, is going to have to own everything this administration has done, because he\u2019s showing no willingness to act independently of it,\u201d said Rep. Rob Menendez, D-N.J.",
      "But Ciattarelli, 63, a former state lawmaker and small businessman, is betting that voters who are concerned about the state\u2019s high cost of living will ultimately place the blame on Murphy and his fellow Democrats.",
      "Asked if Trump bears any responsibility for voters\u2019 persistent economic concerns, Ciattarelli said: \u201cThe economy did better in his first term than it did in Joe Biden\u2019s term. And we\u2019ve just received news the unemployment rate is down and that consumer price index is down significantly. So there is greater confidence in President Trump\u2019s economic policies.\"",
      "\"But let\u2019s be clear, what\u2019s going on with our state economy has everything to do with the current administration,\u201d Ciattarelli said, referring to Murphy.",
      "Angel Castillo, who owns El Primito restaurant in Passaic, said that\u2019s why he\u2019s backing Ciattarelli again this year, after voting for him in 2021 when he lost a close race to Murphy.",
      "\u201cRight now, the cost of living throughout the whole state is ridiculous. Especially a little business like this, we\u2019re barely making it,\u201d Castillo said. \u201cAnd I can show you my electric bill. My electric bill, since Murphy took office, almost doubled.\u201d",
      "\u2018Buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019?",
      "While the economy remains a top issue for Latino voters, Trump\u2019s efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and ramp up deportations are also raising concerns among Latino voters across the country and in New Jersey, where nearly 1 in 4 residents are foreign-born.",
      "A national survey of Latino voters conducted in late July by Equis Research, a Democratic firm, found 26% of Latino voters who cast ballots for Trump last year said they are disappointed in him or regret voting for him, citing Trump\u2019s focus on mass deportations and inaction on the economy.",
      "In New Jersey, a majority of likely voters, including Hispanics, say the Trump administration is doing \u201ctoo much\u201d on deportations, according to a July Fairleigh Dickinson University survey. Nearly 30% of voters overall, and half of Hispanic voters, say they are worried a family member or close friend could be deported.",
      "\u201cEvery Puerto Rican and Dominican that I\u2019ve talked to in New Jersey who supported Donald Trump has all said the same thing in focus groups, which is: \u2018I wanted him to bring prices down. I thought Joe Biden was old and weak, but I did not vote for him to start locking up folks who just came here seeking a better life, who\u2019ve broken no laws other than trying to flee to this country for safety,\u2019\u201d said Democratic strategist Chuck Rocha, who has conducted focus groups with Latino nonprofits throughout the Northeast.",
      "Menendez, the congressman, said Ciattarelli will also have to own Trump\u2019s immigration actions, noting: \u201cThere\u2019s already buyer's remorse, not just in the Latino community, but in a lot of different pockets of this state and this country. And that\u2019s absolutely going to be on the ballot come November.\u201d",
      "Campos-Medina said the deportations have stoked fear and uncertainty among Latino communities in New Jersey, which could hurt Hispanic-owned businesses if their customers are wary of going out.",
      "While Campos-Medina said Democrats\u2019 message should be focused on the economy, she added, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t acknowledge the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our communities, in the harassment, in the terrorization of our immigrant neighbors.\u201d",
      "Ciattarelli said he did not disagree with Trump\u2019s approach to deportations, noting that Trump\u2019s victory in Passaic County last year \u201cstrongly suggests that Latinos that are here legally support the president\u2019s efforts in securing the border and deporting people that came here illegally who have a history of criminality in their country of origin and/or have committed a crime since arriving illegally.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs I go around the state, I find Latino Americans support that policy,\u201d Ciattarelli said. \u201cAs do I.\u201d",
      "That includes Castillo, the Passaic restaurant owner, who dismissed any concerns about deportations.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re here and you\u2019re here doing the right thing, why should you be worried about it?\u201d he said.",
      "Even as Ciattarelli makes his case, early polling suggests that Sherrill could have an edge among Latino voters this fall.",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll and a StimSight Research Survey from July both found Sherrill with leads in the low double-digits among Latino voters, although both surveys had small sample sizes, meaning there is larger room for error. Both surveys also found sizable chunks of Latino voters remain undecided in the race.",
      "Those undecided voters include a woman named Jess, who declined to share her last name while discussing politics. She chatted briefly with Ciattarelli as he visited Parrillada Costambar, a Dominican restaurant in Paterson, later on Saturday afternoon.",
      "A Democrat who voted for Vice President Kamala Harris last year, Jess said she is has not yet decided if she'll back Sherrill or Ciattarelli for governor, noting that combating drugs and improving education are among her top issues.",
      "\u201cI have to sit down and see their proposals to see what they are going to do for us,\u201d she said."

      "Erik and Lyle Menendez are taking another step on what could be their path to freedom.",
      "The brothers, who have served more than three decades in prison for the 1989 murders of their parents, will appear before California parole officials Thursday and Friday in a bid to convince the panel that they are suitable for release.",
      "A Los Angeles judge found three months ago that the men do not pose an \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d and resentenced them to 50 years to life \u2014 a decision that effectively canceled their previous prison terms of life without the possibility of parole and made them eligible for \"suitability\" hearings immediately.",
      "Erik, 54, will appear before the board Thursday. Lyle, 57, will appear Friday.",
      "Commissioners will weigh possible testimony from victims\u2019 relatives and prosecutors, and they will consider a range of factors, including the brothers\u2019 criminal histories, their behavior while they were incarcerated and their release plans.",
      "If they are found suitable for parole, a review process that can take nearly a half-year follows. The decision to release the brothers will ultimately land with California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who has 30 days to affirm, reverse or modify the decision or refer it back to the parole board.",
      "Newsom, whose office oversaw a separate and still-pending clemency application from the brothers, has declined to comment on what he would do if the board recommends parole.",
      "The brothers were convicted of first-degree murder in 1996 after two trials that spanned three years. They claimed they killed their parents, Jos\u00e9 and Kitty Menendez, in self-defense after years of abuse at their father\u2019s hands.",
      "Prosecutors have disputed those claims and pointed to the grim specifics of the killings \u2014 Lyle reloaded his shotgun before he shot his mother in the face, for example \u2014 and they described the killings as ruthless and financially motivated.",
      "Speaking at the resentencing hearing, Erik described his crimes as \u201ccruel and vicious\u201d and said he was \u201cdirectly responsible for it all.\u201d",

      "When is someone convicted of murder considered rehabilitated?",
      "Menendez supporters say brothers should go free \u2014 but prosecutors who tried them believe they got what they deserved",
      "Their case was catapulted back into the spotlight after a pair of streaming series and advocacy from some high-profile figures and relatives. The effort to secure their release has highlighted the sometimes complicated debate over rehabilitation versus incarceration.",
      "Many family members have been outspoken advocates for the brothers\u2019 freedom. After their resentencing hearing in May, a cousin, Anamaria Baralt, attributed the judge\u2019s decision to the brothers\u2019 growth behind bars and the \u201cpurpose of service\u201d that she said they exhibited.",
      "Among other things, the brothers have attended college, established a \u201cbeautification\u201d project at the San Diego prison where they are incarcerated and helped inmates with severe disabilities, court filings show.",
      "Baralt said she expected the parole process to be difficult on the brothers\u2019 family but added: \u201cWe will eagerly step through those doors if that means getting them home.\u201d",
      "The Los Angeles County District Attorney\u2019s Office has had different views on the brothers\u2019 push for freedom. Weeks before his ouster last year, the county\u2019s former top prosecutor, George Gasc\u00f3n, said the siblings had been \u201cexceptional\u201d inmates and recommended that they be resentenced.",
      "His successor, Nathan Hochman, tried \u2014 and failed \u2014 to withdraw that recommendation. He said the siblings had not taken responsibility for more than a dozen lies he said they told about the murders, including the claim that they killed their parents in self-defense.",
      "\u201cThe Menendez brothers have never fully accepted responsibility for the horrific murders of their parents, instead continuing to promote a false narrative of self-defense that was rejected by the jury decades ago,\" Hochman said in a statement ahead of the hearings.",
      "\"We have consistently opposed their release at this time because they have not demonstrated full insight into their crimes or shown that they have been fully rehabilitated, and therefore continue to pose a risk to society,\" he said.",
      "Representatives from his office will attend the hearing, he has said, and their level of participation will be determined by the parole board.",
      "If their parole is denied, the brothers still have their clemency application with the governor's office. And they have sought to have their convictions overturned through a separate process that continues."

And while you can use the cloths dry, damp cloths are much better at holding onto debris, says Mock. \u201cA dry cloth may just push the dust around or create static that attracts more dust,\u201d she says. You can wet microfiber cloths with water, an all-purpose cleaning solution or disinfectant, but be careful not to add too much, as it can leave streaks on surfaces.",

Then, as you wipe dust off surfaces, the sponge\u2019s ridged exterior traps particles. The sponge also compresses so you can squeeze it into tight spaces. When it gets dirty, you can rinse it off and reuse it. Be sure to store it in a cool, dry place when you\u2019re not using it to prevent bacteria growth, according to the brand.",

      "How to dust properly, according to experts",
      "Yes, there is a right way to dust, although the majority of people dust incorrectly, experts told me. Dusting properly is crucial \u2014 it ensures you\u2019re actually lifting dust off surfaces and removing it from your home. Otherwise, you might just be moving dust around or putting it into the air.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning, consider wearing a face mask so you don\u2019t inhale any of the dust particles that might make their way into the air, says Dr. Shradha Agarwal, an allergist and immunologist at Mount Sinai Health System\u2019s Icahn School of Medicine. Below, experts share tips for effective dusting.",
      "While you\u2019re cleaning higher areas, some particles fall onto surfaces beneath them. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to dust from top to bottom \u2014 once you get to the lower areas, you can collect the dust that was there in the first place, plus any that made its way down during the cleaning process. Mock also recommends dusting first, then vacuuming. The vacuum can suck up any dirt and debris that got onto the floor while you were dusting.",
      "If you\u2019re dusting horizontally, make sure to clean in one direction (either right to left or left to right) instead of going back and forth. Doing so ensures you don\u2019t dirty already-clean areas, says Mock.",
      "People most often forget to dust hard-to-reach areas in their homes, says Mock. This includes ceiling fans, light fixtures, behind furniture, the tops of door frames and under appliances. Ignoring these spaces allows layers of dust to build up over time, eventually creating dust bunnies, which are small clumps of dust, lint, hair and other debris.",
      "Be sure to clean reusable dusters after every job, or trash used disposable dusters and swap them out for new ones. Even if your duster doesn\u2019t look dirty, it likely has microscopic dust particles on it that you can spread to other surfaces. Start every new clean with a fresh duster to avoid that.",
      "How to reduce dust in your home",
      "If your home is particularly dusty, spend some time identifying the root cause, says Hicks. Doing so can reduce how much and how fast dust builds up, making regular weekly maintenance easier. Here are some steps you can take to reduce dust and dust mites in your home.",
      "Regularly clean fabric and upholstered surfaces: Dust mites usually settle on bedding, upholstered furniture, curtains, drapes and carpeting, not hard surfaces like wood, says Agarwal. Cleaning these surfaces weekly helps remove and kill dust mites, and you can also put dust mite-impermeable covers on mattresses, box springs and pillows, she says. Additionally, try not to add a lot of additional fabric into your home from decor like accent pillows or stuffed animals, for example.Use an air purifier and/or dehumidifiers: Air purifiers with HEPA filters can help remove dust particles and other allergens like pollen, dander and pet hair from the air, while dehumidifiers can reduce condensation in homes. \u201cDust mites have decreased survival and multiplication when humidity is below 50% consistently,\u201d says Agarwal. Also be sure to repair any leaks in your home, as that could also contribute to the buildup of moisture.Keep your air conditioner and furnace filters clean: Furnace and air conditioner filters do an amazing job of preventing outdoor dirt and dust from entering your home, says Hicks. But if they\u2019re dirty, they\u2019re not as effective as they\u2019re designed to be. Be sure to clean or replace these filters on a regular schedule to ensure they\u2019re doing their jobs. Similarly, cleaning your air ducts to maintain healthy indoor air quality is also important, says Hicks. You should swap out the filter on your air purifier periodically, too.Close your windows: Open windows provide fresh air and a nice breeze, but they allow debris from the outdoors to flood inside your home, says Hicks. Dirt and pollen that come inside eventually settle on surfaces, which creates more dust and circulates in the air that you then breathe in.",

      "Frequently asked questions",
      "Dust is a collection of particles including skin, fibers, hair, bacteria, soil, pollen and more, says Agarwal. And if you\u2019re in a particularly dusty area, you may experience symptoms like sneezing, coughing, itchy skin, watery eyes and even shortness of breath, she told us. However, feeling irritated by dust is different from having an allergy related to dust.",
      "\u201cWhen speaking in reference to allergies, we worry about dust mites,\u201d says Agarwal. \u201cDust mites are arthropods that are found in the dust of homes located in regions where they are prevalent. They cannot be seen with the naked eye and feed off of organic matter such as skin scales, and bacteria and require moisture for survival.\u201d",
      "Dust mites are not usually found in dry climates, which is why they\u2019re less prevalent in the western U.S. They thrive in warmer, wetter climates, and there are higher concentrations of dust mites in older homes prone to mold, homes with a lot of carpeting and homes that deal with other pests like roaches, according to Agarwal. Dust mite allergies can lead to inflammation inside the nose and asthma or eczema flare-ups, she says. So while dusting is important regardless of where you live, it\u2019s even more crucial if you live in an area where there are dust mites.",
      "You should dust surfaces in your home at least once a week, experts told us. However, dusting frequency depends on factors like the size of your home, the level of foot traffic and activity and the types of surfaces you\u2019ll be cleaning, says Mock. If you have pets, consider increasing the number of times you dust a week, especially during shedding seasons, says Hicks. Pet hair and dander contribute to dust buildup in homes, and more shedding means more dust.",
      "Additionally, if you live in an area where dust mites are prevalent, you should dust more frequently. Mock recommends dusting after home improvement projects or renovations as well, as they tend to create a lot of dust.",

Maybe you carry a tiny bottle of one that sets your mouth on fire at all times, or perhaps you exclusively add a few drops of a mild option to scrambled eggs. Whatever your preferences are, hot sauce amps up the flavor and spice level of food, making it a versatile condiment that nearly every cuisine across the world has its own version of, says Julian Plovnick, a chef and culinary specialist at Sur La Table.",
      "To help you navigate the crowded hot sauce market, the NBC Select staff tested over 30 types from brands like Tabasco, Melinda\u2019s, Yellowbird, Truff and Huy Fong Foods.

      "How we tested hot sauces",
      "There are hundreds (yes, literally hundreds) of hot sauces out there, making it impossible for us to test them all. To narrow down which ones our team tried, I first talked to five culinary experts, including chefs and hot sauce manufacturers, about what brands they recommend. Experts also walked me through all the factors that impact a hot sauce\u2019s flavor and heat level, and explained the Scoville Scale (read all about that here). I gathered a list of hot sauce brands the NBC Select team loves, too, and researched smaller businesses gaining popularity online.",
      "I narrowed down my initial testing list of over 50 to about 30 hot sauces to test. We focused on options that are accessible at grocery stores or big retailers online and/or in stores, with a few exceptions for popular small brands. In some cases, brands sent us courtesy samples, but I bought most of the hot sauces at grocery stores in New York City. Once I had all the hot sauces, the NBC Select team spent a day tasting and evaluating them.",
      "The point of hot sauce is to enhance the flavor of food, says Lisa McManus, the executive editor of America\u2019s Test Kitchen Reviews. But what you pair them with can impact their overall flavor, so to make it an even playing field for our test, we poured hot sauces on tortilla chips, which are essentially a blank canvas. The tortilla chips were mainly made of corn, so there was nothing to cut the heat with, giving us the full impact of each sauce\u2019s spice level. This base also gave us ample opportunity to taste the flavor of each hot sauce and ensure that nothing was distracting us from its ingredients.",
      "After trying the hot sauces in-office, testers took their favorite sauces home and used them how they normally would in their day-to-day lives. They provided additional feedback for this phase of testing.",
      "What we considered",
      "During our testing, we evaluated hot sauces based on the criteria below:",
      "Overall spice level: People have different spice tolerances, but to get a general consensus from our team, testers rated heat from 1 (a little kick, nothing crazy) to 5 (offensively hot, mouth on fire, tearing, need milk immediately).Overall flavor: Testers described what ingredients they tasted most and what overall impression it gave, be it bright and fruity, sharp and acidic or warm and herby.Spice to flavor ratio: Was the hot sauce so spicy that testers only got heat and no flavor?

      "The best hot sauces, tested & reviewed",
      "Tabasco Original Red Pepper Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cIn the United States, probably the number one thing that people think of when they think of hot sauce is Tabasco,\u201d says Stephen Chavez, a senior chef-instructor at the Institute of Culinary Education\u2019s Los Angeles campus. It\u2019s considered a Louisiana-style hot sauce, meaning one that has a vinegary base, is fermented and uses medium-hot chilis like tabasco or cayenne peppers, which is where it gets its bright color from. Tabasco is also a pretty salty sauce, says Marcus Shell, the culinary director of Uptown Hospitality Group and the executive chef of By The Way in Charleston, South Carolina.",
      "Tabasco\u2019s vinegar-forward flavor is the first thing our testers noted about the hot sauce, in addition to its thin, runny consistency.  It\u2019s a very basic option made with only three ingredients, and you can find it in nearly any grocery store, as well as the pantry section of most big-box retailers. I\u2019ve even seen it in pharmacies and at gas station stores. Tabasco is one of the least intimidating sauces we tried, too \u2014 testers say it didn\u2019t linger in their mouths much. A few drops is plenty to give food a tangy kick, so if you\u2019re looking for something to get your tastebuds used to hot sauce without fear of overwhelming them, Tabasco is ideal.",
      "Franks RedHot Original Hot Sauce",
      "Similar to Tabasco, Frank\u2019s Red Hot is a Louisiana-style variety, but its consistency is a bit thicker, its flavor is less vinegary and its spice level is milder, according to our testers. It\u2019s one of NBC Select intern Andriana Kourkoumelis\u2019 all-time favorites. \u201cAs someone who enjoys a kick to my food, Frank\u2019s is the perfect level of spicy,\u201d she says. \u201cThis hot sauce has been my favorite since I was a kid and I put it on absolutely everything.\u201d The brand especially recommends adding it to wings, chicken sandwiches and buffalo chicken dip.",
      "Cholula Original Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cCholula was my introduction to hot sauce as a kid, so it\u2019s a hit of nostalgia every time I eat it,\u201d says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely versatile, so I can put it on practically any food, including eggs, avocado toast and pizza. Plus, it\u2019s not too strong, so I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in pain when I pair it with food.\u201d",
      "Cholula is a Mexican hot sauce made with various spices (although the brand doesn\u2019t specify which ones), giving it a full-bodied flavor with a firm heat index, says Shell. He finds it perfect for tacos, among other foods. I used to never reach for Cholula when it was on the table at restaurants, but after testing it, I\u2019ve begun to. I definitively taste the spices in it, making bland dishes more palatable and flavorful dishes even more nuanced. Like Tabasco, you can find Cholula nearly anywhere, so it also gets bonus points for accessibility.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Jalape\u00f1o Pepper Hot Sauce",
      "We tried Melinda\u2019s entire line of hot sauces during our testing, and out of all the green options, this jalape\u00f1o one won all our testers over. Many of them now plan to keep a bottle at home.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Jalape\u00f1o Pepper Hot Sauce stays on your tongue and in your mouth for a bit after you eat it, says NBC Select commerce editor Lindsay Schneider, who has a low heat tolerance. There\u2019s a hint of sweetness to the mild sauce, but you get a kick, too, says Godio. Melinda\u2019s, one of our favorite Latino-owned businesses, describes the flavor as tangy, zesty and zingy, and recommends eating the hot sauce with foods like tacos, tortas, burritos, enchiladas and quesadillas. Our testers only had one complaint about this hot sauce: it comes out of the bottle too slowly because the opening at the top is very narrow.",
      "Pisqueya Medium Heat Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cI remember being sad when this bottle of hot sauce was finally empty,\u201d says NBC Select reporter Harry Rabinowitz, who brought it home after our first phase of in-office testing. \u201cIt\u2019s lively \u2014 the mix of both jalapenos and habaneros gives it a fun, layered taste that\u2019s good as a hot sauce or cooking ingredient.\u201d",
      "Pisqueya\u2019s Medium Heat Hot Sauce is vibrant, bright, zesty and tangy, according to the women-owned brand. Testers say its heat builds in your mouth for a few seconds after you try it, but it doesn\u2019t stick around for long, making each bite a blank canvas. We also noticed that the garlic in the mixture grounds the acidity and peppers so all the flavors are present and well-balanced. The hot sauce is liquidy, but it\u2019s not watery at all \u2014 it has a thicker, puree-like texture to it.",
      "Truff Original Black Truffle Hot Sauce",
      "Truff\u2019s hot sauce is the only one we tested that\u2019s infused with black truffles, giving it a unique flavor \u2014 nothing we tried was remotely similar, and it was clear that the brand focused on taste, not just spice. \u201cAs a truffle lover, I\u2019m a big fan of Truff\u2019s original flavor \u2014 it\u2019s delicious and it\u2019s not too strong,\u201d says Godio, who has been a Truff customer for years. \u201cI keep my Truff hot sauce stocked at home, and I gift it to nearly all of my friends and family around the holidays.\u201d The brand gets the black truffles for its hot sauce from Northern Italy and its agave nectar from Jalisco, Mexico.",
      "Huy Fong Sriracha",
      "Sriracha is a tangy, slightly sweet and garlicky hot sauce that originated in Vietnam and is made with fresno peppers, which are red jalape\u00f1os, says Chavez. Numerous brands make their own version of it, but Huy Fong Foods\u2019 Sriracha is arguably one of first brands to bottle it up and gain notoriety in the U.S. I consider it a classic, and growing up, there was always a bottle in my family\u2019s fridge.",
      "Beyond the fact that the flavor compliments almost anything I\u2019m eating, I love the squeezy bottle dispenser, which helps me control how much I add to food. I also like the thicker, drizzle-able consistency \u2014 I often mix it into dressings, marinades and dips to add a little heat.",
      "Yellowbird Classic Jalape\u00f1o Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cThis hot sauce isn\u2019t super spicy, but it adds a nice jalapeno flavor to whatever you want,\u201d says Rabinowitz. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the most put-it-on-everything hot sauce. You can tell from the bottle, which is a plastic squeeze bottle with a screw cap, that it\u2019s basically screaming \u2018drizzle this on whatever you want.\u2019\u201d The hot sauce has a bright red color and a rich, savory flavor, plus it\u2019s on the thicker side, so it sits on top of food nicely rather than immediately getting absorbed into it.",
      "Local Hive Mango Habanero Honey Hot Sauce",
      "Local Hive is primarily a honey brand, but it makes a line of honey-infused hot sauces, all of which we tested. I immediately gravitated toward the Mango Habanero option because I prefer hot sauces that are centered around flavor rather than heat, and this was the only one we tried that had fruit as one of its main ingredients. The hot sauce has a noticeable sweetness from the mango and honey it\u2019s made with, but it\u2019s not overpowering. The sweetness cuts the heat of the habanero peppers just the right amount, although it definitely has a kick, which I primarily feel on my tongue. Because this hot sauce is slightly sweet and citrusy, I add it to foods I\u2019d typically drizzle hot honey on, and I\u2019ve enjoyed it on fish like salmon, shrimp, halibut and sole, as well as burrito bowls.",
      "Melinda\u2019s Original Habanero Extra Hot Sauce",
      "Original Habanero was our team\u2019s favorite red hot sauce from Melinda\u2019s. Rabinowitz took it home after our in-office testing, and it\u2019s the first bottle he emptied. \u201cIt\u2019s classic, versatile, easy to use and easy to enjoy,\u201d he says. \u201cI put it on basically everything and it gave a pleasant, palatable kick that wasn\u2019t too vinegar-heavy, unlike other brands\u2019 options. It\u2019s also got a classic glass bottle with good flow.\u201d The sauce is warm, fruity and citrusy, according to Melinda\u2019s.",
      "High Mesa Chili Co. Roasted Hatch Chile Hot Sauce",
      "High Mesa Chili Co. hot sauces are only available through the brand\u2019s website, so they\u2019re not as easily accessible as most of the other options we tested. But our list of favorites felt incomplete without its Roasted Hatch Hot Sauce, which was an overall crowd-pleaser, even among testers who are typically \u201cafraid\u201d to consume spicy foods, like NBC Select SEO editor Nikki Brown. \u201cWhen you taste a bite, the chili hits you hard and fast, but then it tones down,\u201d she says. \u201cThe taste also lingers in my mouth, but not so much that I can\u2019t enjoy the rest of my food.\u201d The hot sauce is made with a variant of Hatch chili called Matador, which High Mesa Chili Co. gets from New Mexico.",
      "This hot sauce is one of the thickest we tried \u2014 many testers compared it to salsa. The only flaw we found was in the packaging. Since the hot sauce is thick, we had to shake the bottle to get it out of the narrow opening, and once it started coming out, it was hard to stop.",
      "Experts-recommended hot sauces",
      "In addition to testing hot sauces, I asked experts to share their favorite options. Here are their top picks.",
      "Marie Sharp's Original Hot Habanero Pepper Sauce",
      "\u201cFar and away, my son and I\u2019s favorite hot sauce is Marie Sharp\u2019s,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cThey\u2019ve figured out the right blend of really spicy and vinegary, and their sauces are carrot-based, so the carrot balances out the pepper. If you\u2019re trying to find a hot sauce you haven\u2019t had before, Marie Sharp\u2019s entire line is really good, but especially the habanero.\u201d",
      "Valentina Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cMost people know Mexican hot sauces like Cholula, Tapatio and El Yucateco, which are all really good, but the real ones know that Valentina is the best,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cIt\u2019s not as spicy as the others, but it\u2019s really flavorful.\u201d Shell agrees \u2014 when people ask him for hot sauce recommendations, his sleeper pick is always Valentina.",
      "Red Clay Original Hot Sauce",
      "\u201cRed Clay\u2019s OG Hot Sauce has a subtle but sufficient fresno chili flavor with a smooth, silky texture to pair with its original purpose, which is oysters,\u201d says Shell. \u201cAll their hot sauces are chef-crafted, fresh and feature almost peculiar ingredients for hot sauce. Their products are never cooked \u2014 instead they use salt and vinegar to ferment the chilis and create a naturally emerged product.\u201d In addition to the brand\u2019s original sauce, Shell recommends their Carolina variety, which he says has a similar consistency to Cholula.",
      "How to shop for hot sauce",
      "Before you start shopping for hot sauce, ask yourself what you want it to add to a dish. \u201cAre you looking for heat or are you looking for flavor?,\u201d says Shell. \u201cSome sauces exist just to make you sweat, and some really compliment food.\u201d Once you identify that, you can start thinking through the factors experts outline below to find a hot sauce you like.",
      "While shopping, remember that flavor and heat are subjective, says Saldivar. What\u2019s spicy or delicious to you may not be to someone else, so testing a bunch of options, pairing them with different foods and regulating how much you use (starting with a couple drops before dousing a meal with it) is key.",
      "Hot sauce gets its spice from the peppers it\u2019s made with. Different types vary in their heat level, which we measure using the Scoville Scale. It\u2019s based on peppers\u2019 concentration of capsaicin, a chemical compound that causes a burning sensation when we consume it, says McManus.",
      "Peppers are rated on their heat level in Scoville heat units (SHU) \u2014 the higher the number on the scale, which ranges from 0 to over 2,000,000 SHU, the hotter the sauce, says Shell. For example, the bell pepper is lowest on the Scoville Scale at 0 SHU, which means it\u2019s not spicy, says McManus. On the other hand, Pepper X is highest on the Scoville Scale at about 2.693 SHU, which means it\u2019s \u201cburn your internal organs\u201d level of spicy.",
      "The Scoville Scale establishes what Plovnick says is a \u201cscientific, universal understanding of a breed of pepper\u201d \u2014 in other words, a pepper\u2019s Scoville rating isn\u2019t subjective, so once it\u2019s assigned a heat level, it\u2019s a widely accepted fact. To determine a pepper\u2019s Scoville rating, food labs conduct a formal test. \u201cIt\u2019s done by  diluting an extract of pepper in sugar water until a panel of trained tasters can no longer detect the heat,\u201d says Shell. \u201cThe number of times it\u2019s diluted dictates the measurement.\u201d",
      "Hot sauces, in addition to the peppers they\u2019re made with, can get Scoville ratings, says McManus. But to do so, brands have to hire third-party labs, which many don\u2019t want to pay for. That\u2019s often why you don\u2019t often see a Scoville rating listed on hot sauce bottles, says Chavez. Plus, the average consumer doesn\u2019t know much about the Scoville Scale, so they can\u2019t use SHU as a reference point.",
      "Instead of a Scoville rating, brands may use a scale of fire illustrations or a thermometer to represent spice, while others label them mild, medium or hot. \u201cUltimately, the biggest giveaway is knowing the type of chili a hot sauce is made with,\u201d says Chavez. You can find that listed on the bottle\u2019s ingredient label and look it up to find its SHU rating before comparing it to the SHU rating of other peppers you know you can tolerate.",
      "A hot sauce\u2019s flavor is dictated by the ingredients it\u2019s made with. The core ingredients are usually peppers, vinegar, salt and alliums like garlic, shallot and onion, says Chavez. From there, brands add other vegetables, fruits and spices in varying amounts, which impact a hot sauce\u2019s overall flavor profile and make each type unique. For example, hot sauces made with fruits usually have a sweet or citrusy flavor, and those made with aromatics like spices and herbs can lean floral, says McManus.",
      "Adding vinegar to hot sauce or fermenting its base are both ways to preserve the condiment, making it shelf-stable before it\u2019s opened so you can find it in the pantry aisle, says Plovnick. Each preservation method creates a different flavor profile, too.",
      "To make fermented hot sauces, some of the most popular being Tabasco and Sriracha, brands ferment chilis by putting them in a salt brine solution before blending them with all the other ingredients. Doing so somewhat cuts the pepper\u2019s heat, making fermented hot sauces typically less spicy than vinegar-based varieties. The fermented chilis give hot sauce a complex, layered, umami flavor similar to what you\u2019d expect from other fermented foods like pickles and kimchi, says Plovnick. Fermented hot sauces usually have vinegar in them, but not as much as vinegar-based hot sauces.",
      "Vinegar-based hot sauces, like Cholula, aren\u2019t made with fermented chilis. Instead, they fully rely on vinegar for preservation, says Plovnick. These hot sauces tend to have a bright, sharp, sour and tangy flavor, plus they\u2019re usually spicier than fermented hot sauces.",
      "Not all hot sauces are created equal. Some are thin and runny, some are semi-gritty and paste-like, or thick and pourable, says McManus. Texture and consistency are personal preferences, and often, what you\u2019re putting the hot sauce on guides your picks. For example, I prefer topping a bowl of fried rice with a thick Sriracha drizzle, adding flavor and a picturesque finishing touch, but I like to shake a couple drops of runny Tabasco on chicken wings since it\u2019s thin enough to blend into the sauce they\u2019re coated in.",
      "There are no hard-and-fast rules around which hot sauces you should pair with specific foods \u2014 ultimately, go with whatever you think tastes good. But traditionally, Plovnick recommends pairing vinegar-based hot sauces with fattier, richer foods, like a breakfast plate with scrambled eggs, hash browns and sausage. \u201cVinegar-based hot sauces will cut through some of that fat and make it easier to eat it all,\u201d he says. On the other hand, fermented hot sauces tend to best compliment meats, fishes and marinades. \u201cFermented hot sauces have more aromatics so they have more depth of flavor, yet they won\u2019t overpower these foods with vinegar,\u201d says Plovnick.",
      "Frequently asked questions",
      "A hot sauce\u2019s color is dependent on the color of the pepper it\u2019s made with. \u201cRight off the bat, red tells you it\u2019s going to be fiery hot,\u201d says Chavez. \u201cGreen usually isn\u2019t as spicy, and the color either comes from not as ripened chilis, or peppers like green jalape\u00f1os or serranos.\u201d",
      "Store hot sauce according to the directions printed on the bottle, says Shell. Most hot sauces are cooked prior to being bottled, and those need to be refrigerated once you open them. Hot sauces that are exclusively fermented, however, are typically shelf-stable for up to a year after opening them, although there\u2019s no harm in refrigerating them if you prefer, he says.",
      "If the brand recommends refrigerating its hot sauce once you open it, don\u2019t be worried about the cold environment diluting its flavor or heat, says Chavez. Just take it out of the fridge about 30 minutes before use so it comes to room temperature, letting you taste its full heat and flavor profile.",
      "Yes, hot sauce expires. Most options have an expiration date printed on their packaging, which you should follow. If unopened, hot sauces usually last about two years in a cool, dark place, experts told me.",
      "We\u2019ve all been there: you take a bite of food that\u2019s way too spicy and instantly jump into panic mode because your mouth is on fire. But don\u2019t reach for a glass of water, says Saldivar. The best way to neutralize spice is to drink milk or eat a dairy-based product like yogurt and cheese. He also recommends eating bread, which decreases the burning sensation in your mouth and on your tongue, and squeezing lemon or lime in your mouth, which neutralizes the spice.",
      "Beyond water, you also shouldn\u2019t drink alcohol right after eating something spicy. Alcohol amplifies spice, says Saldivar.",
      "If you\u2019re new to hot sauce, and/or spicy food in general, Saldivar recommends starting with mild varieties and working your way up to hotter options over time. The more you eat hot sauce, the more your body can tolerate it and more you can add to your food. On the other hand, if you stop eating hot sauce (and/or spicy foods) for a prolonged period, your tolerance can reverse, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s like training for a marathon, then doing the race and then stopping running,\u201d says Saldivar.",

    "story": [
      "Sean 'Diddy' Combs' request for an acquittal or a new trial should be quickly rejected, prosecutors said in a new court filing almost three weeks after the music mogul was convicted of two charges related to prostitution.",
      "In a filing made public just before midnight on Wednesday, prosecutors said there were no legal grounds for the court to grant Combs' request to quash his convictions and that he should be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "Combs, 55, was acquitted of the more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking at his lengthy and high-profile, seven-week trial in New York last month. At the time, Lead attorney Marc Agnifilo called the verdict \"a great victory for Sean Combs.\"",
      "But the convictions against him on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution could see him jailed for up to 20 years under the Mann Act, which outlaws interstate commerce related to prostitution. U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian said after the trial that prosecutors would seek a sentence of between 4 and 5 years behind bars.",
      "Combs was denied bail and has remained in jail since the trial, as his defense team continues to argue that he should serve no time.",
      "In previous legal filings, Combs' lawyers have argued that the Mann Act is vague and violates his First Amendment rights. None of the elements generally used in a Mann Act conviction were present in this case, they argued, including that Combs had no financial motive. Instead, he had \"paid to engage in voyeurism as part of a \u2018swingers\u2019 lifestyle,\" the filings said.",
      "Prosecutors, however, argue that not only was the Mann Act clear and relevant to this case, but there was \"overwhelming\" evidence to support his conviction, centered on the now well-known \"freak offs\" and \"hotel nights,\" drug-fueled sex parties in luxury hotels that involved male sex workers.",
      "\"The defendant masterminded every aspect of Freak Offs,\" the prosecution said in its U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York filing.",
      "\"He transported escorts across state lines to engage in Freak Offs for pay. He directed the sexual activity of escorts and victims throughout Freak Offs for his own sexual gratification. And he personally engaged in sexual activity during Freak Offs,\" the filing said.",
      "NBC News has contacted Combs's attorneys for comment but had not received a response by the time of publication.",
      "The case against Combs fell apart in court despite the years-long efforts of federal prosecutors to build evidence to prove the sex trafficking charges against him. More than 30 prosecution witnesses were called in total, while the defense called none.",
      "During the trial, the jury was shown harrowing video evidence showing him assaulting R&B artist Cassie, a former girlfriend whose real name is Casandra Ventura, in a Los Angeles hotel hallway in 2016. Ventura told the trial that Combs was angered that she had decided to leave a freak off."

    "story": [
      "Between tears and anger, mothers and fathers of children who died at Camp Mystic in central Texas in a flood on July 4 pleaded with state lawmakers Wednesday to toughen safety at summer camps.",
      "One by one, the parents proudly described their young children\u2019s personalities, quirks and achievements before they shared their nightmare of grief, guilt and loss through tears and sobs. But they also admonished lawmakers to approve a series of reforms that could prevent such a tragedy from happening again.",
      "Their heartbreaking testimony in the bicameral committee hearing also led some senators to cry.",
      "Among the parents who testified were the mother and father of Cile Steward, the only girl still missing out of 27 children and counselors who died at the girls' camp when the Guadalupe River overflowed several feet in a matter of hours, sweeping through wooded summer camps, homes and businesses.",
      "A total of 120 people were killed in Kerr County, including those from Camp Mystic.",
      "Cile's mother, CiCi Williams Steward, told the lawmakers she had been assured that the safety of the girls at Camp Mystic was paramount. But that assurance was \u201cbetrayed\u201d by obvious and commonsense safety measures and protocols that were absent or ignored, she said.",
      "\u201cAs a result, my daughter was stolen from us not because of an unavoidable act of nature, but because of preventable failures,\u201d she said through tears. \u201cCile remains somewhere in the devastation of the Guadalupe River. We remain trapped in agony until she is brought home.\u201d",
      "Reforms proposed in legislation that the committee approved on a voice vote and that the Senate is expected to consider Thursday night \u201cmust occur so this tragedy never happens again,\u201d Williams Steward said. Separate legislation is being drafted to address warning systems and disaster response.",
      "All of the parents who testified and a handful of owners of other camps along the Guadalupe River said they support the disaster preparedness bill. The legislation has been dubbed the \u201cHeaven\u2019s 27 Camp Safety Act.\"",
      "\u201cHad the requirements of SB 1 been in place on July 4, I have no doubt that some lives, if not all lives, would have been saved,\u201d said the committee\u2019s chairman, Charles Perry, a Republican.",
      "The legislation would apply to all campgrounds, and it would be more stringent for youth camps, the Senate said in a statement.",
      "Some of the measures the legislation calls for include a requirement that camps file comprehensive emergency plans for natural disasters and that cabins in flood plains have rooftop exits, as well as fire emergency plans, the statement said.",
      "The camps would also have to conduct evacuation drills with campers, and staff members would have to undergo annual training, the Senate said.",
      "The legislation would require emergency evacuations to higher ground when a flood warning is issued for an area.",
      "Camp Mystic said in a statement Wednesday that it could not comment on specific legislation because it was focused on recovery, but it \"supports legislative efforts that will make camps and communities along the Guadalupe River safer.\"",
      "\"The safety and well-being of every camper is our priority, and our policies and practices are designed to ensure a safe and supportive environment,\" it said.",
      "The parents, including some whose family members had attended Camp Mystic over generations, repeatedly criticized its operators while also saying they love the camp and want camps to continue, albeit with many more safety measures in place.",
      "\u201cCamp Mystic was completely unprepared for the flooding that cost my daughter her life,\" said Davin Hunt, father of Janie Hunt, 9, a relative of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt. \"Since that day, our life has been a living nightmare.\u201d",
      "Davin Hunt said his daughter\u2019s death left him with gut-wrenching dreams, when he can sleep, that sometimes depict a trip to the funeral home, where he prays, \u201cLord and Savior, please kill me; take my life, not my daughter, Janie.\"",
      "A few parents expressed anger about having learned after their children\u2019s deaths that some of the Camp Mystic structures had been removed from 100-year flood maps, allowing for exemptions from some regulations.",
      "\u201cWe feel guilty because we sent our girls to a camp we thought was safe,\u201d said Doug Hanna, father of Hadley, who he said was 8 years, 4 months and 22 days old. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, we love camp. ... We thought Camp Mystic was safe. We didn\u2019t know we were sending our daughters to sleep in cabins that were removed from the flood plain through an administrative process.\u201d",
      "Speaking about the changes the bill proposes, Perry said such exemptions or carve-outs would no longer be allowed.",
      "\u201cNo more waivers. Just, in a nutshell, don\u2019t ask for them,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are a camp owner seeking a waiver, don\u2019t come to the state seeking waivers. You\u2019re not going to get them.\u201d",
      "The parents repeatedly said that the testimony and any legislation approved would not relieve their grief but that they hoped it would help other parents.",
      "Brent Dillon, father of Lucy Dillon, 8, urged the lawmakers to ensure that when parents entrust their children to camps they are sending them to safe camps, where operators are prepared and emergency plans are sufficient, executable and enforceable.",
      "\u201cToday I sit before you a broken man. When Lucy left for camp, it was the very first time she had ever slipped away from us,\u201d Dillon said. \u201cWe entrusted her to the camp operators, and never for a moment did we believe she would return to us in a casket.\u201d"

      "Now, Manganiello appears to be in his hosting era. In addition to hosting NBC\u2019s \u201cDeal or No Deal Island,\u201d he\u2019s now airing out his passion for theme parks as host of the network\u2019s one-hour special called \u201cInside the Worlds of Epic Universe.\u201d",
      "The program, which premieres on NBC Aug. 20 at 9 p.m. ET and streams on Peacock the next day, explores the five worlds that make up Universal Epic Universe at Universal Orlando Resort: Celestial Park, Super Nintendo World, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter\u2014Ministry of Magic, How to Train Your Dragon\u2014Isle of Berk and Dark Universe.",
      "Ahead of the theme park's May 22 opening date, Manganiello sat down with TODAY.com while filming at Epic Universe to talk about his multifaceted identity and career, and how his worlds have collided.",
      "Universal and Peacock are part of our parent company, NBCUniversal. This interview was condensed and edited for clarity.",
      "So, you\u2019re here filming the Epic Universe TV special. Tell me about your involvement in it.",
      "Well, I'm assuming because I'm an NBCUniversal employee that I got asked to host and launch the special for the park, which is super cool, so I get to see it first. And then, you know, hanging out with some of the actors, some of the projects, Warwick Davis from \"Harry Potter,\" the two stars of \"How to Train Your Dragon\" came by.",
      "Toothless?",
      "The actors. Well, no, then we get to go see Toothless, which is nuts. That animatronic dragon, it's crazy. And you scratch his chin and he starts, like, kind of purring and growling.",
      "We're not used to being able to engage in technology like that on our own.",
      "It was like those robots in, like, the Hall of Presidents (at Disney World). And now it's like, yeah, it's pretty amazing. And even in the Dark Universe ride (Monsters Unchained), all those animatronic creatures were incredible. Frankenstein, it's nuts.",
      "So yeah, it's been super fun to get to do all of that. You revert (back to) childhood when you do it, you do start thinking what you would think as a kid. And yeah, kind of having your mind blown and seeing all this stuff for real, and being able to walk around inside of it. It's pretty incredible.",
      "What childhood memories have been coming back to you?",
      "I was on \"True Blood\" for so many years as a werewolf. And I do think the kid that I was manifested that for me as an adult, because Halloween was always the big holiday for me, and my mom would make me costumes and things. So, you know, I dressed up like Dracula as a kid and in your mind, when you're a little kid, you're pretending that you're a vampire. And I remember my parents taking me to a haunted house when I was little, and I guess there was a Dracula that popped out of a coffin, and I was dressed as Dracula, so I walked up to the coffin and put my hands up, and he picked me up and put me in the coffin and closed it with me in it.",
      "What?! Were you freaked out?",
      "No, I'm a vampire, this is a vampire! So you're like, \"This is what I'm supposed to do,\" yeah, like, I was in character as a little kid, I knew, like, \"Why am I afraid? I'm going to go live with the vampires.\"",
      "That's very brave for a kid.",
      "You're being very diplomatic. But that's the thing: I think as a kid, you know ... I think it was a Val Kilmer quote where he said, \"Kids dream of being Batman, not the guy in the Batman suit, not the actor in the Batman suit.\" And so there's a bit of, you know, I never dreamed of being an actor playing a werewolf. I dreamed of being a werewolf. So here, you get to walk around and pretend that maybe you are in that medieval village, this Gothic, Romanian village.",
      "You brought your dog, Bubbles, through Dark Universe last night. Do you dress your dog up for Halloween?",
      "This past year, I dressed her up for Cinco de Mayo. OK, she's a Chihuahua, so we celebrate Cinco de Mayo. ... The year before, we were actually in Firenze, Italy, for Halloween, and we had a little dragon costume that we put on her with little flappy wings. ... People send me all kinds of things. I think there's, like, an avocado costume in the closet. She was a bat one year \u2014 cool, flappy wings.",
      "Another thing that I know that is important to you is your ancestry. You were on \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d in 2023.",
      "I actually got the results the year before that. It took them a year because I made some discoveries during that year that then pushed the episode to the following season.",
      "I want to be clear also that, because of my mother\u2019s side of the family, I\u2019ve been interested in genealogy from a young age because of the Armenian German component that I knew about. I grew up knowing I was Armenian, I knew that I was German, but didn\u2019t know how or from who, and that\u2019s what led me to apply (to \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d) and it took 10 years. And finally, they got to the point where they thought, \u201cYeah, it was going to work.\u201d The technology just wasn\u2019t there, and they thought they were going to run into roadblocks because the Armenian genocide. ... And then finally, after 10 years, their team thought, \u201cOK, I think science is at the place where we have access to enough databases that we think we could do something. So let\u2019s try.\u201d And so they actually came back after about six months and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be able to do it,\u201d but then a month later, they made a breakthrough and then they said it\u2019s on.",
      "Wow.",
      "And then they called me back about a month after that, and gave me the option of ducking out of the episode, of opting out of the episode because of the paternity issue involving my father\u2019s side. They can\u2019t reveal paternity issues unless there\u2019s consent and knowledge by all parties involved, and because my father\u2019s still alive and he needed to be informed if we were going to move forward to reveal potentially who his father was. So then that blew open, that was the big discovery that then blew open my father\u2019s side of the family tree.",
      "It\u2019s been three years since I got those results, and I\u2019ve had multiple historians on payroll running down loose ends. I found my German family members, there was part of the German family living in Canada, and I got in contact with them and they had a handwritten German family tree that went back to the 1400s. I got hooked up with a historian in Germany, went and ran all of it down, and I found my ancestors that fought in the Napoleonic wars. There\u2019s a famous architect, a mayor in the town where they all came from. Then I have another historian that specializes in New England and Virginia, and he\u2019s been working for the past two years, unraveling all of that, and dipped into my Irish ancestry. My great-great-grandfather came over during the potato famine, joined the Union Army and fought in the American Civil War and disappeared somewhere out West shortly thereafter. I\u2019m actually going to go from here to New England for my cousin\u2019s wedding, and I\u2019m going to go to the memorial and grave marker of my fifth great-grandfather (Plato Turner), an African slave who fought in the American Revolution against the British.",
      "And then, about a year and a half ago, I got a ping on 23andMe that my father has a half sister living in Ohio. That same biological grandfather had another child eight years later, so I got to meet her and I have a half aunt living in Ohio.",
      "It keeps going.",
      "So the talk with \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d is about doing their first-ever sequel episode, because also finding her then proved without a shadow of a doubt who my biological grandfather was. I left \u201cFinding Your Roots\u201d not knowing definitely who my biological grandfather was, but her DNA proved it, so we know it was this man. Then I did some digging and found a marriage certificate from the 1800s that proves where my European Y chromosome cut ... which also proves what I think my last name is because there were multiple, but I need to go on the show (again) to test some people genetically. We\u2019re putting together a kind of rogues\u2019 gallery of people\u2019s genes we want to test to see if I match their Y chromosome, and then there\u2019s a village on the border of Wales and England where I think my last name comes from ... anyway.",
      "I struck a chord. Thank you for sharing all that.",
      "Don\u2019t get me started, I know."

As soon as she arrives at Top of the Rock\u2019s terrace, Amaya finds the free-use binoculars. She fiddles with the machine before stepping up on a circular ledge for a better view, and her heels dangle from the few inches of extra height as she takes in her hometown. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s having a moment, and when she catches me and a few others watching, her surprise shifts to laughter and a wide, open smile.",
      "Throughout Season 7, Amaya \u2014 who entered the show as a bombshell in Episode 4 \u2014 quickly became a fan-favorite, known for hyping herself up through impromptu songs and memorable mantras. A fan favorite: \u201cI feel free! I feel like I could fly! Like the pigeons back in New York City!\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Amanda Knox's wrongful murder conviction in Italy is back in the spotlight as a new Hulu limited series, \"The Twisted Tale of Amanda Knox\" premieres on Aug. 20.",
      "Grace Van Patten portrays Knox in the eight-episode series, in which Knox is an executive producer alongside her husband, Christopher Robinson, and Monica Lewinsky.",
      "The series starts with Knox\u2019s arrival in Italy, and spans to her eventual return in 2022. Knox, now 38, tells TODAY.com there isn't anything in the series she's apprehensive about or embarrassed for audiences to see.",
      "\"We start it with two young girls go to study abroad in Perugia, Italy, and it's a beautiful experience,\" Knox says. \"They have the whole world ahead of them. That's who I was, and that's who Meredith was.\"",
      "\"And then we have this traumatic thing happened, and only one of us gets to survive the journey,\" she adds. \"And how do I carry her alongside me as I try to make sense of this traumatic thing? I think that was a really important part of our trying to do justice to something that had been a story that has been so misrepresented and so exploited.\"",
      "What has Knox done since she was released from prison in 2011? Keep reading to find out more about Knox's life, including her books, children and involvement in the Innocence Project.",
      "What happened to Amanda Knox in Italy?",
      "Knox was accused of killing her roommate, Meredith Kercher, in 2007 when the pair were studying abroad in Perugia, Italy.",
      "Knox and her then-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, were found guilty of murder in 2009, though both Knox and Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in 2015.",
      "Rudy Guede, a man whose bloody fingerprints and DNA were found at the crime scene, was convicted of murder in 2007 and was released from prison in 2021 after serving 13 years of his 16-year sentence, according to the Associated Press.",
      "Knox, Sollecito and Guede have all denied any involvement in the British study abroad student\u2019s murder.",
      "What happened when Amanda Knox was released from prison?",
      "Knox served about four years in prison before she was acquitted of Kercher's murder in 2011, an experience she recounted in her memoir, \"Waiting to Be Heard,\" which was published in 2015.",
      "After her release from prison, Knox returned to her hometown of Seattle, where she completed her bachelor's degree in creative writing from the University of Washington in 2014, according to Time.",
      "However, Knox's legal troubles didn't end in 2011, when her acquittal was annulled and sent to a lower court for further proceedings, according to NBC News. In 2014, she was convicted again in Kercher's murder, though the Italian Supreme Court overturned the conviction in 2015, NBC News reported.",
      "Knox has returned to Italy several times since she was exonerated, including when she traveled back to Perugia to come face to face with the prosecutor in her first trial, Giuliano Mignini.",
      "She also met up with Sollecito in 2022 and the pair went to Gubbio, the Italian city that they planned to visit on the day Kercher was found dead, according to The Daily Mirror.",
      "\u201cIt was bittersweet to go back as we were supposed to go there in such different circumstances, but it was just nice for us to be able to talk about something that wasn\u2019t the case,\u201d Sollecito told the Mirror.",
      "Knox returned to Italy again and stood in an Italian courtroom once again in an attempt to clear her name in 2024. While her murder conviction had been overturned, a slander conviction still remained on her record from when she says she was coerced by investigators into wrongly accusing bar owner Patrick Lumumba of taking part in Kercher\u2019s murder.",
      "Lumumba was jailed for several weeks before he was released due to a lack of evidence, according to NBC News.",
      "The court reconvicted Knox of slander on June 5, 2024, and Knox wiped away tears in the courtroom.",
      "\u201cAmanda\u2019s very upset,\u201d Knox\u2019s attorney Carlo Dalla Vedova told NBC News after the verdict. \u201cWe were very surprised by the outcome of the decision.\u201d",
      "Where is Amanda Knox now?",
      "Knox lives in the Seattle area with her husband, Christopher Robinson. Knox and Robinson met in 2015 at Robinson's book launch party after Knox wrote a review of his book for the West Seattle Herald.",
      "\u201cI was probably the only person at the party who didn\u2019t really know who she was,\u201d Robinson told People in 2017. \u201cI knew (about) Italy and some legal stuff and something that shouldn\u2019t have happened. But I didn\u2019t really know her story.\u201d",
      "The pair married in 2020 in a space-themed wedding, Knox said in an Instagram post at the time.",
      "Knox and Robinson share two children together: a daughter, Eureka, born in 2021, and a son, Echo, born in 2023.",
      "The couple also co-host the \"Labyrinths\" podcast together, and Knox hosts several other podcasts like \"Hard Knox With Amanda Knox\" and more.",
      "Knox also published another book, \u201cFree: My Search For Meaning,\u201d earlier this year.",
      "Knox told TODAY.com she is an ambassador for the Innocence Network and attends the network's conference every year, which brings together people who work to free the innocent, prevent wrongful conviction and provide post-release support, according to the network's website."

      "\"We get to North Carolina (to film the series) and we put the wig on, and it fits great and whatever, but it's not quite the color or the shape that we had talked about,\" she continued.",
      "The Swedish-born actor recalled showrunner Rebecca Cutter frowning when she saw her model the wig for producers. \u00c5kerman agreed the wig's throwback 1980s look wasn't right for wealthy wild child Margo.",
      "\"It looked a little bit like I had walked out of 'Dallas' or 'Dynasty,'\" she joked.",
      "A stylist for the show took \u00c5kerman back to a trailer where they searched through a \"box of wigs.\"",
      "The pair found another wig that wasn't the right size for \u00c5kerman. \"But the color is good and it's really long, and we can do something with it,\" she said.",
      "\"Anyway, that ended up being the wig that we had to go with because we had no time to make a new one,\" she explained, adding that it \"takes weeks\" to create a proper wig.",
      "That second wig was then sent to a wigmaker to be sized for \u00c5kerman. \"But when it came (back), it was a different color,\" the actor recalled, laughing.",
      "\u00c5kerman said a scene was added to the series that showed Margo getting her hair colored as her husband, Jed (Dermot Mulroney), gears up to run for governor.",

      "The series's behind-the-scenes wig dramas were no big deal to \u00c5kerman.",
      "\"It happens,\" she said.",
      "As for why she didn't opt to simply dye her own hair to play Margo, \u00c5kerman explained that because of a thyroid issue, her \"hair quality\" at the time \"wasn't great.\"",
      "\"So thinking of like dyeing it and putting extensions in and stuff, it was just going to start falling out,\" said \u00c5kerman.",
      "\"If we get a second season,\" she added, \"we're going to go with the dyeing.\""

      "In his closing argument, lead prosecutor Giuliano Mignini claimed Knox tried to strangle Kercher. Prosecutors said a knife with Knox\u2019s DNA on the handle was found at Sollecito\u2019s house, while the defense argued that the knife in question did not match Kercher\u2019s stab wounds, according to NBC News.",

      "In a second trial in Italy in 2011, Knox and Sollecito appealed their initial convictions. They were both acquitted and freed, and Knox returned to the U.S. By that time, she had spent about four years in prison in Italy.",
      "Then, in 2013, Knox\u2019s acquittal was overturned by the Italian Court of Cassation, the equivalent of the Supreme Court, and she faced a retrial for Kercher\u2019s murder, according to NBC News.",

I thought about what it would be like to live my entire life in prison and to lose everything, to lose what I\u2019ve been able to come back to and rebuild,\u201d she told TODAY in September 2013. \u201cI think about it all the time. It\u2019s so scary. Everything\u2019s at stake.\u201d",
      "In 2014, Knox and Sollecito were convicted again of Kercher\u2019s murder. Knox remained in the U.S. and was sentenced in absentia to 28 \u00bd years in prison, while Sollecito was sentenced to 25 years.",

      "Knox spoke to the media in front of her parents\u2019 Seattle home on March 27, 2015, after her exoneration.",
      "However, her legal battles in Italy were not completely over. Even after her murder charges were overturned, the slander conviction she had received for wrongly implicating Lumumba in the killing remained on her record.",
      "In 2024, an Italian court reconvicted Knox of slander and sentenced her to three years in prison. She did not return to jail, however, as the new sentence counted as time already served, NBC News reported.",
      "\u201cThe irony is that while being wrongly convicted of slander, I\u2019m the most slandered person in this whole saga,\u201d Knox wrote on X in January 2025 after an Italian court upheld the slander conviction.",
      "\u201cThe police, prosecutor, media, courts, and the killer Rudy Guede, have all slandered me to no end,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Why was her conviction overturned?",
      "Knox and Sollecito\u2019s convictions were overturned due to \u201cglaring errors\u201d in the investigation of Kercher\u2019s murder, Italy\u2019s highest court said in 2015, according to NBC News.",
      "In a written opinion, the Italian court said no biological evidence of Knox or Sollecito had been found at the scene of the crime, while the third person convicted, Rudy Guede, had left \u201ccopious\u201d biological evidence.",
      "The court also accused police and prosecutors of \u201cstunning weakness\u201d and \u201cinvestigative bouts of amnesia,\u201d and accused authorities of bowing to public pressure to find \u201cone or more guilty parties to offer up to international public opinion.\u201d",
      "In the 2013 retrial, a forensic expert testified that the knife that had allegedly been used in the crime had no traces of Kercher\u2019s DNA on it.",
      "Experts also claimed that a material found on the blade of the knife in question was starch, not blood, according to NBC News.",
      "Forensic experts also testified that investigators may have contaminated pieces of evidence by using the same gloves to handle different items, and failed to properly document and analyze DNA evidence in the aftermath of the crime, NBC News reported.",
      "Where is she now?",
      "Today, Knox is a writer, public speaker and podcast host who advocates for wrongfully incarcerated people. She has opened up about her experiences in two memoirs, 2013\u2019s \u201cWaiting to Be Heard\u201d and 2025\u2019s\u201cFree: My Search for Meaning.\u201d",
      "Knox spoke at the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books on April 26, 2025.",

      "She is also involved with multiple organizations fighting for criminal justice reform, including the Frederick Douglass Project for Justice and The Innocence Center, according to herofficial website.",
      "Knox has also hosted multiple podcasts about wrongful conviction, justice reform, and resilience, including \u201cLabyrinths\u201d and \u201cHard Knox.\u201d",
      "Knox married writer and podcast host Christopher Robinson in 2020.",
      "\u201cChris and I have been married now for as long as I was imprisoned, and together for as long as I was on trial,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post on Feb. 29, 2024, celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary.",
      "\u201cHe has balanced the scales of my life away from injustice and pain and towards love and hope,\u201d she continued. \u201cChoosing him as my person was the best decision I\u2019ve ever made.\u201d",
      "In October 2021, Knox revealed that she and her husband had welcomed their first child, Eureka Muse Knox-Robinson, months earlier. She said she initially kept her daughter\u2019s birth private because she was \u201cstill nervous about the paparazzi bounty on her head,\u201d she told The New York Times.",
      "Knox and Robinson also welcomed a son, Echo, in September 2023.",
      "In 2019, the couple bought a home on Vashon Island near Seattle. Residents of the small island community were supportive of her and her family, starting a Facebook group called \u201cFriends of Amanda,\u201d Knox told the Mercer Island Reporter in 2022.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been nice being part of a small community as opposed to singled out under a harsh, international spotlight,\u201d she said."

      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy urged swift progress  as military officials from the U.S. and Europe meet. Ukraine wanted to \"have an understanding of the security guarantees architecture within seven to 10 days,\" Zelenskyy told reporters in Kyiv on Wednesday.",
      "After Russia launched one of its biggest aerial attacks of the year overnight, he said Thursday that there was \"still no signal from Moscow that they truly intend to engage in substantive negotiations and end this war.\u201d",
      "Later, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov reiterated his government's longstanding demands that Ukraine be demilitarized and stop trying to be allied with the West.",
      "\"Ukraine would remain neutral, non-nuclear and non-aligned,\" Lavrov said during a news conference. He suggested that a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting depended on addressing these demands in advance, and accused Kyiv and its allies of undermining Trump's efforts to secure a peace deal.",
      "\"The goals pursued by the current Ukrainian leadership \u2014  goals that are undoubtedly fueled by the Western sponsors of the Kyiv regime \u2014 are directed against the efforts being made by President Trump,\" he said.",
      "Trump has promised European leaders that the U.S. would help provide security guarantees in any settlement with Russia, a key concern for Kyiv. He has since made clear that this would not include U.S. troops on the ground, but might involve air support.",
      "Once Kyiv has more clarity on what protections its allies are willing to offer, Zelenskyy said, he would then be ready to meet with Russia's Vladimir Putin. And if Putin was not ready to meet, he said he \u201cwould like to see a strong reaction from the United States.\"",
      "Where those talks might place has emerged as a possible stumbling block.",
      "The White House has pressed ahead with making arrangements despite some public reticence from the Kremlin. Hungarian capital Budapest and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites being discussed, a senior administration official told NBC News, as Washington sought to secure a location and date.",
      "But Zelenskyy said Wednesday that Budapest would be a \u201cchallenging\u201d venue for his first direct talks with his Russian counterpart since the Kremlin launched its full-scale invasion.",
      "The meeting should take place in a neutral European country, he said, pointing to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's close ties to the Kremlin and lack of support for Kyiv.",
      "\u201cSwitzerland, Austria \u2014 we agree,\u201d Zelenskyy told reporters, adding that Ukraine would also accept Turkey.",
      "Russia on Wednesday signaled it was in no hurry for Putin and Zelenskyy to sit down together, with Lavrov saying \u201ctalks must be prepared with the utmost care.\u201d",
      "Adding to this apparent lack of urgency in talks, Russia launched a massive aerial bombardment overnight that included nearly 600 drones and 40 missiles, Ukraine's air force said early Thursday.",
      "The strikes reached deep inside Ukraine, hitting an American business in the Western region of Zakarpattia, Zelenskyy said, and injuring at least 15 employees. At least one person was killed and two others were injured in Lviv as dozens of residential buildings were destroyed, governor Maksym Kozytskyy wrote on Telegram.",
      "\"The Russians carried out this attack as if nothing has changed at all, as if there are no global efforts to stop this war,\" Zelenskyy said on X.",

      "StarBot\u2019s machines, developed based on the Chinese-made Unitree model, competed in service-related races, as they excel at restaurant scenarios such as taking orders and delivering food to tables, he said.",
      "Going forward, Velasco said, \u201cwe hope to be in people\u2019s homes and restaurants, hotels, and I think in the future, many people will have robots involved in their life.\u201d",
      "The venue was packed with spectators who laughed, clapped and rooted for the robot athletes as the games kicked off Friday.",
      "During the tai chi event, a group of judges watched carefully as the robot competitors moved gracefully to the rhythm of soft music in the background, jotting down notes and scoring the performances with the seriousness of an Olympic panel.",
      "\u201cFor robots, a single movement needs to be repeated many times before they can perform it with stability,\u201d martial arts judge Zhang Jidong told Chinese state newspaper The Beijing News. \u201cConsidering the very short preparation time, the robots\u2019 upper-body movements were impressively smooth.\u201d",
      "The games didn\u2019t just showcase how far robotics have come and how humanoids might one day be integrated into daily life. They also revealed how heavily China\u2019s government has been backing the development of such technologies, to close the artificial intelligence gap with the United States.",
      "In July, China announced its global action plan for AI just days after the Trump administration released the U.S. version, which experts note is \u201cno coincidence\u201d as the two countries race to win others over to their respective visions for AI governance. Both countries consider AI a national security issue, and the United States has sought to restrict China\u2019s access to the advanced semiconductor chips needed to train AI models.",
      "While the United States backs market-driven AI in alignment with liberal norms, China promises to help developing countries with AI as a means to promote state control, according to the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Videos of robots dancing, punching and performing have been all over Chinese social media and state TV as Beijing has deepened its AI investment and promotion. In April, the Chinese government organized a half-marathon in Beijing in which robots and human runners raced one another.",
      "For years, Beijing has been funneling tens of billions of dollars into AI research and state subsidies, just as it did with the electric vehicle industry, drawing accusations of unfair competition from Western critics.",
      "While American robot developers such as Boston Dynamics still dominate high-end research and innovation, Chinese companies, spurred by government policy, are focused on mass-producing affordable robots, according to the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank based in Washington.",
      "Research published by Morgan Stanley predicts that by 2050, China will have 302.3 million humanoid robots in use, well ahead of the U.S. projection of just 77.7 million.",
      "Although the production disparity between the two countries may grow larger, experts said the United States will maintain its advantage in total compute capacity, a metric more likely to be the key in deploying and integrating AI systems at scale.",
      "Wang Xiaoyin, a representative from the China-based robot developer NexAurora, said robots today still lack a \u201crobust AI brain.\u201d",
      "The \u201creal AI age,\u201d he said, will begin only when robots like the ones competing in Beijing can think and behave independently after training.",
      "While the robots\u2019 performance over the weekend showed that day is still a long way off, the games were part of China\u2019s larger goal: getting ahead in the global race for AI domination, one clunky step at a time.",

      "Known as minidramas, micro dramas or vertical dramas, they are soap operas condensed into a minute or two per episode.",
      "Each show, reminiscent of a telenovela, is divided into dozens of chapters, each about two minutes long and with all the soapy elements: cheesy romance, over-the-top drama and abundant cliff-hangers.",
      "\u201cThe revenge ones, oh, my God, they\u2019re so good,\u201d California-based retail business owner Jacarius Murphy told NBC News in a video interview.",
      "Murphy is a fan of the minidramas, known as duanju in Chinese, which focus heavily on romance, revenge and fantasy. The stories tend to involve wealthy characters such as a chief executive who\u2019s secretly a vampire or a billionaire living a double life \u2014 characters often played by American actors.",
      "\u201cPeople want this fast dopamine hit, and they can snack on it while they\u2019re waiting,\u201d said Anina Net, an American actor based in Los Angeles who has worked on minidramas for the past four years.",
      "The genre originated in China, where production companies have tapped into the popularity of short-form, vertical-produced, TikTok-style video content. About half of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people consume dramas in this style, according to a report released in March by the state-owned China Netcasting Services Association.",
      "The industry made $6.9 billion in revenue last year, more than China\u2019s total box office sales.",
      "The shows are \u201cstill quite limited in genre, mostly romance-focused, with sweet, domineering CEO tropes and modern settings,\u201d said Kaidi Dai, a Shanghai-based minidrama producer.",
      "Now, having figured out the Chinese market, the same companies are expanding into the U.S., where minidramas are finding success just a few years after the failure of Quibi, a short-lived, short-form mobile streaming service. The shows are available on platforms such as ReelShort, DramaBox and GoodShort, which offers free episodes and in-app purchases, as well as subscriptions.",
      "Minidramas cost far less to make than standard TV shows and can make millions of dollars in revenue through a combination of user purchases and advertising. But adapting them to the U.S. market takes some tweaking, said Chinese filmmaker Gao Feng, also known as Frank Tian, who has a minidrama production company based in New York.",
      "Rather than remaking Chinese shows, his company hired longtime U.S. residents to craft stories that would appeal to American audiences.",
      "\u201cI believe that scripts determine 65-70% of a project\u2019s success,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cApart from werewolves, CEO romances and hidden identities, we should explore new genres.\u201d",
      "While many short dramas have been based on successful Chinese stories, \u201cif a platform cannot innovate continuously, it will face significant challenges,\u201d he added.",
      "Among the most popular shows is \u201cThe Double Life of My Billionaire Husband,\u201d which tells the story of a woman whose husband is better off financially than he appears. All 60 episodes can be viewed in less than 70 minutes on ReelShort, the California-based, Chinese-backed minidrama platform that released it in 2023.",

      "\u201cThe short videos on TikTok have laid a solid foundation for the popularity of short dramas,\u201d Yan Min, who helped organize an industry conference in China last year, said in an interview.",
      "Min said ReelShort and other companies were advertising on platforms such as YouTube and TikTok to attract new users, catering to the \u201cevolving viewing habits of younger generations, who have grown up with platforms like TikTok and are accustomed to short, engaging content.\u201d",
      "U.S. entertainment companies have taken notice of the trend. Netflix said in May that it was testing a vertical feed made up of clips from its shows and movies, while Disney said last month that it was investing in DramaBox through its accelerator program.",
      "Though minidramas seeking U.S. audiences are increasingly using actors with American backgrounds, they often shoot in scenic Chinese locations like the coastal city of Qingdao, with its Western-style villas and architecture, for greater authenticity.",
      "\u201cWe seek actors and screenwriters who grew up in the U.S. and naturally embody an American style. Then we incorporate some Chinese elements,\u201d said Ann An, a Beijing-based freelance producer for several minidramas made for foreign audiences.",
      "Turnarounds are incredibly fast in the industry as producers strive to keep costs low. An said a show can finish filming in 10 days, with a budget of under $70,000.",
      "The biggest key to the success of minidramas, though, is the cliff-hangers, which push viewers to keep paying for the next episode.",
      "\u201cThe scriptwriters know exactly where to place these cliff-hangers, and they execute them very well,\u201d said Apple Yang, a minidrama director based in London.",
      "That helps explain the appeal of minidramas even if their overall quality is sometimes \u201cunderwhelming,\u201d said Ying Zhu, a professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "\u201cMake the dialogue real and less mechanic. Make it funny when possible and biting when needed,\u201d Zhu said. \u201cOne minute can pack in a lot of info if done well.\u201d"

      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",
      "On Monday, Kim called for a rapid nuclear buildup amid annual U.S.-South Korea joint military exercises that Pyongyang sees as a rehearsal for invasion.",

      "The migrants are among hundreds of thousands of Afghans who have returned in recent months from Iran and Pakistan, both of which announced a crackdown in October 2023 on people they said were living there illegally.",
      "There are fears that Afghanistan could be further destabilized by the mass expulsions, which have been criticized by international rights groups, as well as Afghanistan\u2019s ruling Taliban, as a violation of international norms and humanitarian principles. Many of those returning have lived outside Afghanistan for decades and are able to bring only what they can carry.",
      "\u201cThese Afghan refugees were returning home after spending a long time in Iran, but they could not reach their destination as their bus met with a tragic accident,\u201d Muttaqi said.",
      "Traffic accidents are common in Afghanistan, where decades of war have left roads in disrepair and traffic laws are poorly enforced.",
      "Since the 1970s, millions of people have fled Afghanistan for Iran and Pakistan, especially during the Soviet invasion in 1979 and the Taliban\u2019s return to power in 2021. Afghan migrants in both countries say they have faced systemic discrimination and even violence.",
      "U.N. human rights officials said last week that over 2.2 million people had returned to Afghanistan from Iran and Pakistan since the start of the year \u2014 more than 1.8 million from Iran and almost 400,000 from Pakistan. Authorities in both countries deny they are targeting Afghans specifically.",
      "Experts say many of the Afghan migrants were either forcibly deported or compelled to return in the face of threats, harassment and intimidation.",
      "Iran had told undocumented Afghans to leave the country by July 6, but departures accelerated amid a 12-day conflict in June between Iran and Israel, during which some Iranians accused Afghan migrants of espionage. The deadline has since been extended to Sept. 6.",
      "The U.N. says that the surge in the number of people returning to Afghanistan has created a \u201cmulti-layered human rights crisis\u201d and that some have been tortured and threatened by the Taliban because of their identities or personal histories. It says women and girls face an even higher risk of persecution in Afghanistan, where they are denied access to education past the sixth grade.",
      "Taliban officials say that people returning to Afghanistan are not being mistreated and that they receive cash, food, health care and other support upon their arrival.",
      "Afghanistan is already struggling to provide basic services to its population of more than 40 million, more than half of which relies on humanitarian assistance even as U.S. and other international funding is cut.",
      "Thousands of Afghans in the United States also face deportation after a federal appeals court last month allowed the Trump administration to remove protections enabling them to live and work in the country temporarily.",
      "Trump administration officials said Afghans in the United States no longer needed protected status because the situation in their home country is getting better.",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0Seven European leaders joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Washington on Monday in a rare display of trans-Atlantic unity. The gathering marked the first time in decades that such a broad delegation of allies had assembled at the White House under such pressing circumstances.",
      "Shortly after noon, one by one, the heads of state and NATO partners passed the White House gates, where they were met by President Donald Trump\u2019s chief of protocol, and in Zelenskyy\u2019s case, by Trump himself.",
      "Some met with Trump\u2019s special envoy for Ukraine and other officials that morning. Others made their way to the White House directly from Dulles and other airports. They were there to bolster Zelenskyy after a disastrous White House visit in February, when he clashed with Trump and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 and after Trump held a nearly three-hour one-on-one with Russian President Vladimir Putin last week.",
      "The show of support for Zelenskyy involved French President Emmanuel Macron, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Finnish President Alexander Stubb, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who pivoted from their own national agendas to present a united front as Trump seeks an urgent end to Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "The display took place within days of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska and ahead of a possible Trump-brokered meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy as Trump casts himself as a potential peace broker.",
      "Inside the Oval Office on Monday, evoking a boardroom scene, Trump sat behind the Resolute desk, military flags at his back, as Zelenskyy and the European delegation faced him, as reflected in a photo shared by the White House. Made of oak timbers taken from a British ship, the desk is a hulking 19th century reminder of goodwill between important allies, a gift from Britain's Queen Victoria to the United States. Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent are seen orbiting in the background, along with senior White House staff members.",
      "There are few precedents for the gathering, which merged diplomacy with Trump\u2019s usual verve.",
      "In 1941, Franklin Roosevelt hosted Winston Churchill off the coast of Newfoundland to sign the Atlantic Charter, laying out the Allied aims for the end of World War II and meetings that would decide the fate of Europe and Asia. During the Cold War, summits in Washington helped decide the terms of German reunification. They included meetings with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev amid a key question over whether Germany would join NATO. And in 1950, the British prime minister rushed to Washington to consult Harry Truman over fears of the possible use of nuclear weapons during the Korean War.",
      "\u201cWashington has often been the scene of these great moments of diplomacy. But it was the speed with which this came together that was so striking and sets this apart,\u201d said Marc Selverstone, director of presidential studies at the University of Virginia\u2019s Miller Center of Public Affairs. \u201cEveryone realized this was a crisis moment.\u201d",
      "The urgency was reflected in how quickly the past few days' events came together: Trump\u2019s talks with Putin on Friday were followed by the leaders\u2019 arrival in Washington on Monday morning. \u201cEvery single one of them got on a plane 48 hours later and flew to the United States of America,\u201d said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, rushing to Washington in a bid to keep momentum toward peace in Ukraine alive.",
      "The day also offered other made-for-TV moments, as Trump escorted the leaders to a gift shop of sorts, which he dubbed the \u201cMonica Lewinsky room\u201d in reference to a former president\u2019s trysts, where he showed off rows of fire engine red hats emblazoned with his campaign slogans, including one for 2028. At another point, Trump deflected a question to Zelenskyy about Ukraine\u2019s elections to joke about serving a third term himself.",
      "Told through photos shared online by his team, Trump presented a towering figure in Monday's meetings. In a picture posted by deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, Zelenskyy stood before a map of Ukraine as Trump looked down at him. Another image posted by the White House showed Trump seated behind his historic desk, this time with Vance and Rubio before him, the phone handset resting on the desk as he talked with Putin.",
      "For Zelenskyy, Monday also offered a reset. After a tense Oval Office meeting this year, he struck a more diplomatic tone Monday, offering Trump and others his thanks more than a dozen times, including for the invitation, for Trump\u2019s efforts \u201cto stop killings and stop this war,\u201d for Melania Trump\u2019s letter to Putin asking him to protect children, for a program to purchase American weapons and to the European partners for their support. On his X account, he offered profuse, continued thanks well into Tuesday.",
      "Wearing a suit instead of his usual military fatigues, he told Trump as he greeted him that the attire was \u201cthe best I had.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said, ultimately sharing a video of the warm exchange on his social media platform, Truth Social.",
      "Asked what his message to the people of Ukraine was, Trump told a reporter, \u201cWe love them.\u201d",
      "Vance, who had publicly clashed with Zelenskyy in their last White House meeting, also sought to smooth relations, posting a photo of their handshake.",
      "Finland\u2019s participation carried its own symbolic weight, with one reminder of a path out of a seemingly intractable conflict with a nuclear-powered Soviet Union, which Stubb referred to directly.",
      "\u201cWe, of course, have our own historical experience with Russia from World War II, the Winter War and the War of Continuation,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cAnd if I look at the silver lining of where we stand right now, we found a solution in 1944, and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to find a solution in 2025.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Finnish President Alexander Stubb has proved pivotal in the efforts to end the war between Russia and Ukraine, taking on new importance after he bonded with President Donald Trump over their mutual love of golf.",
      "Minutes after emerging from a four-hour meeting with Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and several other European leaders at the White House on Monday, Stubb described the results to NBC News.",
      "\u201cWhat we have agreed on is to work on European and American security guarantees, essentially, which will be secure from the European perspective, coordinated with the Americans,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s us who decide what kind of security guarantees we put up for Ukraine, not the Russians.\u201d",
      "He responded sharply to Russia\u2019s immediate rejection of the idea that those security guarantees would potentially include a NATO presence.",
      "\u201cRussia doesn\u2019t decide on that,\u201d Stubb said. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d",
      "Stubb, whose country joined NATO in 2023 in response to Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine the year before, said the leaders agreed Monday that security guarantees for Ukraine were among their top priorities, along with a bilateral meeting between Zelenskyy and Russian President Vladimir Putin, followed by a trilateral meeting including Zelenskyy, Putin and Trump.",
      "For Stubb, Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine is personal. Both his father and grandfather were born in cities that were ceded to Russia following Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s 1939 invasion of Finland and that remain part of Russia today. That history informs his commitment to Ukraine. Until Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, Finland, which shares more than 800 miles of border with Russia, had remained steadfastly neutral for decades, including during the Cold War.",
      "Stubb described his country as a regional \u201csecurity provider,\u201d pointing to its mandatory military service, large reserve forces and arsenal of weapons. \u201cWe have over 60 F-18s. We just bought 64 F-35s. We have long-range missiles, air, land and sea, and we have the largest artillery in Europe, together with Poland,\u201d he said.",
      "Finland and other European countries represented at the White House on Monday \u2014 Britain, France, Germany and Italy, as well as the heads of the European Commission and NATO \u2014 are part of a group known as the Coalition of the Willing, which also met virtually on Tuesday. Stubb said they have been working on how to help secure Ukraine for some time, and decided at the White House meeting to order their militaries and civil servants to come up with a plan as soon as next week.",
      "A location for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy has not yet been determined, but Stubb suggested Switzerland as a possibility. \u201cGeneva could work actually,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that would be neutral territory for it.\u201d",
      "Stubb said the goal is for the meeting to happen as soon as possible, hopefully \u201cwithin the next two weeks.\u201d",
      "Switzerland\u2019s foreign minister, Ignazio Cassis, said Tuesday morning that the country would grant Putin immunity to enter the country for such a meeting, despite an arrest warrant for him for war crimes by the International Criminal Court of Justice. Putin would be at risk of arrest in most other countries in Europe, among a total of 125 nations that observe the ICC\u2019s jurisdiction. The U.S. does not.",
      "18 holes and diplomacy",
      "Stubb gained Trump\u2019s ear over a round of golf in West Palm Beach, Florida, in March, when they competed together in a member-guest tournament at one of Trump\u2019s courses and Trump gifted Stubb a new set of clubs to replace the set Stubb had brought with him.",
      "According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked Stubb over lunch if he could trust Putin, and Stubb told him \u201cyou cannot.\u201d Hours later, the Journal noted, Trump publicly criticized Putin for the first time over his refusal to agree to a cease-fire with Ukraine.",
      "The Journal also reported on informal calls and texts between the two leaders since then, including Trump sometimes consulting Stubb before speaking with Putin. Zelenskyy has also publicly thanked Stubb for helping him build a connection with Trump in the aftermath of Trump and Zelenskyy\u2019s infamously heated Oval Office meeting in February.",
      "Stubb also seems to have sensed how to communicate to Trump the extent of Putin\u2019s prospective land grab of Ukraine\u2019s territory.",
      "\u201cFor an American audience,\u201d he told NBC News, \u201cthe best way to explain it is that if you take the relative land mass of what Russia wants right now from Ukraine, it would be a little bit like you giving up Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, even Virginia, and then bumping into Maryland.\u201d"

      "After his February fiasco in the Oval Office, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's \"fabulous\" fashion decision \u2014 as well as the golf club, personal letter and supportive European leaders he brought with him \u2014 appear to have helped shift the mood of his high-level White House talks on peace with Russia.",
      "While the Kremlin publicly smarted, a sense of relief swept through Ukraine and across Europe after the summit Monday with President Donald Trump.",
      "Zelenskyy hailed it Tuesday as \u201ca truly significant step\u201d toward ending the war.",
      "His team came away from the talks relieved that worst case scenarios were avoided and pleased that Trump now appears to recognize the crucial importance of security guarantees for Kyiv to secure any peace agreement \u2014 and the need for the U.S. to play a role in those arrangements, a source familiar with the Ukrainian government\u2019s thinking told NBC News.",
      "Russia may never agree to such a concept and Trump may yet change his mind, but for the moment, they were satisfied with the day\u2019s conversations, the source said.",
      "Trump told \"Fox & Friends\" that the U.S. could provide air support as part of such an arrangement, but ruled out American troops on the ground.",
      "Changing outfits \u2014 and mood",

      "A fixation on attire might seem trivial given the stakes as the world leaders gathered to discuss ending the brutal conflict, but style mattered here.",
      "For Europe\u2019s leaders, the meeting was about optics as much as substance: A chance to undo any ground Russian President Vladimir Putin may have gained with Trump in Alaska last week.",
      "\u201cI love it,\u201d Trump said as he greeted Zelenskyy, no doubt sparking a sigh of relief from the suited gaggle of European heads of state who had flown in determined to avoid a repeat of February's bust-up, when Zelenskyy was lambasted for not wearing a suit and accused of disrespecting the White House.",
      "Zelenskyy had clearly adjusted his approach to diplomacy beyond his outfit, opening with a flurry of 11 \u201cthank yous\u201d in four and a half minutes, a striking contrast with February when he was branded ungrateful.",
      "The Ukrainian leader forged family ties, handing his host a letter from Ukrainian first lady Olena Zelenska to be delivered to American first lady Melania Trump. Zelenskyy also presented Trump with a golf club, a gift passed on to him by a wounded Ukrainian soldier.",
      "\"You look fabulous in that suit,\" said the reporter who took Zelenskyy to task about his outfit in February.",
      "Zelenskyy himself didn\u2019t leave empty handed. Trump handed him \u201csymbolic keys to the White House,\u201d the Ukrainian president\u2019s office said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "He was not alone in working to woo the American leader even as the discussion turned to the knotty details of ceasefires and security guarantees.",
      "It was no accident the European contingent included figures with reputations for charming Trump, a delegation curated to curry favor who took every opportunity to shower Trump with praise for his efforts to break the deadlock with Moscow.",
      "\u201cSomething has changed, thanks to you,\u201d said Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni.",
      "\u201cI really want to thank you for your leadership,\u201d opined NATO chief Mark Rutte.",
      "The substance of the talks remains murky, but Trump refrained from blaming Europe and appeared to enjoy the onslaught of flattery while even offering some in return.",
      "He complimented German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on his tan and showed off a shelf of MAGA hats to Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron.",
      "And the spectacle did not go unnoticed in Moscow.",
      "The newspaper Moskovskij Komsomolets said European leaders had begun negotiations with \u201coutright bootlicking,\u201d while outlet Argumenty said Zelenskyy had \u201chumiliated\u201d himself in the White House.",
      "Former Russian President Dmitry Medvedev scoffed that Europe had \u201cthanked and sucked up\u201d to Trump, while sneering at Zelenskyy's sartorial choice. \"The question is which tune the Kiev clown will play about guarantees & territories back home, once he\u2019s put on his green military uniform again,\" he said.",
      "In his own apparent attempt at flattery, Medvedev opined that Europe\u2019s leaders had \u201cfailed to outplay\u201d Trump.",
      "In Ukraine, however, the mood was positive.",
      "\u201cThis round of talks was won by Ukraine and its allies outright,\u201d Serhii Kosiianchuk, a 39-year-old account manager from Kyiv, told NBC News. He said he was \u201cimpressed\u201d by the meeting, adding that \u201cprevious mistakes\u201d had been taken into account.",
      "But the theater may have overshadowed the thinness of concrete results.",
      "Welcoming the contrast to the \"fiasco\" of February, graphic designer Kateryna Gonchar, 38, was nonetheless cautious about the path forward.

      "Many analysts agreed.",
      "Europe's leaders had \"bent over backwards to butter up Trump,\" but the war \"doesn't look any closer to resolution,\" said Michael Bociurkiw, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank.",

      "Trump said he intended the next step to be a direct meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin, while European leaders reconvened later Tuesday.",

      "Trump took note of Zelenskyy's more decorous look. Ditching his traditional wartime garb, he wore a dark, formal jacket with a collar.",
      "\"The best I had,\" Zelenskyy told him.",
      "\"I love it!\" Trump said.",
      "Fresh off his summit with Putin, Trump sat down with Zelenskyy to see whether they can resolve sticking points centered on Ukraine's future security and the status of territory the Russian military has seized in eastern and southern Ukraine.",
      "Zelenskyy said later that their private meeting in the Oval Office went well. \u201cWe had a very good conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the best one.\u201d",
      "Asked whether U.S. troops would help secure a peace deal, Trump did not rule out the possibility.",
      "As a condition of ending the war, Putin has insisted that his country retain about 20% of Ukrainian territory that it now controls. Zelenskyy has said Ukraine's constitution forbids him to cede any land.",
      "Trump and Zelenskyy spoke to the news media in the Oval Office before they went behind closed doors. Trump suggested he will not abandon efforts to forge a peace deal, though he conceded the Russia-Ukraine conflict has proved particularly stubborn.",
      "\"It's never the end of the road,\" Trump said. \"People are being killed, and we want to stop that. So I would say it's not the end of the road. I think we have a good chance of doing it.\"",
      "When a reporter asked whether he was prepared redraw Ukraine's map if it would end the war sooner, Zelenskyy did not answer directly.",
      "\"We need to stop this war,\" he said. \"To stop Russia, we need support from American and from European partners.\"",
      "Upon finishing the meeting, Trump and Zelenskyy went straight to another meeting with the European leaders: French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.",
      "\"We will come to a resolution today I think on almost everything, including probably the security,\" Trump said before the start of that meeting.",
      "After they finished the talks, Trump and the European leaders moved into the Oval Office for further discussions, according to a White House official.",
      "Europe looms large in any accord between the combatants. Looking to prevent future Russian attacks, European nations would be an important part of any security guarantees that Ukraine has requested as part of any peace deal.",
      "But the United States also may play a part, Trump said \u2014 a surprising admission from the \"America First\" president. If there is a Trump foreign policy doctrine, it is that he wants to extricate the United States from foreign wars and shift some of the peacekeeping burden from the United States to other countries.",
      "Yet when he was asked whether he would deploy Americans to Ukraine to help preserve a peace deal, Trump did not dismiss the idea out of hand.",
      "\"We're going to work with Ukraine, we're going to work with everybody, and we're going to make sure that if there is peace, the peace is going to stay long-term,\" he said.",
      "With the TV cameras present, the tone was far more cordial than in Zelenskyy's last visit. In that February meeting, Vice President JD Vance sat beside Trump and berated Zelenskyy for not showing enough gratitude to Trump. This time, Vance sat in the same place but stayed silent.",
      "In the last visit, Trump memorably told Zelenskyy that he didn't hold any \"cards\" and that his country was \"in big trouble.\"",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re gambling with World War III, and what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that\u2019s backed you,\u201d he told Zelenskyy at the time.",
      "The meeting was ultimately cut short.",
      "Who holds the better \"cards\" at this point? a reporter asked Trump on Monday.",
      "\"I don't want to say that,\" he replied.",
      "Trump has lately stepped up his role in ending the conflict. With an eye on the Nobel Peace Prize, he met privately with Putin at a military base in Anchorage, Alaska, on Friday to jump-start peace talks. He and Putin strode down a red carpet together before a private meeting that lasted nearly three hours.",
      "Though he said beforehand that  he wanted a ceasefire, Trump left the summit without one and said he was shifting his aim, instead, toward a full-fledged \"peace agreement.\"",
      "The Trump administration's messaging has at times been muddled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Sunday on NBC News' \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that a ceasefire was \u201cnot off the table.\"",
      "Rubio said in the interview that \u201cno one is pushing Ukraine to give that up,\u201d referring to land occupied by Russia. Later in the day, Trump appeared to undercut Rubio when he reposted a Truth Social user who declared, \u201cUkraine must be willing to lose some territory to Russia otherwise the longer the war goes on they will keep losing even more land!!\u201d",
      "Sunday night on Truth Social, Trump seemed to place the onus of ending the war on Zelenskyy, as opposed to Putin, who sent tanks rolling into Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Trump wrote that Ukraine must give up Russian-annexed Crimea and also abandon any hope of joining NATO \u2014 one of Putin's demands.",
      "\"President Zelenskyy of Ukraine can end the war with Russia almost immediately, if he wants to, or he can continue to fight,\" Trump wrote.",
      "Zelenskyy took a different stance. He wrote late Sunday on X that \u201cRussia must end this war, which it itself started.\u201d",
      "The meetings Monday give the leaders a forum to discuss future security guarantees for Ukraine, which U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff floated as potentially looking similar to NATO\u2019s Article 5.",
      "Ukraine hopes to negotiate an ironclad security guarantee, similar to Article 5's all-for-one provision, and convince Trump that a temporary ceasefire is necessary to begin real peace talks, according to a Ukrainian source familiar with the goals. The security guarantees should be a treaty-level obligation, the source said, which require Senate approval.",
      "A challenge for Zelenskyy is to persuade Trump that Russia should give up the territory it seized by force. A European official said it was their belief that Ukraine would never give up all of its eastern Donbas region, much of which Russia controls.",
      "In the run-up to the Alaska summit, Trump said an end to the war would include \u201csome swapping of territories.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy promptly shot down the prospect, saying, \u201cUkrainians will not give their land to the occupier.\u201d"

    "summary": "Hundreds of thousands of people shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at nationwide protests across Israel about the Gaza war.",
    "story": [
      "TEL AVIV \u2014 In the plaza that Israelis have christened \u201cHostage Square,\u201d hundreds of thousands of people banged drums, shouted slogans and booed mentions of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others in his right-wing government.",
      "Some held pictures of those still in captivity in Gaza, others vented their frustration over plans for a new military offensive in some of the enclave\u2019s most populated areas that many Israelis fear could further endanger the lives of the remaining hostages, 20 to 50 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "Among the demonstrators at Sunday\u2019s protest was Ruby Chen, the father of Itay Chen, an Israeli American soldier who was among the 1,200 killed in the Hamas-led terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, and whose body remains in Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe Jewish Bible speaks about the Jewish life,\u201d Chen told NBC News. \u201cLife comes before revenge, and that is exactly what we are asking for this government to remember.\u201d",
      "The protest in Tel Aviv on Sunday was one of dozens organized nationwide, including outside of politicians\u2019 homes, at military headquarters and on major highways. Demonstrators blocked lanes and lit bonfires. Some restaurants and theaters closed in solidarity. Police said they arrested 38 people.",
      "The nationwide marches were on the same day as a general strike called by organizations representing relatives of those still in captivity. One of those groups, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, said in a statement that nearly 1 million people had attended rallies nationwide.",
      "In Hostage Square, the boisterous atmosphere softened as former hostages and family members of those still being held took to the largest of three soundstages to demand the release of the remaining hostages. Around 250 people were taken hostage on Oct. 7.",
      "Many of the speeches, signs and prepared videos appealed directly to President Donald Trump in English, pleading with him to compel Netanyahu to \u201cseal the deal\u201d with Hamas.",
      "While Sunday\u2019s protests were among some of the largest and fiercest in 22 months of war, smaller demonstrations held on a weekly basis have yet to sway the government to end the conflict, which Netanyahu has said he is determined to continue until Hamas is completely destroyed.",
      "The prime minister and his top officials poured scorn on Sunday\u2019s demonstrations.",
      "\u201cThose who today call for an end to the war without defeating Hamas are not only hardening Hamas\u2019s position and delaying the release of our hostages, they are also ensuring that the horrors of Oct. 7 will be repeated,\u201d the prime minister told his Cabinet on Sunday.",
      "His ultranationalist Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, one of the Cabinet's most hawkish right-wing voices, in a post on X called the protests a \u201ctoxic and harmful campaign that plays into the hands of Hamas, buries the hostages in tunnels, and tries to bring the State of Israel to surrender to its enemies and endanger its security and future.\u201d",
      "Their government\u2019s approach appears to have the backing of Trump. \u201cWe will only see the return of the remaining hostages when Hamas is confronted and destroyed,\u201d he wrote Monday on Truth Social. \u201cPlay to WIN, or don\u2019t play at all!\u201d",
      "While Israeli media reported that Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir met with senior officials on Sunday to finalize the plans for the expanded operations in Gaza, it remains unclear when the country\u2019s military will begin the new offensive in the north of the enclave and in what Netanyahu has called the \u201ccentral camps\u201d of Gaza.",
      "The U.N. humanitarian office said last week that 1.35 million people were already in need of emergency shelter items in Gaza, so any armored incursion could displace hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been uprooted multiple times during a war that has killed more than 62,000 people, according to health officials in the Hamas-run enclave.",
      "Two children were among five people who died of malnutrition-related causes, the Gaza Health Ministry said Monday, bringing the total number of malnutrition-related deaths to 263.",
      "The United Nations also warned that levels of starvation and malnutrition in Gaza are at their highest since the war began. Much of the aid destined for Gaza has been prevented from entering since Israel imposed a total blockade in March after ending a ceasefire. Deliveries have since partially resumed, though aid organizations say the flow is far below what is needed.",
      "In Hostage Square, some held up pictures of emaciated Palestinians, but many simply wanted an end to the fighting and a deal to free those hostages who remain in Gaza.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m sure that most of the Israelis are here with us now,\u201d said Keren Leibovitz, 54, whose son Tomer was killed on Oct. 7, 2023, while he was serving in the Israeli military.",
      "Leibovitz added that before Israel worked on completely defeating Hamas, the majority of her countrymen \u201cwant the war to end and they want the hostages to come back.\u201d"
