      "Actor Jerry Adler has died at 96",
      "NEW YORK -- Jerry Adler, who spent decades behind-the-scenes of storied Broadway productions before pivoting to acting in his 60s, has died at 96.",
      "Adler died Saturday, according to a brief family announcement confirmed by the Riverside Memorial Chapel in New York.",
      "Among Adler's acting credits are \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d on which he played Tony Soprano adviser Hesh Rabkin across all six seasons, and \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d where he played law partner Howard Lyman. But before Adler had ever stepped in front of a film or television camera, he had 53 Broadway productions to his name \u2014 all behind the scenes, serving as a stage manager, producer or director.",
      "He hailed from an entertainment family with deep roots in Jewish and Yiddish theater, as he told the Jewish Ledger in 2014. His father, Philip Adler, was a general manager for the famed Group Theatre and Broadway productions, and his cousin Stella Adler was a legendary acting teacher.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a creature of nepotism,\u201d Adler told TheaterMania in 2015. \u201cI got my first job when I was at Syracuse University and my father, the general manager of Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, called me (because) there was an opening for an assistant stage manager. I skipped school.\u201d",
      "After a long theater career, which included the original production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d and working with the likes of Marlene Dietrich, Julie Andrews and Richard Burton, among many others, Adler left Broadway during its 1980s slump. He moved to California, where he worked on television productions like the soap opera \u201cSanta Barbara.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really getting into the twilight of a mediocre career,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1992.",
      "But the retirement he was contemplating was staved off when Donna Isaacson, the casting director for \u201cThe Public Eye\u201d and a longtime friend of one of Adler's daughters, had a hunch about how to cast a hard-to-fill role, as The New York Times reported then. Adler had been on the other side of auditions, and, curious to experience how actors felt, agreed to try out. Director Howard Franklin, who auditioned dozens of actors for the role of a newspaper columnist in the Joe Pesci-starring film, had \u201cchills\u201d when Adler read for the part, the newspaper reported.",
      "So began an acting career that had him working consistently in front of the camera for more than 30 years. An early role on the David Chase-written \u201cNorthern Exposure\u201d paved the way for his time on a future Chase project, \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhen David was going to do the pilot for \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 he called and asked me if I would do a cameo of Hesh. It was just supposed to be a one-shot,\u201d he told Forward in 2015. \u201cBut when they picked up the show they liked the character, and I would come on every fourth week.\u201d",
      "Films included Woody Allen's \u201cManhattan Murder Mystery,\u201d but Adler was perhaps best known for his television work. Those credits included stints on \u201cRescue Me,\u201d \u201cMad About You,\u201d \u201cTransparent\u201d and guest spots on shows ranging from \u201cThe West Wing\u201d to \u201cBroad City.\u201d",
      "He even returned to Broadway, this time onstage, in Elaine May's \u201cTaller Than a Dwarf\u201d in 2000. In 2015, he appeared in Larry David's writing and acting stage debut, \u201cFish in the Dark.\u201d",
      "\u201cI do it because I really enjoy it. I think retirement is a road to nowhere,\u201d Adler told Forward, on the subject of the play. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t know what to do if I were retired. I guess if nobody calls anymore, that\u2019s when I\u2019ll be retired. Meanwhile this is great.\u201d",
      "Adler published a memoir, \u201cToo Funny for Words: Backstage Tales from Broadway, Television and the Movies,\u201d last year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to go at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d he told CT Insider then, when asked if he'd take more acting roles. In recent years, he and his wife, Joan Laxman, relocated from Connecticut back to his hometown of New York.",
      "For Adler, who once thought he was \u201ctoo goofy-looking\u201d to act, seeing himself on screen was odd, at least initially. And in multiple interviews with various outlets, he expressed how strange it was to be recognized by the public after spending so many years working behind the scenes. There was at least one advantage to being preserved on film, though, as he told The New York Times back in 1992.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m immortal,\u201d he said.",

      "His official social media accounts said Wednesday that he \"passed away peacefully\" after \u201ca long and courageous battle with pancreatic cancer.\u201d",
      "Caprio billed his courtroom as a place \u201cwhere people and cases are met with kindness and compassion.\" He was known for dismissing tickets or showing kindness even when he handed out justice.",

      "Caprio's show was filmed in his courtroom and featured his folksy humor and compassion. Clips from the show have had more than 1 billion views on social media.",

      "\u201cThe phrase, 'With liberty and justice for all' represents the idea that justice should be accessible to everyone. However it is not,\u201d Caprio said in one video. \u201cAlmost 90% of low-income Americans are forced to battle civil issues like health care, unjust evictions, veterans benefits and, yes, even traffic violations, alone.\u201d",
      "Caprio's upbeat take on the job of a judge drew him millions of views. His most popular videos have been those where he calls children to the bench to help pass judgment on their parents.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- After three decades in Hollywood, Daniel Dae Kim has done spy thrillers, sci-fi epics and medical dramas. But there\u2019s one role that\u2019s eluded the Korean American actor: romantic leading man. \u201cI\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years,\u201d Kim says with a laugh.",
      "His latest project, \u201cButterfly,\u201d which features a star-studded cast including top Korean actors Kim Tae-hee and Park Hae-soo (\u201cSquid Game\u201d), follows a former U.S. intelligence operative in South Korea whose past catches up with him. It premiered on Amazon Prime in the U.S. and elsewhere earlier this month, but makes its Korean debut Friday.",
      "In a recent interview with The Associated Press in Seoul, South Korea, Kim revealed one of his biggest regrets, reflected on cultural lessons from the Korea-U.S. co-production, and opened up about what it\u2019s really like being the bridge between two cultures while pursuing his mission to tell stories \u201cthat haven\u2019t been told yet.\u201d The interview has been edited for clarity and brevity.",
      "KIM: As an EP, I\u2019m a job creator. I am a person responsible for a lot of people, and I will fight so much harder for others than I often fight for myself. When I feel like one of the cast, or one of the crew, or one of the writers is not being taken care of, I\u2019m not afraid to talk to anybody and have a hard conversation.",
      "KIM: Every day, there was something that needed to be translated literally through language but also working styles. In Korea, because it\u2019s a more Confucian society, the hierarchy of departments is very clear. We had to learn to talk to the head of the department who would then talk to the staff, as opposed to if you have an issue with one of the staff, you go directly to the staff. This kind of thing was new to the Americans.",
      "KIM: I think in 2007 I got a DUI when I was working on \u201cLost,\u201d and I regret that night every day of my life. At the time, I felt so much shame, so much guilt, so much regret. I felt terrible to my parents, because that\u2019s not the way I think they wanted me to be raised. I think with the right perspective, these things, these mistakes that you made can actually be helpful for your life because they can guide you in certain ways.",
      "KIM: We\u2019re already seeing it. If you look at what happened with Paramount and CBS News, we\u2019re seeing a chilling effect on free speech and journalism and DEI. \u201cDEI\u201d is a bad word these days, but to me, DEI\u2019s not a fad. The idea of inclusion is not something that\u2019s a political trend. It\u2019s my life. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived every decade I\u2019ve been in this business.",

But now Korea is so used to that kind of thing that people are much more understanding.",
      "KIM: I have a lot of sympathy for actors who take stereotypical roles when they\u2019re starting out because you need some way to break into the business. It\u2019s much easier once you\u2019re more successful and more established because you have more financial stability. It\u2019s something that, if you\u2019re not a person of color, or someone who\u2019s a minority in the United States, you don\u2019t have to think about. You don\u2019t think about what this role means for the rest of a nation or an ethnicity. You just do what you\u2019re drawn to, and that\u2019s very liberating. I am lucky enough now where I can also make those same choices. But I don\u2019t ever escape the fact that whatever I do will be watched and seen by so many people and judged through their own lens and filters.",
      "KIM: I\u2019m still waiting to play a romantic lead after all these years. I\u2019ve never gotten the opportunity and it\u2019s one of those interesting things because I look the way I do as an Asian American and Asian men were never considered handsome or sexy.

And I said to Jimmy like, \u201cWho would have thought you, Jimmy, would have been the one to be the romantic lead?\u201d But I was so happy for him because it meant that the way we were looking at Asian men was different.",

      "Prosecutors said in papers filed shortly before midnight Wednesday that Combs masterminded elaborate sexual events for two ex-girlfriends between 2008 and last year that involved hiring male sex workers who sometimes were required to cross multiple state lines to participate.",
      "A jury in July exonerated the Bad Boy Records founder of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that carried the potential penalty of a mandatory 15 years in prison up to life behind bars. But it convicted him of two lesser Mann Act charges that prohibit interstate commerce related to prostitution.",

      "\u201cEvidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on the Mann Act counts was overwhelming,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "They noted that the multiday, drug-fueled sexual marathons that Combs demanded of his girlfriends involved hiring male sex workers and facilitating their travel across multiple states for what became known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors said he then used video recordings he made of the sexual events to threaten and coerce the girlfriends to continue participating in the sometimes weekly or monthly sexual meetings.",
      "\u201cAt trial, there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s convictions,\u201d prosecutors said.",
      "They said Combs \u201cmasterminded every aspect\u201d of the sexual meetups, paying escorts to travel across the country to participate and directing the sexual activity that took place between the men and his girlfriends \u201cfor his own sexual gratification\u201d while sometimes joining in.",

      "A woman who testified under the pseudonym \u201cJane\u201d said she participated in \u201chotel nights\u201d when she dated Combs from 2021 to last September and that the events sometimes lasted multiple days and required her to have sex with male sex workers, even when she was not well.",
      "Both women testified that Combs had threatened to release videos he made of the encounters as a way of controlling their behavior.",
      "\u201cDuring these relationships, he asserted substantial control over Ventura and Jane\u2019s lives. Specifically, he controlled and threatened Ventura\u2019s career, controlled her appearance, and paid for most of her living expenses, taking away physical items when she did not do what he wanted,\u201d prosecutors wrote.",
      "\u201cThe defendant similarly paid Jane\u2019s $10,000 rent and threatened her that he would stop paying her rent if she did not comply with his demands,\u201d they said.",
      "In their submission requesting acquittal or a new trial, Combs' lawyers argued that none of the elements normally used for Mann Act convictions, including profiting from sex work or coercion, existed.",
      "\u201cIt is undisputed that he had no commercial motive and that all involved were adults,\u201d the lawyers said. \u201cThe men chose to travel and engage in the activity voluntarily. The verdict confirms the women were not vulnerable or exploited or trafficked or sexually assaulted.\u201d",
      "The lawyers said that Combs, \u201cat most, paid to engage in voyeurism as part of a \u2018swingers\u2019 lifestyle\u201d and argued that \u201cdoes not constitute \u2018prostitution\u2019 under a properly limited definition of the statutory term.\u201d",

      "Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98",
      "WASHINGTON -- Jules Witcover, who cowrote one of the nation\u2019s leading political columns for nearly three decades, died Saturday at the age of 98, his daughter Amy Witcover-Sandford said.",
      "Witcover's widely syndicated daily column, written jointly for 24 years with the late Jack Germond, gave him an outlet to register strong opinions, leaving little doubt which politicians he admired or despised. \u201cPolitics Today\u201d began at The Washington Star and then moved to The Baltimore Sun, and he continued writing it solo for another five years at The Sun after his partner retired in 2001.",
      "Witcover also covered the political beat for the Newhouse News Service, The Los Angeles Times and The Washington Post, in books and in several magazines, including The New Republic, Saturday Review and The Nation.",
      "Through his long career, Witcover had a remarkable front seat to history, some of it tragic. He watched Robert F. Kennedy steady first lady Jackie at President John F. Kennedy's grave in 1963. Five years later, in 1968, he pushed his way through a crowded hotel kitchen in Los Angeles after hearing shots and saw Robert F. Kennedy bleeding on the floor. He would later write of RFK's brief presidential campaign in the book \u201c85 Days.\u201d",
      "Witcover described himself and the curmudgeonly Germond as \u201cfriendly rivals laboring for obscure newspaper chains\u201d who enjoyed long, booze-soaked dinners on the campaign trail, a culture that was chronicled in Timothy Crouse\u2019s classic account of reporters covering the 1972 presidential election, \u201cBoys on the Bus.\u201d",
      "When Witcover and Germond began co-writing their column in 1977, \u201cwe often played the good cop/bad cop routine, each of us able to blame the other guy when a column one of us wrote caused a politician to complain. But sometimes, too, one of us would take the bullet for the other when it unjustly came our way. That was the nature of playing duet pianos in the house of ill repute called political writing,\u201d Witcover wrote in The Sun after Germond\u2019s death in 2013.",
      "At its peak, the syndicated column ran five times a week and appeared in about 140 newspapers.",
      "In his final years as a columnist, Witcover relentlessly hammered President George W. Bush over the Iraq war, calling it \u201cthe most wrong-headed foreign policy in my lifetime and the most dangerous.\u201d But he did not blame that view for The Sun\u2019s dropping his column. Editorially, the newspaper also opposed the war, although less vigorously.",
      "\u201cThe war was a colossal mistake from the start and has disintegrated into a calamity, damaging not only the people of Iraq but the international reputation of this country, not to mention the terrible cost in American lives and treasure,\u201d he wrote for the Poynter Institute\u2019s blog.",

      "Witcover was born in Union City, New Jersey, to a Jewish father and Catholic mother. He was raised Catholic and showed an early interest in writing. He wrote in his memoirs that he and a cousin produced a one-page family newspaper on Thanksgiving that they sold for a nickel.",
      "A classmate on his high school basketball team persuaded him to apply to Columbia, which he attended for a semester before joining the Navy. He then re-enrolled in the college after the war ended and obtained a master's degree at Columbia's graduate school of journalism.",
      "Years later, he told a reporter that he thought his ship had come in when a newspaper in the Boston area offered him a starting job covering the Boston Braves in spring training. Before he could get started the team decided to move its franchise to Milwaukee and the opportunity died.",
      "By 1962, 11 years after graduation, he had become a senior correspondent and the chief political writer for the Newhouse News Service.",
      "Witcover lived in Washington with his second wife, Marion Elizabeth Rodgers, a biographer of the journalist H.L. Mencken. His first marriage, of nearly four decades, to Marian Laverty, ended in divorce.",
      "\"Jules was the hardest working newsman I ever knew,\" said Walter Mears, who as the chief political writer for The Associated Press traveled extensively with Witcover. \"On the road, you could hear him banging the typewriter before dawn, working on one of his books. He never stopped writing columns and political histories long after most of us had retired.\"",

      "The Menendez brothers are set to make their cases for parole this week",
      "LOS ANGELES -- After serving nearly 30 years in prison for killing their parents, the Menendez brothers will plead their case in front of a panel of California state parole board commissioners starting Thursday.",
      "Erik and Lyle Menendez were sentenced in 1996 to life in prison for fatally shooting their father, Jose Menendez, and mother, Kitty Menendez, in their Beverly Hills mansion in August 1989. They were 18 and 21 at the time.",
      "For years after their convictions, the brothers filed petitions for appeals of their cases that were denied. But the brothers became eligible for parole after a Los Angeles judge in May reduced their sentences from life in prison without the possibility of parole to 50 years to life, marking the closest they\u2019ve been to freedom since their convictions.",
      "Even if the board grants their parole, it could still be months before the brothers walk free \u2014 if at all. If the board grants each brother\u2019s parole, the chief legal counsel has 120 days to review the case. Then, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has 30 days to affirm or deny the parole.",
      "Here\u2019s a look at their case over the last three decades:",
      "___",
      "March 1990: Lyle Menendez, then 21, is arrested. A few days later, Erik Menendez, 18, turns himself in. They are charged with first-degree murder.",
      "July 1993: The Menendez brothers go on trial, each with a separate jury. Prosecutors argued that they killed their parents for financial gain. The brothers\u2019 attorneys don\u2019t dispute the pair killed their parents, but argued that they acted out of self-defense after years of emotional and sexual abuse by their father.",
      "January 1994: Both juries deadlock.",
      "October 1995: The brothers\u2019 retrial begins, this time with a single jury. Much of the defense evidence about alleged sexual abuse is excluded during the second trial.",
      "March 1996: Jurors convict both brothers of first-degree murder.",
      "July 1996: The brothers are sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.",
      "February 1998: A California appeals court upholds the brothers\u2019 conviction, and three months later, the state Supreme Court agrees.",
      "October 1998: The brothers file habeas corpus petitions with the California Supreme Court. After they are denied the next year, they file petitions in federal district court, which are also denied.",
      "September 2005: The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals denies their habeas corpus appeal.",
      "May 3: Attorneys for the Menendez brothers ask the court to reconsider the convictions and life sentences in light of new evidence from a former member of the boy band Menudo, who said he was raped by Jose Menendez when he was 14. In addition, they submit a letter that Erik wrote to his cousin before the killings about his father\u2019s abuse.",

The following week, Newsom orders the state parole board to conduct a \u201ccomprehensive risk assessment\u201d to determine whether the brothers have been rehabilitated and if they would pose a danger to the public if released.",

      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d explores the Ohio-born art-rock band known for their quirky style and misunderstood message",
      "NEW YORK -- You know the band Devo, right? The guys with the funny red plastic hats and jumpsuits? The New Wave musicians behind the silly \u201cWhip It\u201d video? They had that odd, spiky '80s vibe? Well, it turns out you may not know as much as you think.",
      "The new Netflix documentary \u201cDevo\u201d is an eye-opening examination of an Ohio-born art-rock band that argues they were perhaps the most misunderstood band on the face of the planet. It debuts on the streaming service Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWe were trivialized and pigeonholed,\u201d co-founder Gerald Casale tells The Associated Press. \u201cThis documentary allows us to talk about what we were thinking and what we are motivated by to create what we created.\u201d",
      "Directed by Chris Smith, \u201cDevo\u201d uses archival footage and interviews to trace the band's beginnings, rise and fall, with cameos from fans like David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Neil Young.",
      "Devo introduced themselves to the world in 1977 by making a frenetic version of the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cI Can\u2019t Get No) Satisfaction,\u201d which earned them a crucial slot on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d On stages, they would wriggle like worms or dress like the guys from \u201cGhostbusters.\u201d",
      "They released their Brian Eno-produced debut, \u201cQ: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!,\u201d in 1978 and reached platinum status with 1980\u2019s \u201cFreedom of Choice,\u201d which featured \u201cWhip It,\u201d a hit just as their label was getting ready to drop them.",
      "But behind the odd neck braces and knee pads were powerful art and literary ideas about where the country was going. They named themselves after the idea that modern society was entering a process of \u201cdevolution.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were seeing a world that was the antitheses of the idealized, promised future ginned up in the \u201950s and \u201960s.\u201d Casale says in the movie. \u201cWhat we saw was regression.\u201d",
      "The nucleus of the band was formed from tragedy: Casale and Mark Mothersbaugh met at Kent State University, where they lived through the 1970 killing of four unarmed anti-war student protesters by the National Guard.",
      "That tragedy forged in the pair an antiestablishment, anti-capitalist protest, mixing lofty art history with pop culture. They admired Dadaism and Andy Warhol. The factories of Akron inspired their gray overalls and clear plastic face masks \u2014 portraying cogs in a machine like in the art movie \u201cMetropolis.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe had a meta-approach,\u201d Casale tells the AP. \u201cIt was a multimedia, big idea approach. Music was an element, a layer, a dimension, but it was connected to this big worldview.\u201d",
      "Part of Devo's strength was its visual component and their videos were drenched with political commentary. The upbeat \u201cBeautiful World\u201d featured footage of police violence, the KKK and bombings, while \u201cFreedom of Choice\u201d warned against the dangers of conformity.",

      "Members of Devo \u2014 which also included Mark's brother, Bob, Gerald's brother, Bob, and Alan Myers \u2014 performed on TV and chatted with talk show hosts like David Letterman but their satire never seemed never to break through.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to hear us talking about the duality of human nature and the dangers of groupthink and the atrophication of people being able to think logically and think critically,\u201d Casale says. \u201cIt was like, \u2018That\u2019s a bummer. Just tell us about drugs and sex.\u2019\u201d",
      "Rock has always needed bands like Devo, a corrective to the corporate machine. You can see an echo of Devo when M.I.A. raised her middle finger during the Super Bowl halftime show in 2012. The members of Devo cite such bands as Rage Against the Machine and System of a Down as keeping the flame alive.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can hope is that it will create an awareness and get rid of complacency, but it doesn\u2019t seem to have done that in the past,\u201d Mothersbaugh tells the AP.",

      "After Devo, Casale directed music videos and commercials, while Mothersbaugh scored movies and TV shows such as \u201cPee-Wee\u2019s Playhouse,\u201d \u201cThe Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou,\u201d \u201cRugrats\u201d and \u201cHello Tomorrow!\u201d",
      "There are signs of optimism when members of Devo play live these days. Mothersbaugh says he sees a lot of young people, who have used their smartphones to bypass media gatekeepers.",
      "\u201cWe see a lot of people that look like us, with gray hair out there in the audience. But there\u2019s also, there\u2019s also a lot kids, which is kind of surprising to me, but I think it\u2019s only because they have this thing in their hand that they sometimes use to their advantage.\u201d",
      "Devo are set to hit the road later this year in a co-headlining tour with the B-52's. The Cosmic De-Evolution Tour will kick off Sept. 24 in Toronto and wraps Nov. 2 in Houston.",
      "You may think of Devo as New Wave or early electronica or synth-pop. but they see themselves differently: \u201cWe were true punk, meaning we questioned illegitimate authority and we stayed in our own lane and did our thing, remaining true to our vision,\u201d says Casale. \u201cThat\u2019s punk.\u201d",

      "Fandom is a funny thing in the age of social media. Spend enough time scrolling and it\u2019s easy to feel like you really know a celebrity, and all their friends. The new film \u201cLurker,\u201d a Sundance breakout in theaters Friday, explores the question of what might happen if a certain type of fan got a foot in the door, and what they might do to stay there.",
      "Archie Madekwe\u2019s Oliver hardly knows what\u2019s coming when he walks into a trendy Los Angeles clothing shop. A rising music star, Oliver seems already accustomed to a certain amount of attention wherever he goes, with asks for selfies and autographs just part of the deal. So of course he\u2019s taken aback when one of the employees, Th\u00e9odore Pellerin\u2019s Matthew, doesn\u2019t seem to know or care who he is. Oliver doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s an act and is soon asking this stranger to come around and hang with his entourage.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning Matthew thinks Oliver has this god-given place of celebrity and success,\u201d Pellerin said. \u201cHe quickly understands that he will have to give things to serve a certain purpose in Oliver\u2019s world and his ego. But also that they\u2019re not dissimilar. They\u2019re both playing by a certain rule book that is written by Oliver. If the power becomes Matthew\u2019s, he can also write the rules.\u201d",
      "The film is the directorial debut of Alex Russell, whose own star is rising. He wrote \u201cForks,\u201d widely considered one of the best episodes of \u201cThe Bear,\u201d and won an Emmy for co-executive producing the Netflix series \u201cBeef.\u201d His script for \u201cLurker,\u201d which he wrote sort of as a challenge for himself during COVID lockdowns, immediately became a hot commodity. Madekwe remembers being bummed when he didn\u2019t hear back after he put himself on tape to play the hanger-on.",
      "A few years later, Madekwe\u2019s agent called and said Russell wanted to meet him. Not for Matthew, but for Oliver.",
      "\u201cI had to completely rethink the film and the structure and the what it was about,\u201d Madekwe said. \u201cBut it was most daunting to imagine myself needing to go and meet Alex and convince him that I could play somebody like this cool character.\u201d",
      "He needn\u2019t have been so worried. Unbeknownst to Madekwe, Russell had been doing some stealth behind-the-scenes work. After someone recommended his name, Russell saw Madekwe in a coffee shop one day and just watched him for 20 minutes. His conclusion: This is Oliver.",
      "Russell was cognizant of the limitations he was faced with as a first-time director making an independent film, where things like casting and hiring are often rushed.",
      "\u201cMy goal was to get what I felt like were underrated actors,\u201d Russell said. \u201cPeople who could come in and really hit it out of the park. Then people would look at this movie and be like wow they really took a step up here. That\u2019s kind of where you can punch above your weight if you\u2019re making your first movie and don\u2019t have a huge budget.\u201d",
      "It wasn\u2019t just his leads either, but the full ensemble including Sunny Suljic, Havana Rose Liu, Zack Fox and Daniel Zolghadri \u2014 faces you might recognize, but names you might not yet know. Putting it together was hard work, with strict limits on budget and time, but Russell said the experience of \u201cLurker\u201d was charmed nonetheless.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s only because I got so lucky with decisions I made early on with casting and hiring,\u201d he said. \u201cSo much of it is like I\u2019m just a kid with a screenplay and everyone else has to be really good at their job.\u201d",

That was helpful for me \u2014 it was like the fun aspect of the movie, not the hard-core humiliation.\u201d",
      "Many involved describe the process as uniquely collaborative. Madekwe also stepped up as a producer, which wasn\u2019t just a vanity title. He was actually involved in many major creative decisions, including recommending Suljic, who he\u2019d just worked with on a music video, and finding locations and some of the music for the film, including a song called \u201cLove and Obsession,\u201d written by Rex Orange County.",

Based on a true story, \u201cEden\u201d retraces what happened when a group of Europeans attempted to start anew on the remote island of Floreana, only to encounter the earthly failings they hoped to escape: chaos, blackmail, betrayal and even murder.",

      "\u201cEden\u201d shows us none of that, instead dropping us on a small island of the Gal\u00e1pagos, where Dr. Friedrich Ritter ( Jude Law ) and his loyal partner, Dore Strauch Ritter ( Vanessa Kirby ) found solace after fleeing their native country. The idealist doctor is inspired by a newfound purpose of penning radical philosophy that will \u201csave humanity from itself.\u201d",
      "Yet the historical resonance, which could have provided pointed commentary on the parallels between today and the 1920s, falls flat amid the film\u2019s overlong runtime, unlikable characters and shaky accents that most actors stumble in and out of. In the midst of the film\u2019s crafted chaos, the story inevitably loses focus. Still, \u201cEden\u201d made room for some memorable performances.",

The tension between the two groups further exacerbates when Eloise Bosquet de Wagner Wehrhorn ( Ana de Armas ), who calls herself the Baroness, arrives with her two lovers, determined to build a resort on the island.",

      "His death on Sunday was disclosed in a death notice published online, prompting a wave of tributes from and an array of fans and those close to him within the industry, including the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, or BAFTA.",

As the Kryptonian arch enemy to Christopher Reeve's Man of Steel, Stamp introduced a darker, charming and vulnerable \u2014 more human \u2014 element to the franchise, one that's been replicated in countless superhero movies ever since.",

      "\u201cThe closer the camera moved, the more hypnotic his presence became. In close-up, his unblinking gaze locked in so powerfully that the effect was extraordinary. Terence was a true movie star: the camera loved him, and he loved it right back,\u201d Wright said.",

      "He got his break with \u201cBilly Budd\u201d and Stamp embarked on a career that would see him in the early 1960s be part of the \u201cangry young men\u201d movement that was introducing an element of social realism into British moviemaking.",

      "The network, which appeals to liberal audiences with a stable of personalities including Rachel Maddow, Ari Melber and Nicole Wallace, has been building its own separate news division from NBC News. It will also remove NBC\u2019s peacock symbol from its logo as part of the change, which will take effect later this year.",
      "The name change was ordered by NBC Universal, which last November spun off cable networks USA, CNBC, MSNBC, E! Entertainment, Oxygen and the Golf Channel into its own company, called Versant. None of the other networks are changing their name.",
      "MSNBC got its name upon its formation in 1996, as a partnership then between Microsoft and NBC.",
      "Name changes always carry an inherent risk, and MSNBC President Rebecca Kutler said that for employees, it is hard to imagine the network under a different name. \u201cThis was not a decision that was made quickly or without significant debate,\u201d she said in a memo to staff.",
      "\u201cDuring this time of transition, NBC Universal decided that our brand requires a new, separate identity,\u201d she said. \u201cThis decision now allows us to set our own course and assert our indepedence as we continue to build our own modern newsgathering organization.\u201d",

      "Like in their 2020 comedy \u201cThe Climb,\u201d Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin's \u201cSplitsville\u201d is full of first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts",
      "You can say this: Michael Angelo Covino and Kyle Marvin know how to start a movie.",
      "Their 2020 breakout film, \u201cThe Climb,\u201d begins with two best friends on a bike ride just before Kyle (Marvin) is to be wed. Mid-climb, Mike (Covino) confesses he slept with the bride-to-be. In one long take, an argument on two wheels ensues, with huffing and puffing in between.",
      "Their new follow-up to that film, \u201cSplitsville,\u201d likewise kicks off with heartbreak on the open road. This time, Carey (Marvin), a gym teacher, is driving along a highway with his life coach wife, Ashley (Adria Arjona). They seem happy enough, though there are hints of trouble. When Ashley says she wants to have new experiences, Carey suggests pottery. Ashley corrects him: \u201cI meant sexual.\u201d",
      "When an erratic driver careens off the road, they run to check on the passengers. Finding the woman thrown clear of the car, Ashley \u2014 faced with her own mortality \u2014 decides then and there to get a divorce.",
      "In both \u201cThe Climb\u201d and \u201cSplitsville,\u201d these are just the first sharp turns in relationship roller coasters that unfold in clattering one-take set pieces mixed with nakedly frank heart-to-hearts. Their movies \u2014 Covino directs; they write together \u2014 are a little like Wile E. Coyote versions of a rom-com. And part of their considerable appeal is in how much Marvin and Covino are willing to put themselves through the ringer.",
      "Like \u201cThe Climb,\u201d \u201cSplitsville\u201d is a relationship farce that keeps amplifying and recycling. From the scene of the accident, as the credits unspool, Carey trudges seemingly aimless across the countryside. (Splitsville is Nowheresville.) Eventually, though, he arrives at the handsome lakeside home of his childhood best friend, Paul (Covino), who lives there with his wife Julie (Dakota Johnson) and young son Russ (Simon Webster).",
      "Paul and Carey have a close enough relationship that Paul comes right into the shower to check for ticks on Carey. Later that night, he and Julie casually acknowledge that they have an open marriage. Julie, for instance, could sleep with anyone. Even Carey, they note.",

      "Batiste pairs lyrics about devotion, values, angels and ecology with music that mixes folk and funk, gospel and the blues. The range is such that Batiste even plays a little fiddle and mandolin, but he shines brightest on two songs featuring his solo piano.",
      "The first is a wonderful duet with Randy Newman, another piano man with New Orleans roots, who in recent years has been slowed by health issues and kept a low profile. They cover Doc Pomus\u2019 \u201cLonely Avenue,\u201d and Newman\u2019s legendarily froggy tenor provides a comical contrast to Batiste\u2019s vocal sheen. \u201cI could die, I could die, I could die,\u201d Newman sings. \u201cIt sounds like I\u2019m dying.\u201d",

      "LAS VEGAS -- Tourism in Las Vegas is slumping this summer, with resorts and convention centers reporting fewer visitors compared to last year, especially from abroad, and some officials are blaming the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs and immigration policies for the decline.",
      "The city known for lavish shows, endless buffets and around-the-clock gambling welcomed just under 3.1 million tourists in June, an 11% drop compared to the same time in 2024. There were 13% fewer international travelers, and hotel occupancy fell by about 15%, according to data from the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.",
      "Mayor Shelley Berkley said tourism from Canada \u2014 Nevada's largest international market \u2014 has dried up from a torrent \u201cto a drip.\u201d Same with Mexico.",
      "\u201cWe have a number of very high rollers that come in from Mexico that aren\u2019t so keen on coming in right now. And that seems to be the prevailing attitude internationally,\u201d Berkley told reporters earlier this month.",
      "Ted Pappageorge, head of the powerful Culinary Workers Union, called it the \u201cTrump slump.\u201d He said visits from Southern California, home to a large Latino population, were also drying up because people are afraid of the administration's immigration crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf you if you tell the rest of the world they\u2019re not welcome, then they won\u2019t come,\u201d Pappageorge said.",
      "Canadian airline data shows fewer passengers from north of the border are arriving at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas. Air Canada saw its passenger numbers fall by 33% in June compared to the same time a year ago, while WestJet had a 31% drop. The low-cost carrier Flair reported a whopping 62% decline.",
      "Travel agents in Canada said there's been a significant downturn in clients wanting to visit the U.S. overall, and Las Vegas in particular. Wendy Hart, who books trips from Windsor, Ontario, said the reason was \u201cpolitics, for sure.\u201d She speculated it was a point of \u201cnational pride\u201d that people were staying away from the U.S. after President Donald Trump said he wanted to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "\u201cThe tariffs are a big thing too. They seem to be contributing to the rising cost of everything,\u201d Hart said.",
      "At downtown's Circa Resort and Casino, international visits have dipped, especially from Canada and Japan, according to owner and CEO Derek Stevens. But the downturn comes after a post-COVID spike, Stevens said. And while hotel room bookings are slack, gaming numbers, especially for sports betting, are still strong, he said.",
      "\u201cIt's not as if the sky is falling,\u201d he said. Wealthier visitors are still coming, he said, and Circa has introduced cheaper package deals to lure those with less money to spend.",

      "Hernandez Govan, 45, was indicted on first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder charges about a year after Young Dolph was killed. Prosecutors have accused him of organizing the fatal shooting.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name was Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Govan is charged with conspiring with Justin Johnson and Cornelius Smith Jr. to kill Young Dolph.",
      "Johnson was convicted of first-degree murder in September 2024 and the same day, sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole. He was later sentenced for his two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "During the trial, Smith testified that rapper Yo Gotti\u2019s brother, Anthony \u201cBig Jook\u201d Mims, had put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph\u2019s record label, Paper Route Empire. Smith said he and Johnson were \u201clooking for somebody\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t know who we were going to catch.\u201d",
      "They knew that Young Dolph and some of the artists on his label were participating in the turkey giveaway, so they were heading in that direction when they saw Young Dolph\u2019s car. They followed him to the cookie shop and opened fire in broad daylight, Smith said. Young Dolph was hit 22 times and died at the scene.",
      "At the earlier trials, prosecutor Paul Hagerman told trial jurors that Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down. Young Dolph later wrote diss tracks directed at the label, its artists and its \u201cNo. 2 person,\u201d Big Jook. Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Smith testified he received $800 before he was arrested and his defense attorney later received another $50,000.",
      "In addition to Smith\u2019s testimony, prosecutors presented a large amount of circumstantial evidence, including from surveillance cameras and Johnson\u2019s cellphone. The evidence includes calls between Smith and Johnson shortly before the killing and a call between Johnson and Big Jook immediately after.",
      "Smith is also charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder and has pleaded not guilty. A trial date has not been set for him.",

There are numerous varieties of mint, oregano and cilantro, hyssop and New Zealand spinach, four-leaf sorrel, yarrow and a local variety of tarragon.",
      "R\u00f6tzel has built Monk Garden as a business since 2022, delivering to high-end restaurants that want flavorsome local plants for their dishes. It also organizes \u201cwild herb walks\u201d and workshops showing people how to make skin cream, wine and other items from the plants.",
      "Packed into about 2,000 square meters (21,530 square feet) in Marienfelde, on Berlin\u2019s southern edge, each of the plants has its own flavors and tangs and, in many cases, medicinal properties.",

      "The Alaska State Medical Board will be considering language that says medical professionals provide gender-affirming care for children could risk having their work considered unprofessional conduct",
      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Alaska medical professionals who provide gender-affirming care for children could risk disciplinary action under a proposal set for review by the state medical board on Friday.",
      "The proposal would deem any professional who uses hormonal and surgical treatments for minors \u201cas being grossly negligent\u201d and subject to sanctions by the board, according to the board\u2019s minutes from a June meeting.",
      "The type and extent of disciplinary actions were not spelled out, and board member Matt Heilala, an Anchorage podiatrist who was helping write the proposed regulations, declined to discuss the details Thursday with The Associated Press ahead of the meeting.",
      "The move comes after the board in March sent a letter to state lawmakers expressing opposition to hormonal or surgical gender-affirming care for minors and urging legislators to enact limits on treatments. The Legislature \u2014 controlled by bipartisan majorities in both the House and Senate \u2014 didn\u2019t take up the issue before adjourning in May.",
      "Critics worry the board is overstepping its authority in pursuing regulations that could leave medical providers open to possible disciplinary actions. Instead of allowing the legislative process to play out, \u201cthey are now becoming the legislators themselves, which is inappropriate,\u201d said state Sen. L\u00f6ki Tobin, a Democrat who has been outspoken in support of the LGBTQ+ community.",
      "The medical board at a June meeting designated member Heilala to help draft a statement for consideration that would pertain to declaring those providing the care \u201cas being grossly negligent and therefore subject to disciplinary sanctions,\u201d according to the minutes of that meeting.",
      "Heilala declined to discuss the specific language stemming from that directive that the board would consider Friday but told the AP that the proposed rules would go through a deliberate and transparent process for the public. Such processes can take months, he said.",
      "Gender-affirming care includes a range of medical and mental health services to support a person\u2019s gender identity, including when it\u2019s different from the sex they were assigned at birth. It encompasses counseling, medications that block puberty and hormone therapy to produce physical changes as well as surgeries to transform chests and genitals, though those are rare for minors.",
      "Most major medical groups say access to the treatment is important for those with gender dysphoria and see gender as existing along a spectrum. While there\u2019s wide, if not universal, medical consensus, the political situation is contentious.",
      "In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott had issued an order allowing the state to investigate parents of transgender youth for child abuse. But a Texas judge in 2022 blocked the state from investigating families of transgender youths who have received such care and members of the LGBTQ advocacy group PFLAG Inc. over such medical care.",
      "Tom Pittman, executive director of Identity Inc., an Anchorage-based advocacy and health care organization for the LGBTQ+ community, said about 500 Alaska medical professionals have signed an open letter opposing the changes being considered by the board.",

      "Fewer than 100 youth are receiving such gender-affirming care, Pittman said.",
      "Pittman called Heilala\u2019s actions politically motivated, saying he \u201chas co-opted Alaska\u2019s medical board and institution to launch a bid for governorship, and he\u2019s using scapegoating and discrimination against what is a very small vulnerable population of Alaskans to create a bully pulpit for himself.\u201d",

      "The shift to direct federal oversight underscores the severity of the problems at the Boar's Head plant, said Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who now heads STOP Foodborne Illness, a consumer advocacy group. It raises concerns about communication between state and federal officials when problems occur, she added.",
      "\u201cGiven its history, it's particularly important that there be robust oversight of that plant,\u201d Eskin said.",

      "The Ugandan farmer said recently that she regretted the loss of what would have been her second child \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t discover malaria and treat it early.\u201d",
      "Variations of such cases are commonly reported by Ugandan health workers who witness stillbirths or feverish babies that die within days from undiagnosed malaria. The deaths are part of a wider death toll tied to the mosquito-borne disease, the deadliest across Africa, but one easily treated in adults who seek timely medical care.",
      "Until recently, a major gap in malaria treatment was how to care for newborns and infants infected with malaria who weren\u2019t strong enough to receive regular medication. That changed last month when Swiss medical regulators approved medicine from the Basel-based pharmaceutical company Novartis for babies weighing between 2 and 5 kilograms (nearly 4\u00bd to 11 pounds).",
      "Swissmedic said the treatment, a sweet-tasting tablet that disperses into a syrup when dropped into water, was approved in coordination with the World Health Organization under a fast-track authorization process to help developing countries access much-needed treatment.",

      "Nigeria, Congo and Uganda \u2014 in that order \u2014 are the African countries most burdened by malaria, a parasitic disease transmitted to humans through the bites of infected mosquitoes that thrive and breed in stagnant water.",
      "The drug approved by Swiss authorities, known as Coartem Baby in some countries and Riamet Baby in others, is a combination of two antimalarials. It is a lower dose version of a tablet previously approved for other age groups, including for older children. Before Coartem Baby, antimalarial drugs designed for older children were administered to small infants with careful adjustments to avoid overdose or toxicity.",

      "China has been installing solar panels far faster than anywhere else in the world, and the investment is starting to pay off. A study released Thursday found that the country's carbon emissions edged down 1% in the first six months of 2025 compared to a year earlier, extending a trend that began in March 2024.",
      "The good news is China's carbon emissions may have peaked well ahead of a government target of doing so before 2030. But China, the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases, will need to bring them down much more sharply to play its part in slowing global climate change.",
      "For China to reach its declared goal of carbon neutrality by 2060, emissions would need to fall 3% on average over the next 35 years, said Lauri Myllyvirta, the Finland-based author of the study and lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.",

      "China installed 212 gigawatts of solar capacity in the first six months of the year, more than America's entire capacity of 178 gigawatts as of the end of 2024, the study said. Electricity from solar has overtaken hydropower in China and is poised to surpass wind this year to become the country's largest source of clean energy. Some 51 gigawatts of wind power was added from January to June.",

      "Human rights groups say the 43-year-old has gone on at least six hunger strikes protesting abuses in Penal Colony No. 24 in Zarechcha. The U.N. experts said in May her condition \u201chas been life-threatening for some time now.\u201d",
      "Sharenda-Panasiuk, who was in the same penal colony, said she saw a guard in 2023 punch Kulsha in the back, causing her to fall. The same guard later choked her by grabbing her from behind, she added.",

      "The 60-year-old Italian teacher at Minsk State Linguistic University described particularly harsh treatment at Penal Colony No. 4, including the installation of a \u201cshame cage\u201d in the courtyard.

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un supervised the test-firing of two types of new antiair missiles, state media said Sunday, displaying his expanding military capabilities as the South Korean and U.S. militaries carry out joint drills.",
      "The North\u2019s official Korean Central News Agency said the test Saturday proved the missiles effective in countering aerial threats such as drones and cruise missiles, and that Kim assigned unspecified \u201cimportant\u201d tasks to defense scientists ahead of a major political conference expected early next year.",
      "The report did not specify the missiles that were tested or where the event took place. It did not mention any remarks by Kim directed at Washington or Seoul.",
      "The test coincided with new South Korean President Lee Jae Myung \u2019s trip to Tokyo for a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, where they vowed to strengthen bilateral cooperation and their trilateral partnership with the United States to address common challenges, including North Korea\u2019s nuclear ambitions. Lee was to depart for Washington on Sunday for a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump.",

      "Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court has ordered a review of the detention of three right-wing leaders held without trial",
      "LA PAZ, Bolivia -- Bolivia\u2019s Supreme Court on Friday ordered judges to urgently review whether three prominent right-wing leaders had been held in prison for too long without trials, threatening to reopen a tumultuous chapter in Bolivia's politics just days after a presidential election ended two decades of dominance by the governing leftist party.",
      "Bolivia's Chief Justice Romer Saucedo gave judges 24 hours to scrutinize the length of pretrial detention in high-profile cases stemming from the crisis over the 2019 ouster of former President Evo Morales, Bolivia's first Indigenous president, according to a copy of the document obtained by The Associated Press.",
      "The order, experts say, could pave the way for the release from custody of three of Bolivia's most divisive right-wing politicians: Former interim leader Jeanine A\u00f1ez, former governor Luis Fernando Camacho and his former running mate, Marco Antonio Pumari.",
      "After his contested reelection to an unprecedented fourth term in 2019 set off mass protests, Morales stepped down under pressure from the military, paving the way for A\u00f1ez, a previously little-known senator and staunch Catholic, to assume office as interim leader.",
      "As president, A\u00f1ez oversaw a brutal crackdown by security forces on civilian protesters and stifled dissent, with at least 37 people being killed in the postelection violence.",
      "A year after new elections in 2020 vaulted to power current President Luis Arce, Morales' handpicked successor from his long-ruling Movement Toward Socialism, or MAS, party, A\u00f1ez was arrested on charges of terrorism and sedition, among other offenses tied to Morales' 2019 ouster which his supporters view as a coup.",
      "In 2022, A\u00f1ez was sentenced to 10 years in prison on charges of breaching her duties and violating Bolivia\u2019s constitution but faces at least seven other open criminal cases covering a range of charges, including her involvement in the killings of protesters.",
      "A\u00f1ez appealed the sentence and contested the other charges, arguing that she should only be judged in a special impeachment process for former presidents that requires authorization from two-thirds of Congress before any trial can proceed. She is currently being tried as an ordinary citizen.",
      "Camacho, a close ally of A\u00f1ez, has been in pretrial detention since his arrest in late 2022 while leading a strike against Arce's government in the country\u2019s business hub of Santa Cruz. He was detained on suspicion of terrorism and insurrection over his role in 2019 leading mass protests against Morales\u2019 re-election.",
      "Pumari, who ran as Camacho\u2019s running mate in the 2020 elections against Arce, was also arrested on charges related to his involvement in Morales\u2019 removal from power and has been held in pretrial detention since 2021.",
      "In Bolivia, critics say the courts have become a political prize to control rather than an impartial arbiter.",
      "When A\u00f1ez came to power, she charged Morales, then in self-exile, with sedition and terrorism even as evidence was lacking.",
      "When Arce came to power, he oversaw the arrests of A\u00f1ez, Camacho and Pumari, raising concerns among international watchdogs that he, too, was using the courts to target his adversaries.",
      "Now, some see the judiciary\u2019s abrupt move to reexamine the cases as similarly motivated by politics.",

      "Ukraine is marking 34 years of independence, and the country\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists are reflecting on how early decisions shaped its struggle today",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Oleksandr Donii was one of the leaders of student-led protests for sovereignty and political reform in 1990 that preceded Ukraine\u2019s declaration of independence. He remembers thinking the fight for autonomy would take decades.",
      "Instead, it came much sooner than he ever imagined. When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine quickly declared independence in 1991 and later conducted a referendum backed by more than 90% of voters.",
      "\u201dI was preparing myself for prisons and labor camps, and I thought the struggle would last about 20\u201330 years,\u201d Donii told The Associated Press.",
      "As the country marks 34 years since that monumental event Sunday, Donii and others from Ukraine\u2019s first generation of lawmakers and activists describe how despite separation from the Soviet Union, Moscow's grip endured. Russia used political pressure, social division and the sidelining of pro-Western voices. That eventually paved the way for the full-scale invasion of Ukraine three decades later and Ukraine\u2019s current fight for independence and identity in the face of its aggressive neighbor.",
      "Back in 1990, Donii and other student leaders of a hunger strike were calling not only for breaking away from Moscow but also for renewing the political system at home.",
      "Their first proposal was to conduct snap elections for Ukraine\u2019s Parliament, which Donii saw as essential for clearing out the Soviet-era lawmakers still in office. The idea, however, failed to gain broad support even among pro-independence forces.",
      "\u201cUkraine, having won independence, did not win the removal of the Communist ruling class,\u201d he said.",
      "In his view, opportunities that were within reach in the early 1990s slipped away, leaving Ukraine to pay a high price today as it presses toward the European Union and NATO not as distant aspirations but as urgent necessities for safeguarding sovereignty and securing an independent path.",
      "Oleksandr Nechyporenko, a lawmaker from the first Ukrainian Parliament, remembers how fragmented society was on the verge of independence.",
      "\u201cA very large part was neutral, it included people who wavered, who didn\u2019t have enough information,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThere was also a big and powerful core that was categorically in favor of preserving the Soviet Union, communist rule, ties with Russia, and so on.\u201d Nechyporenko says the \u201cpassionate change-makers\u201d were a minority.",
      "In his view, Ukraine\u2019s tolerance toward agents of Russian influence since the early days of its independence was a major mistake. \u201cWe should have been more firm, more radical,\u201d he said.",

One of the most consequential was the choice to surrender the vast nuclear arsenal left on Ukrainian soil after the Soviet collapse.",
      "\u201cThe path we were supposed to take with the world\u2019s third-largest nuclear arsenal \u2014 about five thousand nuclear warheads \u2014 that path should have given us the opportunity to effectively use this potential for integration with the West,\u201d said Yurii Kostenko, a scholar and politician who led negotiations on Ukraine\u2019s nuclear disarmament in the early 1990s.",
      "He says that while leading the negotiation process, his vision of nuclear disarmament included the U.S. assisting Ukraine financially and technologically to turn nuclear warheads into fuel for nuclear power plants. Accession to NATO would have been Ukraine\u2019s guarantee of security. The American side was ready to make it happen, Kostenko says.",
      "But instead of cooperation with the U.S., Kostenko recalls Ukraine being eventually pressured into surrendering its warheads to Russia, receiving almost nothing in return. He said to achieve that, then-Russian President Boris Yeltsin demanded Kostenko\u2019s dismissal as leader of the negotiations by Ukraine\u2019s then-President Leonid Kravchuk. That demand was granted.",
      "No longer led by Kostenko, Ukraine\u2019s delegation dropped the initial plan codesigned with the U.S. and chose to cooperate with Russia instead. Kostenko says that in exchange for its nukes, Ukraine received $1.5 billion in nuclear fuel and natural gas from Russia, which, he says, was worth around 1% of what Ukraine gave up.",
      "Instead of NATO accession, Ukraine received the Budapest Memorandum, an agreement in which Ukraine was granted assurances of sovereignty and territorial integrity from the United States, the United Kingdom and Russia. For many Ukrainians, it has become a symbol of promises that carried no weight. Moscow shredded the agreement first with the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and then with the full-scale invasion in 2022. Three decades later, as Ukraine once again negotiates its future with Western partners under the shadow of Russian aggression, the choices and compromises of the 1990s still loom large, shaping its search for lasting security.",

      "Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles is visiting while Australian forces engage in their largest combat exercises with the Philippine military, involving more than 3,600 military personnel in live-fire drills and battle maneuvers. Marles has been invited to witness a mock amphibious beach assault by Australian and Filipino naval forces over the weekend in a western Philippine town facing the South China Sea, Philippine military officials said.",
      "After their meeting, Marles and Philippine Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. will sign a joint statement of intent to further boost defense cooperation and affirm \u201ctheir resolve to enhance interoperability, collective deterrence and long-term military readiness ... to promote regional security and stability,\" according to Philippine defense officials.",
      "The exercises called Alon, Tagalog for wave, will showcase Australia\u2019s growing firepower. The drills will involve an Australian guided-missile navy destroyer, F/A-18 supersonic fighter jets, a C-130 troop and cargo aircraft, Javelin anti-tank weapons and special forces sniper weapons.",
      "China has raised alarm over such combat exercises in or near the disputed waters, which it claims almost in its entirety, but where the United States and its treaty allies, Australia and the Philippines, have staged joint naval patrols and drills with other countries to boost deterrence against threats to freedom of navigation and overflight.",
      "China\u2019s military have separately confronted U.S., Australian and Philippine ships and aircraft in alarmingly close calls to assert what Beijing calls its sovereignty and sovereign rights in the strategic waterway, a key global trade route, sparking fear of a larger conflict that may involve American forces and their allies in what has long been regarded as an Asian flashpoint.",
      "The large combat drills between Australia and the Philippines, from Aug. 15-29, coincide with a new territorial faceoff between Chinese and Philippine forces in the Second Thomas Shoal. The Philippine navy deliberately grounded a warship in 1999 at the shoal to serve as its territorial outpost. China deployed ships keeping continuous watch at the shoal after Manila refused its demand to withdraw the BRP Sierra Madre.",
      "The Philippine military said Thursday night that China has deployed several coast guard and suspected militia ships, along with a swarm of speedboats, some fitted with high-caliber machine guns and backed by a helicopter and a drone, closer to the grounded warship. A Chinese boat came as close as 50 meters (164 feet) to the Sierra Madre, and two boatloads of Filipino forces were deployed from the ship to prevent the Chinese from coming closer.",
      "Chinese officials did not immediately comment on the Philippine military statement. A Philippine security official said the Chinese actions at Second Thomas shoal were being closely monitored by the U.S. military through aerial surveillance. The Philippine official did not elaborate and spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.",

      "Rauf initially said that Talabani failed to appear before a judge after being summoned, but later said the operation was carried out \u201csuddenly without informing him about the arrest order.\u201d He confirmed that three members of the local security forces were killed in the raid.

      "Iran's foreign minister is planning a call with French, German, and British counterparts to avoid U.N. sanctions over its nuclear program",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Just days away from a European deadline, Iran said Friday its foreign minister would hold a telephone conference call with his French, German and British counterparts to avoid the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over Tehran's nuclear program.",
      "The call, planned for Friday by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi according to Iran's state-run IRNA news agency, comes as the three parties to Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal threaten to reimpose those sanctions under a mechanism known as \u201csnapback\u201d in the accord. The European Union's chief diplomat will also join the call, IRNA said.",
      "The Europeans' concern over the Iranian program, which had been enriching uranium to near weapons-grade levels before the 12-day Iran-Israel war in June saw its atomic sites bombed, has only grown since Tehran cut off all cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency in the conflict's wake. That has left the international community further blinded to Iran's program \u2014 as well as the status of its stockpile of uranium enriched to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%.",
      "Iran has long insisted its program is peaceful, though it is the only non-nuclear-armed nation enriching uranium at that level. The U.S., the IAEA and others assess Iran had a nuclear weapons program up until 2003.",
      "In a letter Aug. 8, the three European nations warned Iran it would proceed with \u201csnapback\u201d if Tehran didn't reach a \u201csatisfactory solution\u201d to the nuclear issues. That deadline would be Aug. 31, in nine days, leaving little time for Iran to likely reach any agreement with the Europeans, who have grown increasingly skeptical of Iran over years of inconclusive negotiations over its nuclear program.",
      "Restoring the IAEA's access is a key part of the talks. Iran has blamed the war with Israel in part on the IAEA, the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, without offering any evidence. The IAEA issues quarterly reports on Iran's program and the 2015 deal gave it greater access to keep track of it.",

      "The Central Park Conservancy argued in an Aug. 12 letter to the City Council that horse carriages have an outsized impact on public safety and road infrastructure in the increasingly crowded park.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t be just frozen in time,\u201d said Elizabeth Smith, the conservancy's CEO, in an interview this week. \u201cHorses are too unpredictable and the roadways are too busy with too many different kinds of users now \u2014 bikers, runners, pedestrians, strollers.\u201d",
      "Smith noted other cities have done away with the nostalgic rides, including San Antonio, which passed a five-year phase out of the industry last year. Chicago banned it starting in 2021 and Montreal did the same the year prior.",
      "The carriage industry argues it\u2019s being unfairly singled out, despite the number of horses in the park barely budging since World War II.",
      "There are currently 68 licensed carriage owners with a total of about 200 horses and 170 drivers, according to the Transport Workers Union, which represents industry employees.",
      "Meanwhile, Central Park sees some 40 million visitors annually, many of them increasingly zipping around on rental bikes or hitching a ride on one of the human-powered pedicabs that line the park\u2019s entry points. Cars were banned from the park's drives in 2018.",
      "Eliminating carriage horses also goes against famed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision for the park, with its hilly paths and undulating roads tailor-made for leisurely carriage rides, argues Christina Hansen, a longtime carriage driver and industry spokesperson.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing the park the way it was meant to be seen,\u201d she said as she gave a recent tour, which runs about $72 for the first 20 minutes and $29 for each additional 10 minutes.",
      "Animal rights groups have long complained the horses can get easily spooked on city streets, leading to accidents and injuries. They also claim the horses are overworked and live in inadequate stables and their drivers flaunt city regulations, including leaving behind piles of horse manure. All animals are supposed to be fitted with manure-catching devices.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no way to operate horse-drawn carriages and have it be safe or humane for the horses,\u201d said Edita Birnkrant, executive director of the animal rights group New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets. \u201cNo amount of regulation can change that. Lord knows we have tried.\u201d",
      "The conservancy\u2019s call came after a carriage horse collapsed and died near its stables earlier this month, with videos and photos of the animal\u2019s body in a city street circulating widely online.",
      "But the organization, which was formed to revitalize the park in the 1980s, didn\u2019t weigh in on the animal welfare concerns in its letter to the council.",
      "Smith said the tipping point was two recent incidents of carriage horses running amok: in May, a spooked horse bolted from its handler and ran loose through the park. Days later, two more horses broke free from their drivers and crashed into a fleet of parked pedicabs, breaking a driver\u2019s wrist and causing other injuries.",
      "City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams\u2019 office declined to say this week whether the proposed ban would even be heard, let alone put to a vote this session.",

      "They work a maximum of nine hours a day and must stop giving rides if it\u2019s above 89 degrees (32 degrees Celsius) or above 80 F (27 C) with high humidity.",
      "They also don\u2019t work if the temperature plummets below 19 F (minus 7 C) or if there\u2019s severe weather, and must get at least five weeks vacation a year outside city limits with daily access to pasture.",

      "On a visit to one of the Manhattan stables this week, ornately decorated carriages were parked on the ground level and horses were housed on the second and third floors in stalls measuring at least 8-by-10 foot (2.4-by-3 meter) and padded down with hay, although there was no outside pasture.",
      "Lynn Buckalew, a tourist from Utah lined up for a carriage ride earlier this week, said a guided jaunt through the park was high on her to-do list. But she was taken aback when she learned about the complaints of abuse and the Aug. 5 death of a 15-year-old mare from an aortic rupture less than two months into the job.",
      "\u201cYou know that\u2019s sad, if that\u2019s the case. It makes me look at it a little different,\u201d Buckalew said as her husband hopped on the carriage and the driver called her aboard.",

      "It did not specify what the national security concerns are.",
      "President Donald Trump has made sweeping strides to prioritize fossil fuels and hinder renewable energy projects.

      "Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House\u2019s demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laser focused ... on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said.",
      "She remains concerned that the Fed still needs to fight stubborn inflation, a view shared by several colleagues.",
      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed's independence.",
      "\u201cThe not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we\u2019re getting on with the business,\u201d Posen said. \"We\u2019re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d",
      "It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.",
      "Trump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",
      "Cook has said she would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into giving up her position. She declined Friday to comment on Trump's threat.",
      "If Cook is somehow removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Members of the board vote on all interest rate decisions. He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.",
      "Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months.",
      "Powell is no stranger to Trump's attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn't stop Powell.",
      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",
      "\u201cThat would do further damage to the Fed's credibility around maintaining low and stable price inflation,\u201d he said.",

      "The moment was especially gratifying for the woman in charge of manufacturing the drones that flew more than 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) to carry out this mission. For months after, Russia no longer had the means to keep up devastating glide bomb attacks like the one that had just targeted her native city of Kharkiv.",
      "\u201cFighting in the air is our only real asymmetric advantage on the battlefield at the moment. We don\u2019t have as much manpower or money as they have,\u201d said Iryna Terekh, head of production at Fire Point.",

      "The Associated Press was granted an exclusive look inside one of Fire Point\u2019s dozens of covert factories. In a sprawling warehouse where rock music blared, executives showed off their signature FP-1 exploding drones that can travel up to 1,600 kilometers (994 miles). They also touted publicly for the first time a cruise missile they are developing that is capable of traveling 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles), and which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hopes will be mass-produced by the end of the year.",
      "Even as U.S. President Donald Trump presses for an end to the 3 1/2-year war \u2014 and dangles the prospect of U.S. support for NATO-like security guarantees \u2014 Ukrainian defense officials say their country is determined to become more self-sufficient in deterring Russia.",

      "A case in point: Fire Point had initially sourced navigational equipment for its drones from a major Western firm, but before long Russia was able to disrupt their effectiveness using electronic warfare; so Fire Point developed its own software to outwit the enemy.",
      "Because defense companies are high-value targets for Russia, many operate underground or hidden within civilian centers to evade detection. Although they are guarded by air defenses, the strategy has the disadvantage of putting civilians at risk. Many Ukrainians have died in imprecise Russian attacks that were likely targeting weapons facilities. Entrepreneurs said the alternative is to operate openly and face attacks that would set back the war effort.",

      "Energy analysts say renewable sources have little to do with recent price hikes, which are based on increased demand, aging infrastructure and increasingly extreme weather events such as wildfires that are exacerbated by climate change.",
      "The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for energy-hungry data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. Increased use of electric vehicles also has boosted demand, even as the Trump administration and congressional Republicans move to restrict tax credits and other incentives for EV purchases approved under the Biden administration.",
      "Natural gas prices, meanwhile, are rising sharply amid increased exports to Europe and other international customers. More than 40% of U.S. electricity is generated by natural gas.",
      "Trump promised during the 2024 campaign to lower Americans\u2019 electric bills by 50%. Democrats have been quick to blame him for the price hikes, citing actions to hamstring clean energy in the sprawling tax-and-spending cut bill approved last month, as well as regulations since then to further restrict wind and solar power.",
      "\u201cNow more than ever, we need more energy, not less, to meet our increased energy demand and power our grid. Instead of increasing our energy supply Donald Trump is taking a sledgehammer to the clean energy sector, killing jobs and projects,\u201d said New Mexico Sen.

    "story": [
      "Both Wall Street and the White House will be paying close attention to Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s high-profile speech Friday at the Fed\u2019s annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming",
      "WASHINGTON -- Just three weeks ago, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke to reporters after the central bank had kept its key interest rate unchanged for a fifth straight meeting and said the job market was \u201csolid.\u201d",
      "His assessment was important because if the job market is healthy, there is less need for the Fed to cut its key interest rate, as President Donald Trump has demanded. Two days later, the Labor Department issued a report that cast doubt on that assessment, showing hiring was weak in July and much lower than previously estimated in May and June.",
      "So, there will be a lot of attention paid by Wall Street and the White House to Powell's high-profile speech Friday at the Fed's annual economic symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. If the famously data-dependent Powell shifts gears and takes a gloomier view of the job market, that could open the door for a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting in September.",
      "Powell could also stick to the cautious approach he's maintained all year and reiterate that the central bank needs more time to evaluate the impact of Trump's sweeping tariffs on inflation.",
      "Most economists expect Powell to signal that a rate cut is likely this year, but won\u2019t necessarily commit to one next month. That could disappoint Wall Street, which has put high odds on a September cut.",
      "Powell's speech, his last address at Jackson Hole as chair before his term ends in May, will occur against a particularly fraught backdrop. About a week after the jobs numbers, the latest inflation report showed that price growth crept higher in July. Core prices, which exclude the volatile food and energy categories, rose 3.1% from a year ago, above the Fed's 2% target.",
      "Stubbornly elevated inflation pushes the Fed in the opposite direction that weak hiring does: It suggests the central bank's short-term rate should stay at its current 4.3%, rather than be cut. That would mean other borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and business loans, would stay elevated.",
      "\u201cSo the plot has thickened,\u201d said David Wilcox, a former top Fed economist and now director of economic research at Bloomberg Economics and also a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. \u201cThe dilemma that the Fed is in has become, if anything, more intense.\u201d",
      "Powell is also navigating an unprecedented level of public criticism by Trump, as well as efforts by the president to take greater control of the Fed, which has long been independent from day-to-day politics.",
      "Most observers credit Powell for his nimble handling of the pressures. An iconic moment in his tenure was Trump's visit to tour the Fed's renovation of its office buildings last month. Trump had charged that Powell mismanaged the project, which had ballooned in cost to $2.5 billion, from an earlier estimate of $1.9 billion.",
      "With both the president and Fed chair in white hard hats on the building site, in front of cameras, Trump claimed the cost had mushroomed even further to $3.1 trillion. Powell shook his head, so Trump handed him a piece of paper purporting to back up his claim.",
      "Powell calmly dismissed the figure, noting that the $3.1 billion included the cost of renovating a third building five years earlier.",

      "For Powell, there's a difficult decision to make on interest rates. The Fed's \u201cdual mandate\u201d calls for it to keep prices stable while seeking maximum employment. But while the weak jobs data suggest the need for a cut, many Fed officials fear inflation will get worse in the coming months.",
      "\u201cThere is still a fair amount that\u2019s still outstanding,\u201d Raphael Bostic, president of the Fed's Atlanta branch, said in an interview, referring to tariff-led price hikes. \u201cOne feedback we\u2019ve gotten both in our surveys and from direct conversations (with businesses) suggests that many still are looking to see the price that they charge their customers increase from where we are today.\u201d",
      "Other economists, however, point to the sharp slowdown in housing as a sign of a weak economy. Sales of existing homes fell in June to their lowest level in nine months amid elevated mortgage rates. Consumer spending has also been modest this year, and growth was just 1.2% at an annual rate in the first half of 2025.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not a lot to like about the economy right now outside of AI,\" said Neil Dutta, an economist at Renaissance Macro. \u201cThe weakness in the economy isn't about tariffs,\u201d but instead the Fed's high rates, he added.",

      "ESPN is nearing a deal with Major League Baseball to distribute out-of-market games",
      "When ESPN opted out of its contract with Major League Baseball in February, the network was hoping to get a reworked package at a lower cost while Commissioner Rob Manfred thought the sport could optimize its rights in the short term for Home Run Derby and Wild Card round.",
      "In the end, both parties may get what they want.",
      "According to people familiar with negotiations, ESPN is nearing a deal to distribute out-of-market games while NBC/Peacock, Netflix, Apple TV are in talks for regular-season packages, the Wild Card round and Home Run Derby.",
      "All sides hope to have everything finalized by the end of the regular season next month, three people told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the contracts have not been finalized or announced by either side.",
      "The negotiations around the three-year deals is complicated due to the fact that MLB is also trying not to slight two of its other rights holders. MLB receives an average of $729 million from Fox and $470 million from Turner Sports per year under deals which expire after the 2028 season.",
      "While ESPN would be losing the playoffs and Home Run Derby, it would be gaining something it considers more valuable \u2014 the MLB.TV streaming package of out-of-market games as part of the direct-to-consumer service that launched on Thursday. ESPN would also sell the in-market rights to the five teams whose games are produced by MLB \u2014 San Diego, Colorado, Arizona, Cleveland and Minnesota.",
      "\u201cWe are engaged. We are having healthy conversations with them. Nothing to announce today, but we\u2019re very interested in baseball in general,\u201d ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro said on Tuesday during a presentation about the network's DTC service.",
      "ESPN, which has carried MLB games since 1990, opted out of the final three years of a seven-year deal in February. The package averaged $550 million per season and also included the Home Run Derby and Wild Card games.",
      "Baseball would be the second league that would have its out-of-market digital package available in the U.S. on ESPN\u2019s platform. The NHL moved its package to ESPN in 2021.",
      "It would also be a win-win situation for MLB and ESPN. Manfred wrote in a memo to owners after ESPN opted out of its contract: \u201cWhile ESPN has stated they would like to continue to have MLB on their platform, particularly in light of the upcoming launch of their DTC product, we do not think its beneficial for us to accept a smaller deal to remain on a shrinking platform. In order to best position MLB to optimize our rights going in to our next deal cycle, we believe it is not prudent to devalue our rights with an existing partner but rather to have our marquee regular season games, Home Run Derby and Wild Card playoff round on a new broadcast and/or streaming platform.\u201d",
      "The moves keep ESPN involved in baseball, but at a point where it can benefit while MLB could benefit from other partners in a short-term deal.",
      "There is a possibility that ESPN would still air 30 regular-season games, but not Sunday nights. That package of games would go to NBC/Peacock, along with the Wild Card round.",

      "The deals would also accomplish another of Manfred's goals. He has said for three years that he would like to see MLB take a more national approach to its rights instead of a large percentage of its games being on regional sports networks.",

      "Jon Ippolito, professor of new media at the University of Maine, said tech companies are constantly working to make chips and data centers more efficient, but that does not mean AI\u2019s environmental impact will shrink. That\u2019s because of a problem called the Jevons Paradox.",

He tells the AI to stop generating as soon as he has the answer to avoid wasting extra energy. He requests concise answers and he begins Google searches by typing \u201c-ai\u201d so it doesn't provide an AI overview for queries where he doesn't need it.",

      "Tommy Fleetwood and Patrick Cantlay share the lead going into what figures to be a thriller of a finish at the Tour Championship",
      "ATLANTA -- By the time Patrick Cantlay wrapped up his fourth birdie in the last five holes for a 6-under 64 to take the lead, and Tommy Fleetwood dried himself off from a double bogey with a pair of birdies for a 67 to catch him, the Tour Championship was left with tantalizing possibilities.",
      "At stake on the final day of the season was the FedEx Cup.",
      "And the Ryder Cup.",
      "There was Fleetwood, embracing yet another chance to get his first PGA Tour title. There was Scottie Scheffler, who wins all the time.",
      "And right in the thick of it was Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley, one of five Americans among the top nine players at East Lake under consideration for a captain's pick.",
      "As if he hasn't been weighing this possibility enough already, Bradley registered for the tournament next to a room celebrating the 1963 matches at East Lake. There was the bag of Arnold Palmer, the last one to be a playing captain.",
      "\u201cIt was really weird looking at it,\u201d Bradley said Saturday after a 63, which he called his best round of the year. \u201cLike really strange. Because I\u2019m nowhere in the world of Arnold Palmer and somehow I\u2019m in this with him right now.\u201d",
      "Saturday was plenty entertaining, even on a dreary day when rain was never far away.",
      "Fleetwood seized control with four straight birdies early, only to lose the lead when a 6-iron in the water on the 220-yard 15th hole, where the back tee and peninsula green added to 10 shots in the water \u2014 eight more than the opening two rounds combined.",
      "As he crouched to read his bogey putt, a video board in front of him showed him he was about to lose his lead \u2014 unaware Cantlay was about to bury a bending, 25-foot birdie on the 17th.",
      "\u201cIt was just one bad swing on a very tough hole and that\u2019s what can happen,\u201d Fleetwood said.",
      "He responded by hitting pitching wedge from a bunker to 12 feet for birdie and wedge to 9 feet for a birdie on the next, allowing him to catch Cantlay at 16-under 194.",
      "They were two shots ahead of Henley, who birdied the 18th for a 69.",
      "Fleetwood endured a two-shot swing on the final hole to Bradley that cost him at the Travelers Championship. He lost a two-shot lead with three to play at the FedEx St. Jude Championship. This is his third time with at least a share of the 54-hole lead in his last six events.",
      "All he wanted was another chance, and this is another great one.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what everybody wants,\u201d Fleetwood said. \u201cI am lucky enough that I get to be one of those guys, so I\u2019m having the time of my life out there and I\u2019m playing great and I\u2019ve got to enjoy it while it\u2019s happening. You never know.",

      "\u201cI\u2019m either going to win or I\u2019m not and we\u2019re going to know the picks,\u201d Bradley said. \u201cWe\u2019re pretty confident with the picks that we have. One more day of golf to kind of finalize this whole thing, and I can\u2019t wait. I\u2019m done with this whole process. I want it over with either way.\u201d",

      "Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion who will be eligible for her own enshrinement in 2027, drew gasps and shrieks from the crowd at the Newport shrine.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s a gift to have someone who motivates you to reach those heights. And I\u2019ll forever be grateful for bringing out the best in me,\" Sharapova said in her acceptance speech. \u201cWe both knew no other way than to fight our hearts out. ... We both hated to lose more than anything on this earth, and we both knew that the other was the biggest obstacle between ourselves and the trophy.\u201d",
      "The first Russian woman ever to reach No. 1 in the rankings and one of 10 women to complete the career Grand Slam, Sharapova was joined in the Class of 2025 by dominating doubles team Mike and Bob Bryan. The twin brothers finished their speech with one of their trademark chest bumps.",
      "Hall of Famers Martina Navratilova, Jim Courier, Stan Smith and Andy Roddick were among those in the crowd, wearing their blue Hall of Fame blazers. Sharapova and the Bryan brothers also received a cast tennis racket that is the hall\u2019s newest offering to inductees.",
      "Sharapova was described in her introductory video as someone who \u201ccombined grit with glamour,\u201d and some of the stylish outfits she competed in are already displayed in the hall \u2014 including a tuxedo-inspired dress she wore when she won Wimbledon in 2008.",

      "\u201cShe showed us all how to take excellence on the court and turn it into excellence in business, and fashion, branding and everything that she touched,\" Williams said. \u201cShe changed how women not only approached tennis, but sports and opportunity. She showed us that you can be fierce on the court and strategic off the court, and unapologetically herself the entire time.\u201d",
      "Sharapova said her induction gave her a chance to look back \u2014 something she tried not to do when she was playing. And she credited her success to \"embracing the struggles and leaning into the hard stuff.\u201d",

      "The quarterback who played his last college season at Minnesota in 2024 did nothing to hurt his chances at being the No. 3 behind McCarthy. Brosmer pulled the Vikings within 17-10 with a 21-yard TD pass to Bryson Nesbit in the third quarter and finished 15 of 23 for 161 yards.",

      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Canada are learning to live with great white sharks",
      "SCARBOROUGH, Maine -- Rick Clough spent some four decades fishing for lobsters and sea urchins off the Maine coast before spotting one of the ocean's most recognized predators \u2014 a great white shark.",
      "The approximately 8-foot (2.4-meter) shark, seen off the beach town of Scarborough in July, surprised Clough, but didn\u2019t make him fear the ocean \u2014 though he admitted, \u201cI\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to go urchin diving now.\u201d",
      "Boaters, beachgoers and fishermen like Clough who spend time in the chilly waters of New England and Atlantic Canada are learning to live with great white sharks, the creatures made famous by the 1975 film \u201cJaws.\u201d Sightings of the apex predators are up in places like Maine, where they were once very rarely spotted.",
      "Scientists link the white shark sightings to increased availability of the seals the sharks feast on, and say beachgoers are generally very safe from shark bites. The sharks can grow close to 20 feet (6 meters) long, though most don't get that big.",
      "David Lancaster, a commercial clam digger in Scarborough, used a drone to get a look at an approximately 12-foot (3.6-meter) shark near the town\u2019s famed beaches earlier this month. He described the animal as \u201cmagnificent\u201d and \u201creally amazing\u201d to see. But he also said the shark's presence reminded him that swimmers need to look out for the big fish.",
      "Sightings of great whites off Cape Cod, Massachusetts, have become increasingly frequent in recent years, and the Atlantic White Shark Conservancy has documented hundreds of the animals over more than a decade. But new data shows the sharks are heading even farther north into New Hampshire, Maine and beyond, said Greg Skomal, a senior fisheries biologist with the Massachusetts Department of Marine Fisheries and a veteran white shark researcher.",
      "The number of white sharks detected off Halifax, Nova Scotia, increased about 2.5 times from 2018 to 2022, according to a paper published by Skomal and others in May in the journal Marine Ecology Progress Series. Even farther north, the number detected in the Cabot Strait that separates Nova Scotia and Newfoundland increased nearly four times over, the paper said.",
      "Skomal said the average residency in these northern waters has also increased from 48 days to 70 days, suggesting that white sharks appear to be increasingly comfortable farther north.",
      "A key reason for the shift seems to be the successful conservation of seals off New England and Canada via laws such as the Marine Mammal Protection Act, which has allowed seals to thrive and provide a food source for the predatory sharks, Skomal said.",
      "\u201cIt could be a function of a growing prey base,\u201d Skomal said. \u201cAnd that would be seals.\u201d",
      "Great white sharks also benefit from protections, including a ban on fishing for them in U.S. federal waters that has stood since 1997. They are still considered vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.",
      "In Massachusetts, the marine fisheries department said it strengthened its fishing laws after fishermen in 2024 chose to target white sharks anyway. The state prohibited the use of certain kinds of heavy fishing gear in shoreline areas where white sharks are most commonly found.",

    "story": [
      "The voting technology company suing Fox News for defamation is now entangled in a widening bribery investigation",
      "MIAMI -- Smartmatic, the elections-technology company suing Fox News for defamation, is now contending with a growing list of criminal allegations against some of its executives \u2014 including a new claim by federal prosecutors that a \u201cslush fund\u201d for bribing foreign officials was financed partly with proceeds from the sale of voting machines in Los Angeles.",
      "The new details about the criminal case surfaced this month in court filings in Miami, where the company's co-founder, Roger Pinate, and two Venezuelan colleagues were charged last year with bribing officials in the Philippines in exchange for a contract to help run that country's 2016 presidential elections. Pinate, who no longer works for Smartmatic, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "To buttress the case, federal prosecutors are seeking to introduce evidence they argue shows that some of the nearly $300 million the company was paid by Los Angeles County to help modernize its voting systems was diverted to a fund controlled by Pinate through the use of overseas shell companies, fake invoices and other means.",
      "Smartmatic itself hasn't been charged with breaking any laws, nor have U.S. prosecutors accused Smartmatic or its executives of tampering with election results. Similarly, they haven't accused Los Angeles County officials of wrongdoing, or said whether they were even aware of the alleged bribery scheme. County officials say they weren\u2019t.",
      "But the case against Pinate is unfolding as Smartmatic is pursuing a $2.7 billion lawsuit accusing Fox of defamation for airing false claims that the company helped rig the 2020 U.S. presidential election. Fox says it was legitimately reporting newsworthy allegations.",
      "Smartmatic said the Justice Department\u2019s new filing was filled with \u201cmisrepresentations\u201d and is \u201cuntethered from reality.\u201d",
      "\u201cLet us be clear: Smartmatic wins business because we\u2019re the best at what we do,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe operate ethically and abide by all laws always, both in Los Angeles County and every jurisdiction where we operate.\u201d",
      "Still, Fox has gone to court to try to get more information about L.A. County's dealings with Smartmatic. The network has long tried to leverage the bribery allegations to undermine Smartmatic\u2019s narrative about its business prospects \u2013 a key component in calculating any potential damages \u2014 and portray it as a scandal-plagued company brought low by its own legal problems, not Fox's broadcasts.",
      "South Florida-based Smartmatic was founded more than two decades ago by a group of Venezuelans who found early success working for the government of the late Hugo Chavez, a devotee of electronic voting. The company later expanded globally, providing voting machines and other technology to help carry out elections in 25 countries, from Argentina to Zambia.",
      "It was awarded its contract to help with Los Angeles County elections in 2018. The contract, which Smartmatic continues to service, gave the company an important foothold in what was then a fast-expanding U.S. voting-technology market.",
      "But Smartmatic has said its business tanked after Fox News gave President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers a platform to paint the company as part of a conspiracy to steal the 2020 election.",
      "Fox itself eventually aired a piece refuting the allegations after Smartmatic\u2019s lawyers complained, but it has aggressively defended itself against the defamation lawsuit in New York.",
      "\u201cFacing imminent financial collapse and indictment, Smartmatic saw a litigation lottery ticket in Fox News\u2019s coverage of the 2020 election,\u201d the network\u2019s lawyers said in a court filing.",
      "Smartmatic has disputed Fox's characterization in court filings as \u201clies\u201d and \u201canother attempt to divert attention from its long-standing campaign of falsehoods and defamation.\"",

      "Fox's lawyers also questioned Logan in a deposition about a dinner a Smartmatic executive bought for him at the members-only Magic Castle club and restaurant in Los Angeles and a Smartmatic-paid trip that Logan made to Taiwan in 2019 to oversee the manufacturing of equipment by a Smartmatic vendor. U.S. prosecutors claim that vendor was deeply involved in the alleged kickback scheme in the Philippines. The five-day trip included business class airfare, hotel and numerous meals as well as time for sightseeing, Fox said.",
      "\u201cThe trip\u2019s itinerary demonstrates that the trip was not a financial inspection or audit. It was a boondoggle,\u201d Fox said in court filings.",
      "Logan, who did not report the gifts in his financial disclosures, said in his 2023 deposition that the meal at the Magic Castle was a \u201csocial occasion\u201d unrelated to business and that he was not required to report the trip to Taiwan because his visit was covered by the contract.",
      "Mike Sanchez, a spokesman for Logan's office, said in a statement that the bribery allegations are unrelated to the company\u2019s work for L.A. County and that the county had no knowledge of how the proceeds from its contract would be used. All of Smartmatic\u2019s work has been evaluated for compliance with the contract\u2019s terms, Sanchez added, and as soon as Pinate was indicted he and the other defendants were banned from conducting business with the county.",
      "As for the trip to Taiwan, Sanchez said another county official joined Logan for the trip and the two conducted several on-site visits and conducted detailed reviews of electoral technology products that were required prior the start of their manufacturing. Logan's spouse accompanied him on the trip, but at the couple's own expense, the spokesman added.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, this is an attempt to use the County as a pawn in two serious legal actions to which the County is not a party,\u201d Sanchez said.",
      "Smartmatic has settled two other defamation lawsuits it brought against conservative news outlets Newsmax and One America News Network over their 2020 U.S. election coverage. Settlement terms weren\u2019t disclosed.",
      "U.S. prosecutors in Miami have also accused Pinate of secretly bribing Venezuela's longtime election chief by giving her a luxury home with a pool in Caracas. Prosecutors say the home was transferred to the election chief in an attempt to repair relations following Smartmatic's abrupt exit from Venezuela in 2017 when it accused President Nicolas Maduro 's government of manipulating tallied results in elections for a rubber-stamping constituent assembly.",
      "Smartmatic has denied the bribery allegations, saying it ceased all operations in Venezuela in 2017 after blowing the whistle on the government and has never sought to secure business there again.",
      "\"There are no slush funds, no gifted house,\" the company said. Instead, it accused Fox of engaging in \u201cvictim-blaming\u201d and attempts to use \u201cfrivolous\u201d court filings \u201cto smear us further, twisting unproven Justice Department allegations.\u201d",

      "BANGKOK -- Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said Friday that the company is discussing a potential new computer chip designed for China with the Trump administration.",
      "Huang was asked about a possible \u201cB30A\u201d semiconductor for artificial intelligence data centers for China while on a visit to Taiwan, where he was meeting Nvidia's key manufacturing partner, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp., the world's largest chip maker.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m offering a new product to China for ... AI data centers, the follow-on to H20,\u201d Huang said. But he added that \"That\u2019s not our decision to make. It\u2019s up to, of course, the United States government. And we\u2019re in dialogue with them, but it\u2019s too soon to know.\u201d",
      "Such chips are graphics processing units, or GPUs, a type of device used to build and update a range of AI systems. But they are less powerful than Nvidia\u2019s top semiconductors today, which cannot be sold to China due to U.S. national security restrictions.",
      "The B30A, based on California-based Nvidia's specialized Blackwell technology, is reported to operate at about half the speed of Nvidia's main B300 chips.",
      "Huang praised the the Trump administration for recently approving sales of Nvidia\u2019s H20 chips to China after such business was suspended in April, with the proviso that the company must pay a 15% tax to the U.S. government on those sales. Chip maker Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, was told to pay the same tax on its sales of its MI380 chips to China.",
      "As part of broader trade talks, Beijing and Washington recently agreed to pull back some non-tariff restrictions. China approved more permits for rare earth magnets to be exported to the U.S., while Washington lifted curbs on chip design software and jet engines. After lobbying by Huang, it also allowed sales of the H20 chips to go through.",

      "Speaking with reporters on Friday, Trump said the deal came out of a meeting last week with Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan \u2014 which came days after the president called for Tan to resign over his past ties to China.",
      "\u201cI said, I think it would be good having the United States as your partner,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe agreed, and they\u2019ve agreed to do it.\u201d",
      "Intel did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the agreement.",
      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The official announcement is expected to come later Friday, according to a White House official who was not authorized to speak publicly ahead of an announcement and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under President Joe Biden. If the deal is completed, the U.S. government would become one of Intel\u2019s largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world\u2019s largest economy.",
      "In his second term, Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Trump\u2019s interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country\u2019s dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",

      "That\u2019s what the president said August 7 in an unequivocal post calling for Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan\u2019s past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist. But Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S. in a public letter to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \u201camazing story.\u201d",
      "The company isn\u2019t commenting about the possibility of the U.S. government becoming a major shareholder, but Intel may have little choice because it is currently dealing from a position of weakness. After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone\u2019s 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Although rare, it\u2019s not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy.

      "U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel\u2019s business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company.

      "PARIS -- The death of a French streamer during an extended broadcast has prompted soul-searching and controversy as a government minister said Rapha\u00ebl Graven had been \u201chumiliated and mistreated for months\" on air and a judicial investigation delves into alleged abuse.",
      "Graven, 46, also known as Jean Pormanove, died on Monday in Nice during a broadcast on the Kick livestreaming platform that had been running for more than 298 hours. French media reported the broadcast was interrupted soon after Pormanove\u2019s co-streamers found him unconscious and lying on a bed.",
      "Damien Martinelli, the prosecutor in the southern French city, said in a statement that the autopsy carried out on Thursday showed the death was not caused by a trauma and \u201cnot related\" to the intervention of any third party. Some additional medical and toxicological analyses have been ordered, he said.",
      "Pormanove's death came as a judicial investigation was already underway into alleged violence and humiliations committed against him, prompted by reports from French investigative website Mediapart about what it described as the \u201conline abuse business.\u201d Mediapart said co-streamers were allegedly mistreating Pormanove in live broadcasts, sometimes encouraged by payments from viewers, to generate more subscriptions and money.",
      "The investigation, opened in December, is looking into \u201cdeliberate violence against vulnerable persons\u201d and \u201cspreading recordings of images related to offenses involving deliberate violations of physical integrity,\" Martinelli's statement said. It did not specify why Pormanove could be considered vulnerable.",
      "The statement said two co-streamers allegedly involved in the case were briefly taken into custody in January but were released pending further investigation.",
      "In parallel, the Nice prosecutor said, investigators interviewed Pormanove and one of his co-streamers who both appeared to be victims of violence and humiliation. They \"strongly denied being victims of violence, stating that the events were staged in order to \u2018generate a buzz\u2019 and make money.\u201d",
      "Pormanove's death prompted strong reactions on social media as many users questioned the authorities' failure to act.",

      "Kentucky is one of 17 states and the District of Columbia starting this school year with new restrictions, bringing the total to 35 states with laws or rules limiting phones and other electronic devices in school. This change has come remarkably quickly: Florida became the first state to pass such a law in 2023.",

      "Phones are banned throughout the school day in 18 of the states and the District of Columbia, although Georgia and Florida impose such \u201cbell-to-bell\u201d bans only from kindergarten through eighth grade. Another seven states ban them during class time, but not between classes or during lunch. Still others, particularly those with traditions of local school control, mandate only a cellphone policy, believing districts will take the hint and sharply restrict phone access.",
      "For students, the rules add new school-day rituals, like putting phones in magnetic pouches or special lockers.",
      "Students have been locking up their phones during class at McNair High School in suburban Atlanta since last year. Audreanna Johnson, a junior, said \u201cmost of them did not want to turn in their phones\u201d at first, because students would use them to gossip, texting \u201ctheir other friends in other classes to see what\u2019s the tea and what\u2019s going on around the building.\u201d",
      "That resentment is \u201cstarting to ease down\u201d now, she said. \"More students are willing to give up their phones and not get distracted.\u201d",

      "China has released new interim measures to tighten controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets",
      "BANGKOK -- China released new interim measures Friday tightening controls on mining and processing of rare earths that are used in many high-tech products including electric vehicles, smartphones and fighter jets.",
      "The rules released Friday by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology apply both to rare earths originating in China and those that are sent to China for refining.",
      "They require companies to comply with quotas for various minerals. Companies must have government approval to deal with rare earths and must accurately report the amount of rare earths products being handled. Violators will face legal penalties and also have their quotas for rare earths reduced.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "The 17 rare earth elements, including such minerals as germanium, gallium and titanium, aren\u2019t actually rare. But they're hard to find in a high enough concentration to make mining them worth the investment. China has been gradually tightening restrictions on exports of such materials, partly in response to U.S. controls on its access to American advanced technology.",
      "In April, just after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a raft of tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners, Beijing announced permitting requirements for seven more rare earths: samarium, gadolinium, terbium, dysprosium, lutetium, scandium and yttrium, citing the need to \u201cbetter safeguard national security and interests and to fulfill global duties of non-proliferation.\u201d",
      "Those limits raised worries that manufacturers in the U.S. and elsewhere would run short of vital materials needed for production, an issue in China-U.S. trade talks. In response to U.S. concessions on access to computer chip design software and jet engines, Beijing announced in June that it was speeding up approvals of rare earths exports.",
      "In July, China\u2019s Ministry of State Security said it was cracking down on alleged smuggling of rare earths materials that it said threatened national security, indicating Beijing was moving to exert more control.",
      "Over the past several decades, China has come to dominate rare earths processing. It now supplies nearly 90% of the world\u2019s rare earths, even though it mines only about 70% of such materials.",
      "China holds nearly half of the world's known reserves of rare earths, but it also imports significant amounts of rare earths from neighboring Myanmar for processing and export.",
      "Since it controls technologies used for refining rare earth elements and has banned exporting that know-how, China holds a near-monopoly on smelting and separating them.",

Some of the elements obtained from non-Chinese intermediate sources came from mineral concentrates processed in China and Australia, according to the U.S. Geologic Survey.",
      "China has agreed to issue some permits for rare earth exports but not for military uses, and much uncertainty remains about their supply.",
      "The rules released Friday spell out tighter controls on licensing of companies dealing in rare earths and centralize controls on mining, exports and processing. They also impose more stringent environmental standards for the industry.",
      "Trump has made it a priority to try to reduce American reliance on China for rare earths, while pushing for Beijing to ease its controls.",
      "China has opted to dial up or down the approval process as needed, while tightening overall controls on the industry.",
      "The new regulations don't spell out the quotas for production and export or specific rare earths elements, but strongly suggest Beijing is serious about exerting stronger control over the industry.",

      "Congress approved a U.S. ban on TikTok unless its parent company, ByteDance, sold its controlling stake. But Trump has so far extended the deadline three times during his second term \u2014 with the next one coming up on Sept. 17.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re gonna watch the security concerns,\u201d Trump told reporters, but added, \u201cWe have buyers, American-buyers,\u201d and \u201cuntil the complexity of things work out, we just extend a little bit longer.\u201d",
      "The first extension was through an executive order on Jan. 20, his first day in office, after the platform went dark briefly when a national ban \u2014 approved by Congress and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 took effect. The second was in April, when White House officials believed they were nearing a deal to spin off TikTok into a new company with U.S. ownership that fell apart after China backed out following Trump\u2019s tariff announcement.",
      "His comments follow the White House starting a TikTok account this week.",
      "\u201cI used TikTok in the campaign,\u201d Trump said.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a fan of TikTok,\u201d he said. \u201cMy kids like TikTok. Young people love TikTok. If we could keep it going.\u201d",

      "Giraffes are now classified into four distinct species in Africa",
      "WASHINGTON -- Giraffes are a majestic sight in Africa with their long necks and distinctive spots. Now it turns out there are four different giraffe species on the continent, according to a new scientific analysis released Thursday.",
      "Researchers previously considered all giraffes across Africa to belong to a single species. New data and genetic studies have led a task force of the International Union for Conservation of Nature to split the tallest mammal on land into four groups \u2014 Northern giraffes, reticulated giraffes, Masai giraffes and Southern giraffes.",
      "Key studies have emerged in the past decade highlighting significant differences between the four species, said the IUCN\u2019s Michael Brown, a researcher in Windhoek, Namibia, who led the assessment.",
      "Naming different giraffes matters because \u201ceach species has different population sizes, threats and conservation needs,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you lump giraffes all together, it muddies the narrative.\u201d",
      "Northern giraffes \u2014 whose range includes parts of Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Central African Republic \u2013 face threats from political instability and poaching. Masai giraffes in Kenya and Tanzania face pressure from habitat loss, as open savannas are converted to cattle pastures and fields.",
      "Considering four giraffe species \u201cis absolutely the right decision, and it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d said Stuart Pimm, a Duke University ecologist who wasn\u2019t involved in the analysis.",
      "While in the past researchers scrutinized giraffes\u2019 spots, the new categories made use of newer methods including extensive analysis of genetic data and studies highlighting key anatomical differences, such as skull shape.",
      "What appear like horns sticking up from the foreheads of giraffes are actually permanent bony protrusions from the skull, different from deer antlers that are shed annually.",
      "Over the past 20 years, scientists have also gathered genetic samples from more than 2,000 giraffes across Africa to study the differences, said Stephanie Fennessy at the nonprofit Giraffe Conservation Foundation, who helped in the research.",

      "\u201cFamine is, in plain language, not having enough to eat,\u201d Manary said.",
      "IPC, the leading international authority on hunger crises, considers an area to be in famine when three things occur: 20% of households have an extreme lack of food, or essentially are starving; at least 30% of children suffer from acute malnutrition or wasting, meaning they\u2019re too thin for their height; and two adults or four children per every 10,000 people are dying daily of hunger and its complications.",

      "When people don\u2019t have enough to eat, Manary said, the first thing that happens is the body uses up its reserves.",

      "Museum researchers are using a variety of records to piece together those histories, focusing on where and when the remains were collected, but they are not employing DNA analysis. In some cases, the museum has information about the person that was recorded by the physician who collected the specimen.",
      "\u201cThe goal is not finding an identity for finding an identity\u2019s sake,\u201d Ray said. \u201cThe goal is to find an identity so that we can build a richer biographical profile, through which we can then ask questions about the way that this person navigated the world. And so that\u2019s going to look very different for every single specimen.\u201d",
      "The museum's new human remains policy says that many were \u201cobtained in unacceptable circumstances including through force or duress\u201d and may have been used for research or in displays that are now considered to be examples of scientific racism.",
      "About 50 of its specimens are thought to be of Native American people. Since April 2024, nine remains have been repatriated to two tribes and one Native Hawaiian group.",
      "The remains will not be loaned out to other institutions, and research access to them must be approved by a group consisting of several top museum leaders. Research involving the collection tends to be about the history of medicine, not for purely biological study.",
      "The policy changes follow a two-year review, designed to engage the public in planning for the museum's future. As a result, hundreds of the museum\u2019s videos regarding items in the collection and on educational topics that were removed from YouTube in January 2023 are being restored to the streaming service after being reorganized, with out-of-date material removed.",

      "Erin lost some strength Tuesday and dropped to a Category 2 hurricane as it moves northward roughly parallel to the East Coast. However it could get stronger again on Thursday before finally weakening by Friday, the National Hurricane Center in Miami said. It had maximum sustained winds of 100 mph (155 kph) as of Wednesday morning.",
      "The hurricane was about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and 560 miles ( 901 kilometers) southwest of Bermuda as of Wednesday morning. Forecasters said Erin was moving north-northwest at 13 mph (21 kph).",
      "Although the weather center was confident Erin would not make direct landfall in the United States, authorities have warned that water conditions along the East Coast remain dangerous. Beachgoers were cautioned against swimming due to life-threatening surf and rip currents.",

      "Erin poses the biggest threat to the barrier islands of North Carolina\u2019s Outer Banks. Gov. Josh Stein declared a state of emergency Tuesday in advance of the storm, delegating powers to government officials to mobilize workers and equipment along the coast.",
      "The governor said the storm is expected to bring tropical storm force winds, dangerous waves and rip currents to the state. Tropical storm conditions were expected to begin Wednesday.",
      "At least 75 people were rescued from rip currents through Tuesday in Wrightsville Beach, near Wilmington, North Carolina, officials said.",
      "Evacuations were ordered on Hatteras Island and Ocracoke Island on the Outer Banks. The orders come at the height of tourist season on the thin stretch of low-lying barrier islands that juts far into the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "There are concerns that several days of heavy surf, high winds and waves could wash out parts of the main highway running along the barrier islands, the National Weather Service said. Some routes could be impassible for several days.",
      "Warnings about rip currents have been posted from Bermuda and Florida all the way up to the New England coast.",
      "Nantucket is the closest spot in New England to Erin\u2019s anticipated path and was likely to see the strongest winds, gusting about 25 to 35 mph (40 to 55 kph) at peak with waves potentially reaching a height of 10-13 feet (3-4 meters).",
      "Citing treacherous waters, officials prohibited swimming at all beaches in New York City as well as some in Long Island and New Jersey through Thursday.",
      "Bermuda won\u2019t feel the full intensity of the storm until Thursday evening, and the island\u2019s services will remain open in the meantime, acting Minister of National Security Jache Adams said. Storm surge could reach up to 24 feet (7.3 meters) by Thursday, Adams said.",

      "Outer space has emerged as the world's next battlefield, demonstrated by recent cyberattacks on satellites blamed on Russia",
      "WASHINGTON -- As Russia held its Victory Day parade this year, hackers backing the Kremlin hijacked an orbiting satellite that provides television service to Ukraine.",
      "Instead of normal programing, Ukrainian viewers saw parade footage beamed in from Moscow: waves of tanks, soldiers and weaponry. The message was meant to intimidate, and it was also an illustration that 21st century war is waged not just on land, sea and air but also in cyberspace and the reaches of outer space.",
      "Disabling a satellite could deal a devastating blow without a single bullet, and it can be done by targeting the satellite's security software or disrupting its ability to send or receive signals from Earth.",
      "\u201cIf you can impede a satellite's ability to communicate, you can cause a significant disruption,\u201d said Tom Pace, CEO of NetRise, a cybersecurity firm focused on protecting supply chains. He served in the Marines before working on cyber issues at the Department of Energy.",
      "\u201cThink about GPS,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine if a population lost that, and the confusion it would cause.\u201d",
      "More than 12,000 operating satellites now orbit the planet, playing a critical role not just in broadcast communications but also in military operations, navigation systems like GPS, intelligence gathering and economic supply chains. They are also key to early launch-detection efforts, which can warn of approaching missiles.",
      "That makes them a significant national security vulnerability, and a prime target for anyone looking to undermine an adversary's economy or military readiness \u2014 or to deliver a psychological blow like the hackers supporting Russia did when they hijacked television signals to Ukraine.",
      "Hackers typically look for the weakest link in the software or hardware that supports a satellite or controls its communications with Earth. The actual orbiting device may be secure, but if it's running on outdated software, it can be easily exploited.",
      "As Russian forces invaded Ukraine in 2022, someone targeted Viasat, the U.S.-based satellite company used by Ukraine's government and military. The hack, which Kyiv blamed on Moscow, used malware to infect tens of thousands of modems, creating an outage affecting wide swaths of Europe.",
      "National security officials say Russia is developing a nuclear, space-based weapon designed to take out virtually every satellite in low-Earth orbit at once. The weapon would combine a physical attack that would ripple outward, destroying more satellites, while the nuclear component is used to fry their electronics.",
      "U.S. officials declassified information about the weapon after Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, issued a public warning about the technology. Turner has pushed for the Department of Defense to provide a classified briefing to lawmakers on the weapon, which, if deployed, would violate an international treaty prohibiting weapons of mass destruction in space.",
      "Turner said such a weapon could render low-Earth orbit unusable for satellites for as long as a year. If it were used, the effects would be devastating: potentially leaving the U.S. and its allies vulnerable to economic upheaval and even a nuclear attack.",
      "Russia and China also would lose satellites, though they are believed to be less reliant on the same kinds of satellites as the U.S.",
      "Turner compared the weapon, which is not yet ready for deployment, to Sputnik, the Russian satellite that launched the space age in 1957.",
      "\u201cIf this anti-satellite nuclear weapon would be put in space, it would be the end of the space age,\u201d Turner said. \u201cIt should never be permitted to go into outer space. This is the Cuban Missile Crisis in space.\u201d",

      "Minnesota has joined a wave of states suing TikTok, claiming the app uses addictive algorithms that harm young people's mental health",
      "ST. PAUL, Minn. -- Minnesota on Tuesday joined a wave of states suing TikTok, alleging the social media giant preys on young people with addictive algorithms that trap them into becoming compulsive consumers of its short videos.",
      "\u201cThis isn\u2019t about free speech. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re gonna holler that,\" Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said at a news conference. \"It\u2019s actually about deception, manipulation, misrepresentation. This is about a company knowing the dangers, and the dangerous effects of its product, but making and taking no steps to mitigate those harms or inform users of the risks.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit, filed in state court, alleges that TikTok is violating Minnesota laws against deceptive trade practices and consumer fraud. It follows a flurry of lawsuits filed by more than a dozen states last year alleging the popular short-form video app is designed to be addictive to kids and harms their mental health. Minnesota's case brings the total to about 24 states, Ellison's office said.",
      "Many of the earlier lawsuits stemmed from a nationwide investigation into TikTok launched in 2022 by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general from 14 states into the effects of TikTok on young users\u2019 mental health. Ellison, a Democrat, said Minnesota waited while it did its own investigation.",
      "Sean Padden, a middle-school health teacher in the Roseville Area school district, joined Ellison, saying he has witnessed a correlation between increased TikTok use and an \u201cirrefutable spike in student mental health issues,\u201d including depression, anxiety, anger, lowered self-esteem and a decrease in attention spans as they seek out the quick gratification that its short videos offer.",
      "The lawsuit comes while President Donald Trump is still trying to broker a deal to bring the social media platform, which is owned by China\u2019s ByteDance, under American ownership over concerns about the data security of its 170 million American users. While Trump campaigned on banning TikTok, he also gained more than 15 million followers on the platform since he started sharing videos on it.",
      "No matter who ultimately owns TikTok, Ellison said, it must comply with the law.",

      "\"Through our Family Pairing tool, parents can view or customize 20+ content and privacy settings, including screen time, content filters, and our time away feature to pause a teen\u2019s access to our app,\u201d Brown added.",
      "Minnesota is seeking a declaration that TikTok's practices are deceptive, unfair or unconscionable under state law, a permanent injunction against those practices, and up to $25,000 for each instance in which a Minnesota child has accessed TikTok. Ellison wouldn't put a total on that but said, \u201cit's a lot.\u201d He estimated that \u201chundreds of thousands of Minnesota kids\u201d have TikTok on their devices.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to shut them down, but we are insisting that they clean up their act,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThere are legitimate uses of products like TikTok. But like all things, they have to be used properly and safely.\u201d",
      "Minnesota is also among dozens of U.S. states that have sued Meta Platforms for allegedly building features into Instagram and Facebook that addict people. The messaging service Snapchat and the gaming platform Roblox are also facing lawsuits by some other states alleging harm to kids.",

Lifting restrictions on them, seizing the $300 billion of frozen reserves and European countries of Russian money, giving it to Ukraine. More sanctions on Russia, even including the Gazprom bank, and curtailing the export of oil further than we have already,\u201d Petraeus said.",

      "\u201cI think it has to be a concern. Obviously, it's unprecedented. There's never been anything like this,\u201d Petraeus said. \u201cThere have been cases in the past where individuals who've gotten crosswise with the president or with the secretary of defense certainly, usually on a policy issue in which they should not have spoken out and indeed were replaced. But the numbers here obviously are much more significant than that.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said Friday it will not defend a decades-old grant program for colleges with large numbers of Hispanic students that is being challenged in court, declaring the government believes the funding is unconstitutional.",
      "In a memo sent to Congress, the Justice Department said it agrees with a lawsuit attempting to strike down grants that are reserved for colleges and universities where at least a quarter of undergraduates are Hispanic. Congress created the program in 1998 after finding Latino students were attending college and graduating at far lower rates than white students.",
      "Justice Department officials argued the program provides an unconstitutional advantage based on race or ethnicity.",
      "The state of Tennessee and an anti-affirmative action organization sued the U.S. Education Department in June, asking a judge to halt the Hispanic-Serving Institution program. Tennessee argued all of its public universities serve Hispanic students, but none meet the \u201carbitrary ethnic threshold\u201d to be eligible for the grants. Those schools miss out on tens of millions of dollars because of discriminatory requirements, the lawsuit said.",
      "On Friday, the Justice Department released a letter in which Solicitor General D. John Sauer notified Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson that the department \u201chas decided not to defend\u201d the program, saying certain aspects of it are unconstitutional. The letter, dated July 25, cited the 2023 Supreme Court decision outlawing affirmative action, which said \u201coutright racial balancing\u201d is \u201cpatently unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Tennessee is backed in the suit by Students for Fair Admissions, a conservative legal group that successfully challenged affirmative action in admissions at Harvard and the University of North Carolina. That suit led to a 2023 Supreme Court ruling that forbids universities from considering students\u2019 race in admissions decisions.",
      "Edward Blum, president of Students for Fair Admissions, said Friday the group would decline to comment.",
      "More than 500 colleges and universities are designated as Hispanic-Serving Institutions, making them eligible for the grant program. Congress appropriated about $350 million for the program in 2024. Colleges compete for the grants, which can go toward a range of uses, from building improvements to science programs.",
      "Former President Joe Biden made Hispanic-serving universities a priority, signing an executive action last year that promised a new presidential advisory board and increased funding. President Donald Trump revoked the order his first day in office.",
      "Trump is taking steps to dismantle the Education Department and has called for massive funding cuts, yet his 2026 budget request preserved grants for Hispanic-serving colleges and even asked Congress for a slight increase. Even so, there have been doubts about his administration\u2019s commitment to the funding.",
      "A national association of Hispanic-serving universities filed a motion last month to intervene as a defendant in the Tennessee lawsuit, voicing concern that the federal government would not adequately represent the group\u2019s members.",
      "The Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities said Trump\u2019s agenda is \u201centirely adverse\u201d to the group\u2019s interests, citing the president\u2019s aim to close the Education Department entirely. The administration is \u201con record denouncing programs like HSIs, that take account of and seek to redress ethnic or racial disparity,\u201d the group wrote.",

      "Hawaii\u2019s Kilauea volcano has resumed its eruption by shooting an arc of lava high into the air and across a section of its summit crater floor",
      "HONOLULU -- Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed erupting Friday by shooting an arc of lava 100 feet (30 meters) into the air and across a section of its summit crater floor.",
      "It was Kilauea's 31st display of molten rock since December, an appropriately high frequency for one of the world's most active volcanoes.",
      "The north vent at the summit crater began continuously spattering in the morning, and then lava overflowed a few hours later. The vent started shooting lava fountains in the afternoon.",
      "The eruption was contained within the summit crater, and no homes were threatened.",
      "A few lucky residents and visitors will have a front-row view at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. If the past is a guide, hundreds of thousands more will be watching popular livestreams made possible by three camera angles set up by the U.S. Geological Survey.",
      "Whenever she gets word the lava is back, Park Service volunteer Janice Wei hustles to shoot photos and videos of Halemaumau Crater \u2014 which Native Hawaiian tradition says is the home to the volcano goddess Pele. She said that when the molten rock shoots high like a fountain, it sounds like a roaring jet engine or crashing ocean waves. She can feel its heat from over a mile away.",
      "\u201cEvery eruption feels like I am sitting in the front row at nature\u2019s most extraordinary show,\u201d Wei said in an email.",
      "Kilauea is on Hawaii Island, the largest of the Hawaiian archipelago. It\u2019s about 200 miles (320 kilometers) south of the state\u2019s largest city, Honolulu, which is on Oahu.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about Kilauea\u2019s latest eruption:",
      "A lower magma chamber under Halemaumau Crater is receiving magma directly from the earth\u2019s interior at about 5 cubic yards (3.8 cubic meters) per second, said Ken Hon, scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory. This blows the chamber up like a balloon and forces magma into an upper chamber. From there it gets pushed above ground through cracks.",
      "Magma has been using the same pathway to rise to the surface since December, making the initial release and subsequent episodes all part of the same eruption, Hon said.",
      "Many have featured lava soaring into the air, in some cases more than 1,000 feet (300 meters). The fountains are generated in part because magma \u2014 which holds gases that are released as it rises \u2014 has been traveling to the surface through narrow, pipelike vents.",
      "The expanding magma supply is capped by heavier magma that had expelled its gas at the end of the prior episode. Eventually enough new magma accumulates to force the degassed magma off, and the magma shoots out like a Champagne bottle that was shaken before the cork was popped.",
      "This is the fourth time in 200 years that Kilauea has shot lava fountains into the air in repeated episodes. There were more episodes the last time Kilauea followed this pattern: The eruption that began in 1983 started with 44 sessions of shooting fountains. Those were spread out over three years, however. And the fountains emerged in a remote area, so few got to watch.",
      "The other two occurred in 1959 and 1969.",
      "Scientists don\u2019t know how the current eruption will end or how it may change. In 1983 magma built enough pressure that Kilauea opened a vent at a lower elevation and started continuously leaking lava from there rather than periodically shooting out of a higher elevation. The eruption continued in various forms for three decades and ended in 2018.",

      "A federal judge has ruled that religious colleges in Minnesota that require students to sign a statement of faith cannot be excluded from a program allowing high school students to take college courses for credit",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Religious colleges that require students to sign a statement of faith cannot be excluded from a popular Minnesota program that lets high school students take college courses for credit, a federal judge has ruled, tossing a state law that she called an unconstitutional violation of religious freedom.",
      "The ruling late Friday from U.S. District Judge Nancy Brasel was a victory for two conservative Christian colleges in the state: Crown College in St. Bonifacius and the University of Northwestern in Roseville. Those two institutions require their students to pledge to follow the school\u2019s values and conduct rules, effectively barring students who aren\u2019t Christian or who are LGBTQ+ from campus activities.",
      "The 2023 law was sought by the state Department of Education and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights. In defending the change at a hearing in December, the state argued that it rightly protected high school students who are not Christian, straight, and cisgender \u2014 those whose gender identity matches the sex they were assigned at birth.",
      "Minnesota's 40-year-old Postsecondary Enrollment Options program lets high schoolers earn free credits at state expense at public or private colleges of their choice, although the courses must be nonsectarian. Around 60,000 students have participated.",
      "The Department of Education had tried to ban the faith statement requirement since 2019. It succeeded in 2023 when Democrats gained control of both houses of the Legislature and used their power to enact broad new protections for LGBTQ+ rights. The change was part of a broader education funding bill.",
      "A group of parents and high schoolers who were earning college credits at the two schools, or wanted to, then sued to overturn the law, saying it violated their religious freedom under the First Amendment to benefit from the program at schools with campus atmospheres that reflect their values.",
      "They were represented by The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, which welcomed the ruling.",
      "\u201cMinnesota tried to cut off educational opportunities to thousands of high schoolers simply for their faith. That\u2019s not just unlawful \u2014 it\u2019s shameful,\" Diana Thomson, senior counsel at Becket, said in a statement Saturday. \"This ruling is a win for families who won\u2019t be strong-armed into abandoning their beliefs, and a sharp warning to politicians who target them.\u201d",

      "Besides declaring the faith statement ban unconstitutional, Brasel also threw out a related nondiscrimination requirement that prohibited participating schools from basing admission to the program on the basis of gender, sexual orientation or religious beliefs.",
      "Both sides agreed earlier that the ban would not be enforced while the court case and any appeals played out.",
      "In 2021, Northwestern was Minnesota\u2019s largest provider of classes through the Postsecondary Enrollment Options program. The state paid it over $33 million in the academic years from 2017\u201318 through 2022\u201323. Crown got nearly $6 million in that period.",

      "On Monday, a state court judge threw out a 2024 ban on \u201cbinary triggers,\u201d devices that let a gun fire both when its trigger is pulled and when it's released, giving the weapon a much faster rate of fire.

      "The push to redraw congressional maps in Texas is shifting the dynamics of the state\u2019s 2026 Senate campaign",
      "HOUSTON -- Just as Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Colin Allred was holding a town hall near the Mexican border as part of an \u201cunrig Texas\u201d campaign tour, the state\u2019s Democratic fundraising powerhouse Beto O\u2019Rourke rallied support in Austin for lawmakers who left the state to delay a redistricting plan led by President Donald Trump. The next morning, one of those wayward lawmakers, James Talarico, stood in the pulpit at former President Barack Obama\u2019s old church in Chicago to say he and his fellow legislators had simply taken a leap of faith.",
      "All three Democrats are either declared or potential contenders for the Senate seat on the ballot in next year's midterm elections. In what would typically be a quiet period in Texas politics, Republicans have roiled the state's 2026 Senate campaign with their rush to redraw congressional maps to give Trump more allies in Congress. The turmoil impacts contenders in both parties and gives Democrats fresh hope that they can capture a long-elusive seat, where an upset would dramatically improve their chances of regaining Senate control in Washington.",
      "For Democrats, the GOP power play offers a new way to stand out as fighters against Trump and his Make America Great Again movement.",
      "For Republicans, including incumbent Sen. John Cornyn, it\u2019s a Trump loyalty test. Cornyn publicly called for involving the FBI in rounding up the defiant Democrats. His main primary challenger, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, used his current office to ask state courts to remove departed lawmakers from office and to jail O\u2019Rourke for raising funds to support the Democratic legislators. The clash has also been a welcome distraction from recent questions about Paxton's private life.",
      "Trump, meanwhile, had his eyes on the U.S. House when he openly prodded Texas Republicans this summer to give him five more GOP seats in a state he won handily last year. He hoped to avoid losing a slim House majority, as he did during his first term in 2018.",
      "Democrats nationwide condemned the effort to alter the playing field, in part because it comes before the typical 10-year timeline for redrawing congressional districts based on census results.",
      "Texas Democrats walked out for two weeks, denying Republicans the quorum they needed. They ended the walkout this week, but only after California Gov. Gavin Newsom countered with a redistricting push in his state, a Democratic stronghold.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got to stand up to them. These people are thugs,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said in an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cGiving in or seeking compromise, or trying to make concessions in the hopes that they\u2019ll stop pursuing you, that stuff clearly does not work. The only thing that works is fighting.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Rourke, a former congressman and onetime presidential candidate who has run and lost against U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, said he has not decided whether he will launch a senatorial bid.",
      "Paxton has assumed the role as the Left's chief antagonist, a good look during a primary campaign aimed at drawing the most devout Republicans. He asked courts to expel the lawmakers who walked out, brought lawsuits to declare their seats vacant and sought to jail O\u2019Rourke, arguably the state\u2019s most well-known Democrat, accusing him of illegally raising money to help defray costs for the Democratic lawmakers who left.",

      "Republicans affiliated with the Senate majority in Washington, including the Senate Leadership Fund, have argued that if Paxton wins the Republican Senate primary, it would cost the party at least $100 million more to win the open seat in Texas.

      "Talarico's social media following has expanded to more than 1 million on Instagram and TikTok. He has said he is considering a Senate run but hasn't decided yet. O\u2019Rourke had high praise for Talarico but said the young lawmaker\u2019s plans wouldn\u2019t affect his decision.",

      "Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House\u2019s demands",
      "WASHINGTON -- Now that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled that the central bank could soon cut its key interest rate, he faces a new challenge: how to do it without seeming to cave to the White House's demands.",
      "For months, Powell has largely ignored President Donald Trump's constant hectoring that he reduce borrowing costs. Yet on Friday, in a highly-anticipated speech, Powell suggested that the Fed could take such a step as soon as its next meeting in September.",
      "It will be a fraught decision for the Fed, which must weigh it against persistent inflation and an economy that could also improve in the second half of this year. Both trends, if they occur, could make a cut look premature.",
      "Trump has urged Powell to slash rates, arguing there is \u201cno inflation\u201d and saying that a cut would lower the government\u2019s interest payments on its $37 trillion in debt.",
      "Powell, on the other hand, has suggested that a rate cut is likely for reasons quite different than Trump's: He is worried that the economy is weakening. His remarks on Friday at an economic symposium in Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming also indicated that the Fed will move carefully and cut rates at a much slower pace than Trump wants.",
      "Powell pointed to economic growth that \u201chas slowed notably in the first half of this year,\u201d to an annual rate of 1.2%, down from 2.5% last year. There has also been a \u201cmarked slowing\u201d in the demand for workers, he added, which threatens to raise unemployment.",
      "Still, Powell said that tariffs have started to lift the price of goods and could continue to push inflation higher, a possibility Fed officials will closely monitor and that will make them cautious about additional rate cuts.",
      "The Fed\u2019s key short-term interest rate, which influences other borrowing costs for things like mortgages and auto loans, is currently 4.3%. Trump has called for it to be cut as low as 1% \u2014 a level no Fed official supports.",
      "However the Fed moves forward, it will likely do so while continuing to assert its longstanding independence. A politically independent central bank is considered by most economists as critical to preventing inflation, because it can take steps \u2014 such as raising interest rates to cool the economy and combat inflation \u2014 that are harder for elected officials to do.",
      "There are 19 members of the Fed\u2019s interest-rate setting committee, 12 of whom vote on rate decisions. One of them, Beth Hammack, president of the Federal Reserve\u2019s Cleveland branch, said Friday in an interview with The Associated Press that she is committed to the Fed\u2019s independence.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m laser focused ... on ensuring that I can deliver good outcomes for the for the public, and I try to tune out all the other noise,\u201d she said.",
      "She remains concerned that the Fed still needs to fight stubborn inflation, a view shared by several colleagues.",
      "\u201cInflation is too high and it\u2019s been trending in the wrong direction,\u201d Hammack said. \u201cRight now I see us moving away from our goals on the inflation side.\u201d",

      "Powell himself did not discuss the Fed's independence during his speech in Wyoming, where he received a standing ovation by the assembled academics, economists, and central bank officials from around the world. But Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, said that was likely a deliberate choice and intended, ironically, to demonstrate the Fed's independence.",
      "\u201cThe not talking about independence was a way of trying as best they could to signal we\u2019re getting on with the business,\u201d Posen said. \"We\u2019re still having a civilized internal discussion about the merits of the issue. And even if it pleases the president, we\u2019re going to make the right call.\u201d",
      "It was against that backdrop that Trump intensified his own pressure campaign against another top Fed official.",
      "Trump said he would fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook if she did not step down from her position. Bill Pulte, a Trump appointee to head the agency that regulates mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, alleged Wednesday that Cook committed mortgage fraud when she bought two properties in 2021. She has not been charged.",
      "Cook has said she would not be \u201cbullied\u201d into giving up her position. She declined Friday to comment on Trump's threat.",
      "If Cook is somehow removed, that would give Trump an opportunity to put a loyalist on the Fed\u2019s governing board. Members of the board vote on all interest rate decisions. He has already nominated a top White House economist, Stephen Miran, to replace former governor Adriana Kugler, who stepped down Aug. 1.",
      "Trump had previously threatened to fire Powell, but hasn\u2019t done so. Trump appointed Powell in late 2017. His term as chair ends in about nine months.",
      "Powell is no stranger to Trump's attacks. Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that the president also went after him in 2018 for raising interest rates, but that didn't stop Powell.",
      "\u201cThe president has a long history of applying pressure to Chairman Powell,\u201d Strain said. \u201cAnd Chairman Powell has a long history of resisting that pressure. So it would be odd, I think, if on his way out the door, he caved for the first time.\u201d",
      "Still, Strain thinks that Powell is overestimating the risk that the economy will weaken further and push unemployment higher. If inflation worsens while hiring continues, that could force the Fed to potentially reverse course and increase rates again next year.",
      "\u201cThat would do further damage to the Fed's credibility around maintaining low and stable price inflation,\u201d he said.",

      "NEW ORLEANS -- Twenty years ago, Hurricane Katrina changed the face of education in New Orleans forever. The school system was utterly destroyed and then utterly transformed, becoming the first and only all-charter school district in the country.",
      "Ahead of the storm's anniversary, The Associated Press asked three survivors to reflect on what it was like to be a student or a teacher during that tumultuous period.",
      "For some, connections they developed with educators who helped them through the crisis inspired careers as teachers. Their experiences also offer lessons for teachers and schools going through natural disasters today.",
      "What follows are the educators\u2019 accounts in their own words, condensed for publication.",
      "1. Chris Dier, a history teacher at Benjamin Franklin High School in New Orleans, was just starting his senior year of high school in neighboring Chalmette when Katrina hit. He evacuated to a hotel, then a shelter for Katrina survivors in Texas.",
      "1. Chris Dier, a history teacher at Benjamin Franklin High School in New Orleans, was just starting his senior year of high school in neighboring Chalmette when Katrina hit. He evacuated to a hotel, then a shelter for Katrina survivors in Texas.",
      "I remember waking up to my Aunt Tina banging on the hotel door. I remember she said, \u2018There are hundreds of bodies everywhere,\u2019 that the levees broke. I\u2019ll never forget getting that knock on the door that let me know that everything has changed, that everything is different.",
      "There was an elderly couple that came to the shelter and talked with us, and they offered us their trailer so we could actually have a space to live. We stayed in that trailer for the remainder of the year, and I finished my high school in Texas, Henderson High School.",
      "One of the reasons I wanted to become a teacher was because of how these teachers treated us at our lowest points. I remember Coach Propes, the soccer coach who got us soccer cleats and took care of us in that way. I remember Mrs. Rains, the English teacher who had us in our class and had all the supplies ready. I remember Ms. Pellon, the Spanish teacher who also had supplies for us. Mr. McGinnis, he would come in in the early hours to tutor me in chemistry because I missed weeks of school.",
      "They made me feel welcome. They made me feel like I belong. They made me feel that I was part of a larger community, as opposed to just a statistic.",
      "The last thing I wanted to do growing up was be a teacher, because I saw how my mom was a teacher and all the time and effort she put into her craft. She would be cooking with her left hand and grading papers with her right hand. I wanted more in life. But Katrina changed me in that way, because I saw how these teachers responded.",
      "Everything we talk about is \u2018before Katrina\u2019 and \u2018after Katrina.\u2019 Now I have \u2018before COVID\u2019 and \u2018after COVID.\u2019 I started seeing the parallels right away, right when the schools closed down, March 16 (in 2020). The questions that (students) had, those same questions I had after we evacuated during Hurricane Katrina. I remember thinking, \u2018Are we really never coming back to school?\u2019",
      "I went home that weekend and wrote an open letter to seniors, offering some support and advice. I wrote about what it\u2019s like to lose your senior year. I said that folks will downplay the situation, because they don\u2019t know what it feels like to have their senior year stripped. But I do know. I try to tell them that they\u2019re not forgotten: Teachers are thinking of them. We care for them.",

      "We decided after watching the news on Friday, to leave Saturday. I just remember being on the highway forever. Literally forever. I lived with my brother and my sister-in-law during that time, because my mother had passed away when I was 12, in 2003. We were heading to Alexandria, where my sister-in-law is from. I just remember being hungry for a long time.",
      "It was devastating to see what all was taking place in New Orleans on national TV during this time. When you saw the large amount of people, the impact of the water and the flooding and the damage that was done because of the wind, it was like: Oh, we\u2019re going to be in Alexandria a while.",

      "We moved to Plano, Texas, for about six months. Really nice area, really nice people. There were more white people than I\u2019ve ever seen before at school. I felt the racism a little bit more. It was more prevalent from students.",
      "I was not performing academically at the level that I had normally been in New Orleans. Just trying to stay afloat in my classes was a struggle. The teachers didn\u2019t really go out of their way. They were strictly, like, \u2018This is the lesson, this is the material, this is when the test is.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t get the love and attention that I was accustomed to in New Orleans.",
      "I came back to New Orleans in March or April. It felt good to be back home. I had my friend base from middle school. I had friends from elementary school. I was back amongst family and elders, like my grandma, my auntie, my cousins, everybody. We lived 10, 15 minutes within each other, which is really good. We had neighborhood-based schooling, you know, prior to Katrina.",
      "It changed the trajectory of my life. I did not want to always become an educator. With my mother passing away, it was school that grounded me. It was the teachers and leaders inside of those school buildings that supported me, pushed me and encouraged me.",
      "I had some pivotal educators in my life who played a big role in my education and my journey. In return, I felt like I could do that for other children of New Orleans.

      "His death was confirmed by the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute.",
      "Born in 1936 in Shreveport, Louisiana, Dobson started a radio show counseling Christians on how to be good parents and in 1977 founded Focus on the Family. At its peak, the organization had more than 1,000 employees and gave Dobson a platform to weigh in on legislation and serve as an adviser to five presidents.",
      "He became a force in the 1980s for pushing conservative Christian ideals in American politics alongside fundamentalist giants like Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. He campaigned for bringing religious conservatives into the political mainstream, and in 1989, Falwell called Dobson a rising star. Decades later, he served on a board of evangelical leaders that advised President Donald Trump in 2016. He supported Trump in all three of his presidential campaigns.",

      "Gary Bauer, a senior vice president at Dobson\u2019s institute, called him a \u201cpioneer\u201d who helped families in a world of shifting values. Dobson interviewed President Ronald Reagan in the Oval Office in 1985, thanking him for concentrating on issues important to families.",
      "Dobson's radio program promoted guests who said they abandoned their homosexuality and instead embraced Christianity.",
      "Dobson was not just an influential voice that helped lead the rise of the Christian, conservative movement to today, where such a large portion of Republican voters consider themselves evangelical conservatives. He was also mentor to today\u2019s leading Christian conservative voices.",

      "Federal safety investigators and some members of Congress want to expand special safety rules that apply to trains carrying flammable material to many more trains, saying the risk to many U.S. communities is far greater than currently known",
      "When a BNSF freight train carrying six cars of liquefied petroleum gas derailed near Manuelito, New Mexico, in 2024, the resulting fire shut down more than 100 miles of an interstate highway.",
      "The train carried enough flammable material to send a column of fire and black smoke high into the thin, dry air \u2014 but not enough to qualify as a \u201chigh-hazard flammable train\u201d under federal rules.",
      "That meant the train was not obligated to follow federal safety rules that require high-hazard flammable trains, or HHFTs, to operate at slower speeds, and use safer braking systems and tank cars.",
      "It also meant BNSF was not obligated to include the train in federally-mandated reports to New Mexico emergency management officials estimating the movement of HHFTs through the state.",
      "Federal safety investigators and some lawmakers want to change that. For more than a decade, the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates major train accidents, has tried and failed to convince federal regulators to make HHFT safety rules apply to a much larger number of trains. In an investigation report on the Manuelito disaster released in June, the NTSB again called for changes.",
      "The current definition of an HHFT only covers trains carrying large quantities of flammable liquids, such as crude oil or alcohol. The safety board wants to expand the definition to include liquefied petroleum gas and other flammable gases.",
      "The issue generated intense interest from lawmakers following the catastrophic derailment of a Norfolk Southern train that caught fire, resulting in the release of a toxic plume of vinyl chloride \u2014 a flammable gas \u2014 over East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. The train wasn\u2019t classified as an HHFT, even though it was carrying three loaded tank cars of flammable liquid. That\u2019s because the federal definition requires a train to carry at least 35 loaded cars of flammable liquid \u2014 or at least 20 cars in a row \u2013 to qualify.",
      "In the wake of that accident, some members of Congress filed legislation that overlaps with the NTSB recommendation and goes one step further. The DERAIL Act, introduced by Rep. Chris Deluzio, D-Pa., would define an HHFT as one carrying even a single car of a flammable gas or a flammable liquid.",
      "\u201cI think what we saw in the East Palestine derailment is a pretty blunt reality that even just a single train carrying something flammable and toxic \u2014 say, like vinyl chloride \u2014 can cause a lot of harm to people who live near the tracks,\u201d said Deluzio, whose Pennsylvania district sits just across the border from East Palestine.",
      "The bill stalled in the House after being introduced in 2023, but Deluzio reintroduced it in January. Supporters say the legislation, which has not moved in Congress, could provide U.S. communities with a more accurate picture of risk from train derailments.",
      "That\u2019s because there are many more trains carrying small amounts of flammable material than there are trains carrying large amounts, according to a Howard Center for Investigative Journalism analysis of data that details the precise movement of freight trains.",
      "Federal transportation officials have recognized rail as the \u201csafest land-based method of moving large quantities of chemicals over long distances\u201d when compared with movement on trucks.",
      "The Association of American Railroads \u2014 an industry lobbyist and trade group with significant sway over rail safety practices \u2014 \u201chas concerns with a number of the provisions in (the DERAIL Act) and similar bills,\u201d spokesperson Jessica Kahanek said. The industry follows its own protocol that limits the speed of trains carrying more than 20 cars of hazardous material, she noted.",
      "The association is open to discussing the HHFT definition, but changes \u201cmust be driven by an assessment of actual risk,\u201d Kahanek said, and must allow railroads \u201cto continue safely delivering the goods Americans depend on each day.\u201d",
      "Railroads closely protect real-time and location-specific information about the movement of freight trains carrying hazardous materials, saying public disclosure presents a public safety risk.",
      "To analyze the potential impact of the proposed change to the definition of HHFTs, the Howard Center relied on data from RailState LLC, a company that independently captures detailed information on train movements.",
      "The company has placed optical sensors on private land at key locations across the North American rail network. The sensors take pictures of each passing train. They use artificial intelligence to extract information about the cargo, identifying hazardous materials by reading warning placards displayed on rail cars.",
      "The firm sells its information to government agencies in the U.S. and Canada, as well as to shippers and other clients.",
      "Only the railroads \u2014 and not the U.S. government \u2014 know the precise number and real-time location of HHFTs. It\u2019s not possible, even with RailState\u2019s data, to precisely compare the number of trains that meet the current definition to the number of HHFTs that would meet the proposed definition.",
      "One major reason: both definitions only consider loaded tank cars, and RailState\u2019s data cannot automatically determine whether a tank car is loaded \u2014 or only contains chemical residue.",
      "What is clear from the RailState data, however, is that there are many more trains with a smaller number of cars with hazmat placards indicating the presence of a flammable gas or a flammable/combustible liquid than there are trains carrying a large number of cars with placards for a flammable/combustible liquid.",

      "NEW YORK -- A ban on assault weapons that Connecticut put in place after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting is constitutional, a federal appeals court said Friday, as it rejected challenges by gun rights advocates who claim it violates the Second Amendment.",
      "The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said groups challenging a 2013 law banning assault weapons and a second gun control law enacted a decade later could not show that the guns they are still able to possess, including several semi-automatic handguns, are not sufficient for self-defense purposes.",
      "The 2nd Circuit also said public interest favors allowing the ban.",

It upheld a Connecticut judge's ruling that plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a sufficient likelihood that they would win their challenge to block enforcement of the laws while the lawsuits proceed.",

      "Since taking office in February, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi has authorized prosecutors to seek the death penalty against 19 people, including nine defendants in cases in which President Joe Biden's administration had sought lesser sentences. But judges have blocked those reversal attempts for all but two defendants, most recently on Monday in a pair of cases in the U.S. Virgin Islands, showing the limits of the Trump administration's power to undo decisions in cases already well underway.",

      "\u201cThe government has proceeded hastily in this case, and in doing so has leapfrogged important constitutional and statutory rights,\" Trump appointee U.S. Judge Stephanie Gallagher in Maryland wrote in June, striking the notice of intent to seek the death penalty against three alleged MS-13 gang members accused of killing two teenage girls in 2020. \u201cThat is unacceptable.\u201d",
      "Authorization of capital prosecution typically occurs years before trial, but in the Maryland case, prosecutors filed the death penalty notice less than four months before the trial was scheduled to start. None of the defendants were represented by attorneys who specialize in death penalty litigation, which they would have been entitled to under federal law due to the complexity of capital cases and the potential consequences.",
      "\u201cThe government does not hide the ball here \u2014 the only reason for its flip-flop on the death penalty was the change in administration,\u201d wrote Gallagher, who called the government\u2019s \u201cwillful blindness\u201d to the differences between capital and non-capital trials \u201cstartling.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis court will not cast aside decades of law, professional standards, and norms to accommodate the government\u2019s pursuit of its agenda,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOf course, elections have consequences, and this administration is entitled to pursue the death penalty in cases where it can do so in accordance with constitutional and statutory requirements. But this is not one of them.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors in Maryland and in a Nevada case declined to comment, but in court documents they argued that the Justice Department has an \u201cinherent power\u201d to reconsider previous decisions and that the timing of the death notice was \u201cobjectively reasonable\u201d given that the defendants had years to prepare for trial.",
      "\u201cThe Attorney General has simply reconsidered an earlier decision, which it is her prerogative to do so, and exercising that inherent authority is not misconduct but basic management and governance,\u201d wrote Maryland\u2019s U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes. \u201cAt no point did the Government make an enforceable promise. Deciding not to seek certain charges is not a promise not to do so.\u201d",
      "Trump, whose first administration carried out a record-setting 13 federal executions, signed an order on his first day back in the White House compelling the Justice Department to seek the death penalty in appropriate federal cases and support capital punishment in states. Bondi, who has said she will seek the death penalty \u201cwhenever possible,\u201d quickly lifted a Biden-era moratorium on federal executions and ordered a review of decisions made by the previous administration.",

      "But Robin Maher, executive of the Death Penalty Information Center, said while the Biden administration\u2019s actions reflected declining public support for the death penalty, Trump has brushed that aside.",

      "Whether the reversals will stand remains a question in two of the cases. In the others, courts have sided with defendants who said they reasonably relied on assurances made by the previous administration. In court documents, lawyers for some of the defendants said they would have pursued plea bargains or objected to postponing trial dates had they known the death penalty decision would be reversed.",
      "\u201cIn some of these cases, very different paths were taken when those assurances were given,\u201d Maher said.",
      "In Nevada, prosecutors notified Cory Spurlock of their intention to seek the death penalty just 12 days before he was set to go on trial for the 2021 deaths of a California couple. Striking down that notice in May, Judge Miranda Du said the government fell far short of justifying its \u201cwholesale reversal at the eleventh hour.\u201d The trial began this week after prosecutors withdrew their appeal of her ruling.",
      "\u201cThe government decided \u2014 certainly not by inadvertence or accident \u2014 to reverse course on an issue of critical importance, involving Spurlock\u2019s life, less than two weeks before trial, with full knowledge that the reversal would have a chaotic impact on the progression of this case and would make it impossible to proceed to trial on the scheduled date,\u201d wrote Du, who was nominated by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. \u201cUnder the circumstances, this is certainly tantamount to playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with the Court\u2019s orders in particular and the judicial process in general.\u201d",

And a couple of the buttons popped off. And he goes, 'All right, thanks a lot, Riz. Thanks for coming in. Appreciate that.' I didn't get the role for some reason,\" Ahmed added, jokingly.",

    "story": [
      "A man on trial for organizing the ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph\u00a0at a Memphis bakery in 2021 has been found not guilty.",
      "A Memphis jury deliberated about three hours before finding Hernandez Govan, 45, not guilty of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first-degree murder. He rejected an offer from the state last month to settle with a guilty plea, CBS News affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "On Thursday, Govan hugged his lawyer and thanked Shelby County Judge Jennifer Mitchell after she told him he was free to go.",
      "Govan was not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claimed he directed the two people who did. The jury was not convinced, however, despite a man's testimony that Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut.",
      "Govan's lawyer questioned the quality of the police investigation and the validity of cellphone communications between Govan and the men who shot Dolph, arguing that nothing in the communications directly incriminated Govan or tied him to the killings.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works.",
      "On the day of the 2021 ambush, the 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "Authorities said two men exited a white Mercedes-Benz and began shooting at the rapper at the bakery. He died after being shot about 20 times, according to a medical examiner's report.",
      "Four years earlier, Young Dolph suffered critical injuries\u00a0in a 2017 attack, when three men approached and shot him over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. Earlier that same year, he had been involved in a separate shooting where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",
      "Testifying against Govan was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the two shooters who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter.",
      "Smith faces charges for murder and conspiracy to commit murder for his alleged role in Young Dolph's death. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges and does not currently have a trial date set. Johnson was originally sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole following his 2024 conviction, plus an additional 35 years for two additional convictions from his trial.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed Young Dolph's killing as part of an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, rapper Yo Gotti. Smith has testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "At Johnson's earlier trial, a prosecutor told jurors Cocaine Muzik Group (now known as Collective Music Group), a rival record label founded by Yo Gotti, wanted Young Dolph to work for them, but he turned them down.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant in January 2024.",
      "Smith testified Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits,\" including giving Smith guns for the killing, and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the Thanksgiving turkey giveaway, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Prosecutors introduced as evidence dozens of cellphone communications between Johnson, Smith, Govan and Big Jook ahead of the shooting.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said on Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Govan did not testify in his defense.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date.",

    "summary": "Hernandez Govan is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the two people who did.",
    "story": [
      "The trial of a man charged with organizing the daytime ambush killing of rapper Young Dolph at a Memphis bakery in November 2021 began on Monday.",
      "Hernandez Govan, 45, faces charges of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and attempted murder. He is not accused of shooting Young Dolph, but prosecutors claim he directed the\u00a0two people\u00a0who did. He rejected the state's offer to settle with a guilty plea last month,\u00a0CBS affiliate WREG\u00a0reported.",
      "Young Dolph, whose legal name is Adolph Thornton Jr., was a rapper, independent label owner and producer who grew up in Memphis and was admired in the city for his charitable works. The 36-year-old was in his hometown to hand out Thanksgiving turkeys to families when his visit to his favorite cookie shop turned into an attack that shocked the entertainment world.",
      "City officials and community activists pointed to the killing as a symbol of the dangers of gun violence in Memphis, where more than 300 homicides were reported that year.",
      "Memphis prosecutors have portrayed the killing as part an effort by Anthony \"Big Jook\" Mims to get revenge on Young Dolph for diss tracks aimed at Big Jook and the record label he helped run for his brother, Yo Gotti.",
      "Big Jook was shot and killed outside a restaurant earlier this year.",
      "Testifying against Govan on Monday was Cornelius Smith Jr., who has admitted to being one of the\u00a0two shooters\u00a0who ambushed Young Dolph. Smith previously was the main witness against\u00a0Justin Johnson, who was convicted of first-degree murder in 2024 after Smith named him as the second shooter. Smith had previously testified that Big Jook put out a $100,000 hit on Young Dolph, as well as smaller bounties on all the artists at Young Dolph's record label, Paper Route Empire.",
      "Smith is charged with murder and conspiracy to commit murder but has pleaded not guilty and does not yet have a trial date. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole in September 2024.\u00a0He was later sentenced\u00a0for two other convictions from the trial: conspiracy to commit murder and being a felon in possession of a gun.",
      "Smith testified on Monday that \"I didn't know anything about Paper Route having no hits,\" before Govan told him about them. He said Govan hired him to \"do the hits\" and was going to take $10,000 as his cut. Govan was also the person who told him and Johnson that Young Dolph would be in Memphis for the volunteer event, so \"that's our opportunity,\" Smith said.",
      "Meanwhile, Govan's defense attorney, Manny Arora, tried to paint Smith as an unreliable witness who would say anything to try to get a lighter sentence.",
      "Arora pointed to previous testimony where Smith recalled a chance encounter with Big Jook. At the time, Smith implied that Big Jook was the person who hired him. After Smith was arrested, his attorney called Big Jook's attorney and received somewhere between $38,000 and $50,000 in cash. Smith said Monday that he did not know who had supplied the money.",
      "Smith also testified that he previously heard that Govan might be working with the FBI. Arora asked why Smith would take a job from Govan if that were the case. Smith said that Govan was \"innocent until proven guilty.\"",
      "Young Dolph began his career by releasing numerous mixtapes. His studio albums include his 2016 debut, \"King of Memphis.\" He also collaborated on other mixtapes and albums with fellow rappers Key Glock, Megan Thee Stallion, T.I., Gucci Mane, 2 Chainz and others. Young Dolph had three albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, with 2020\u2032s \"Rich Slave\" peaking at No. 4.",
      "He was among the musical stars that The Grammy Awards paid tribute to during its memoriam segment at the 2022 awards.",
      "In a\u00a02024 interview with The Associated Press, Carlisa Brown, Young Dolph's sister, called her brother's killing a \"very senseless murder\" and added that his family wants everyone involved to get the justice they deserve.",
      "The attack that killed the rapper wasn't the first time he was targeted. In 2017, Young Dolph was approached by three men and shot over \"beef,\" according to the Los Angeles Police Department. He was critically injured but survived. Earlier that same year, he was involved in another shooting, where at least 100 bullets were fired at his SUV.",

      "The magnetic British actor Terence Stamp (July 22, 1938-Aug. 17, 2025) earned a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for his first film appearance, in 1962's \"Billy Budd.\" But he was best known for playing the supervillain General Zod in \"Superman\" and \"Superman II.\" His other major film roles included a kidnapper in \"The Collector,\" a London criminal in \"The Limey,\" and a trans woman accompanying two drag queens in a romp across the Australian Outback in the comedy \"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.\"",
      "Born in London, Stamp worked in advertising before pursuing an acting career. Early on, he shared an apartment with fellow up-and-coming actor Michael Caine (they also shared the same suit for auditions). After making his screen debut as the title character in \"Billy Budd,\" Stamp appeared with Laurence Olivier in \"Term of Trial,\" Monica Vitti in \"Modesty Blaise,\" and Julie Christie in \"Far From the Madding Crowd.\" He appeared in several European films (\"Teorema,\" \"Hu-Man,\" \"The Divine Nymph\"), but he spent much of the '70s on a spiritual quest in India after years of unemployment, believing he has aged out of his early, youthful roles which had played off his dashing good looks.",
      "At a 2013 British Film Institute screening, Stamp said he was living in an ashram when he got a telegram offering him the part of Zod opposite Marlon Brando. \"And I thought, my life is about to change,\" he said.",
      "His performance as the ruthless exile from Krypton who wields the same superpowers as Superman was indelible, as was his desire to dominate the Earth. Stamp claimed \"Superman\" was the only successful film he'd ever been in, but it left its mark: \"I can rarely get through the day without somebody coming up to me and saying, 'Kneel before Zod!'\" he said.",
      "His film and TV credits included \"Meetings With Remarkable Men,\" \"The Hit,\" \"Legal Eagles,\" \"The Company of Wolves,\" \"Wall Street,\" \"Young Guns,\" \"Star Wars: Episode I \u2013 The Phantom Menace,\" \"Bowfinger,\" \"His Dark Materials,\" \"Unfinished Song,\" \"Wanted,\" \"The Adjustment Bureau,\" \"A Song for Marion,\" \"Bitter Harvest,\" and \"Last Night in Soho.\" He spent much of his later career playing darker, villainous (but still charismatic) characters.",
      "He published several memoirs, including \"Stamp Album,\" \"Coming Attractions,\" \"Double Feature,\" and \"The Ocean Fell into the Drop.\"",
      "In 1987,\u00a0Stamp told BBC Radio's \"Desert Island Discs\": \"I have a lot of things in my head. Obviously I'm kind of, there's a lot of time when I'm fueled by kind of high-up pain. As an actor, I get a chance to express all the different things that come up out of it. And so, it's a kind of release, it's like a safety valve. The big energy can be channeled into something productive. I think if I didn't have that outlet, then I would be somebody who vacillated from terrific ups to terrific downs, and I consider that psychotic.\" He added, \"I'm lucky because I can do something with all these things that occur to me, I can channel them.\""

    "summary": "Cracker Barrel stock plunged as much as 15% after the restaurant chain released a new logo that removes its long-time image of a man leaning against a barrel.",
    "story": [
      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million for year, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",

      "The struggling Silicon Valley chipmaker has a market cap of just over $100 billion. The agreement comes just after Japanese technology giant SoftBank Group disclosed Monday that it is accumulating its 2% stake in Intel.",
      "The Trump administration has been in talks to secure a 10% stake in Intel in exchange for converting government grants that were pledged to Intel under former President Joe Biden. With a 10% stake, the U.S. government would become one of Intel's largest shareholders and blur the traditional lines separating the public sector and private sector in a country that remains the world's largest economy.",
      "Intel confirmed the deal in a news release Friday evening which stated that the U.S. government would \"make an $8.9 billion investment in Intel common stock, reflecting the confidence the Administration has in Intel to advance key national priorities and the critically important role the company plays in expanding the domestic semiconductor industry.\"",
      "Intel said the government's equity stake would be \"funded by the remaining $5.7 billion in grants previously awarded, but not yet paid, to Intel under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act and $3.2 billion awarded to the company as part of the Secure Enclave program.\"",
      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",
      "What federal grants does Intel receive?",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn't been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "On Friday, the president took it a step further: \"I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,\" he said.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday highlighted twin economic risks of a slowing labor market and rising inflation, but opened the door to rate cuts in a widely anticipated speech at the annual Jackson Hole, Wyoming economic forum.",
      "\"Risks to inflation are tilted to the upside, and risks to employment are to the downside \u2014 a challenging situation,\" Powell said in his speech.",
      "The Fed will \"proceed carefully\" but the shifting balance of risks \"may warrant adjusting our policy stance,\" Powell said.",
      "Powell's remarks signal the Federal Reserve is likely to cut rates at its Sept. 17 meeting, which would mark the first reduction since December 2024, several economists said in research notes following the speech. Wall Street cheered Powell's remarks, with the S&P 500 jumping 1.3% in late morning trading.",
      "\"That's about as clear cut as Powell can get that he has shifted his view since July and is leaning toward a cut in September,\" said Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, in an email. \"He justifies this change in view by acknowledging the downside risks to employment after the shocking July jobs report.\"",
      "While Powell highlighted the slowdown in the labor market, he also maintained that inflation risks from Mr. Trump's tariffs remain. The Fed has been closely watching the nation's inflation rate, which remains stubbornly above the central bank's 2% annual target and which has inched higher in recent months.",
      "Under the Fed's mandate, the central bank is tasked with keeping both inflation and unemployment low.",
      "Powell said the tariffs could result in a \"one-time shift in the price level,\" resulting in a short-term boost to inflation.",
      "\"Of course, 'one-time' does not mean 'all at once',\" he added. \"It will continue to take time for tariff increases to work their way through supply chains and distribution networks. Moreover, tariff rates continue to evolve, potentially prolonging the adjustment process.\"",
      "Powell's comments come as he faces a range of pressures, including President Trump's repeated calls for his resignation and conflicting economic signals that could make it tougher for the Fed to fulfill its dual mandate of promoting full employment while keeping inflation in check.",
      "When monetary policy makers opted to hold rates steady last month, Powell at that time highlighted the growing economic uncertainty stemming from Mr. Trump's tariffs, while adding that he believed the economy remained on solid ground.",
      "Yet subsequent economic data has pointed to a slowdown. Job growth \u2014 a key measure of the economy's strength \u2014 significantly undershot economists' forecasts, while a large downward revision in May and June payroll gains suggested the labor market was shakier than previously thought.",

      "Powell, whose term as Fed chair ends in May of 2026, could be making his last major speech as the central bank's leader at the event, which is hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. The symposium is closely watched by investors and economists because it provides a stage for Fed officials to share their views on the economy and the direction of monetary policy.",
      "A focal point in Jackson Hole will be if Powell offers any hints about the Fed's next interest-rate decision, scheduled for Sept. 17. Mr. Trump has badgered the Fed to cut rates, pointing to solid U.S. economic data and muted inflation. Powell has mostly shrugged off that pressure, emphasizing that the central bank is taking a \"wait and see\" approach as it monitors the potential impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices.",
      "Yet Powell also faces a complicated economic picture, with recent signals pointing to a slowdown in job growth and one gauge of inflation registering its largest increase in three years.",
      "\"You have this political pressure balanced off against the economic pressure, which makes Powell's job particularly difficult, and it's driving a hyper-focus on what he might say on Friday,\" Melissa Brown, managing director of investment decision research at SimCorp, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The Federal Reserve declined to comment ahead of Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole symposium, whose theme this year is \"Labor Markets in Transition: Demographics, Productivity, and Macroeconomic Policy.\"",
      "The Kansas City Fed will broadcast Powell's speech on its YouTube\u00a0channel\u00a0on Friday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time.",
      "To cut or not to cut?",
      "While Powell is likely to discuss economic trends in Jackson Hole, he is virtually certain to demur on the question of when the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the central bank's 12-person interest rate-setting panel, might choose to lower its benchmark rate.",
      "That is by design. Fed officials famously keep monetary policy decisions \u2014 which are set deliberatively and by consensus \u2014 private before they are officially announced to avoid roiling financial markets and to insulate the central bank from political pressure.",
      "Meanwhile, policy makers will have a chance to assess several major pieces of economic data before their Sept. 16-17 meeting, including the Labor Department's monthly jobs report on Sept. 5 and the Consumer Price Index on Sept. 11.",
      "The head of the labor statistics bureau\u00a0was fired in August after the agency's latest employment figures showed a sharp slowdown in job-creation, prompting Mr. Trump to question the accuracy of the data. For now, the August payrolls and CPI reports remain on the Labor Department's calendar of scheduled releases.",
      "\"I don't think Powell can push the narrative toward cutting because that leaves him no option but to cut,\" said Mike Sanders, head of fixed income at investment management firm Madison Investments.",
      "\"He has to signal, 'We're still data-dependent and we'll see what the data tells us'\" so the Fed doesn't get pushed into a corner, Sanders added.",
      "For their part, investors are clearly placing their bets on the Fed lowering rates in September for the first time since December 2024. Wall Street economists put the likelihood of a cut at 88%, according to financial data company FactSet, with most expecting a 0.25 percentage-point dip.",
      "\"The last time we heard from the chair at the July FOMC meeting, Powell struck a notably hawkish tone, arguing that the labor market was 'solid' and that inflation was still too high, even excluding tariff effects,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a research note this week. \"We expect a somewhat different tone from Powell this week, particularly with respect to the labor market.\"",
      "At last year's Jackson Hole event, Powell signaled that interest-rate cuts were coming after the central bank had previously raised its benchmark rate to its highest level in 23 years in trying to extinguish inflation. The following month, the Fed announced a jumbo cut\u00a0of 0.50 percentage points in a move to boost economic growth.",
      "Dueling mandates",
      "This year, Powell could similarly use his platform in Wyoming to indicate his openness to a rate cut, according to Will Denyer, chief U.S. economist at Gavekal Research. At the same time, the Fed is also \"in a pickle,\" given troubling jobs data and signs that inflation could be creeping higher, he said in a report this week.",
      "That speaks to the Fed's so-called dual mandate, which is to both maximize employment and minimize inflation. Balancing those two goals can require different \u2014 and sometimes conflicting \u2014 policies, as lowering interest rates can boost job growth while causing inflation to tick higher, and vice versa.",
      "\"Data alone suggests a rising risk of a stagflationary scenario, which is, you know, a Fed nightmare,\" Denyer said. \"That puts them in a bind between their two mandates being in conflict.\"",
      "Minutes for the Fed's July 30 rate decision meeting, when the FOMC again chose to hold rates steady, show that some members \"remained worried that supply-chain disruptions could cause inflation to remain stubbornly elevated,\" signaling that price increases remain top of mind, noted Oxford Economics chief U.S. economist Ryan Sweet in a report on Wednesday.",

    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 16:14:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Energy suppliers are having trouble keeping up with the rapid increase in demand, and consumers in some states are seeing higher monthly bills.",
    "story": [
      "A July 11 post in a Hoboken, New Jersey, parenting group on Facebook pointed to a frustrating trend: \"Our utility bill is more than double what it was last month. ... Anything we can do about it?\" The post had several dozen replies and most of the commenters said their home utility bills had also risen dramatically.",
      "On the campaign trail a year ago, President Trump vowed, \"Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months \u2014 at a maximum, 18 months,\" but this year has seen energy prices rising in several states. Residents and governors in five East Coast states are blaming electric supplier, PJM Interconnection. The company is the largest grid operator in the U.S., serving 13 states and 65 million customers.",
      "In New Jersey, energy prices increased on June 1, causing a 17-20% jump in residential customers'utility bills. The utility company PSE&G told its New Jersey customers they should expect to see a higher monthly bill of about $183 for the average customer, an increase of $27.",
      "PSE&G attributed the price hike to \"an increase in energy demand combined with the need for new power generation,\" which it said \"has driven higher supply prices.\" As a utility, PSE&G pointed out that it doesn't earn a profit on the electric supply, so \"these costs are passed through directly to customers.\"",
      "PJM says it is experiencing a rapid increase in energy demand, driven by the power requirements of artificial intelligence, data centers, electrification and a resurgence in U.S. manufacturing. In its latest forecast, PJM forecast a growth in energy demand of 5% over the next 10 years.",
      "\"We don't have enough newer, more reliable energy sources,\" said Alex Ambrose, a policy analyst at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Ambrose says that renewable sources like wind, solar, and battery are the cheapest and fastest forms of energy to bring online and faults PJM for its reluctance to bring clean energy into the grid: \"PJM is also keeping older coal gas plants running, even if they are uneconomical and more expensive.\"",
      "But in an op-ed in NJ Spotlight News, the company blamed a shortfall of energy on \"state and federal decarbonization policies and some economic pressures\" for closing fossil fuel-based power plants in New Jersey. PJM also said it has a queue of 63 gigawatts of projects \u2014 enough to power more than 47 million homes \u2014 waiting to be connected by 2026, and an \"overwhelming majority\" of those projects are renewables.",
      "Rising utility bills likely an issue in New Jersey governor's race",
      "Energy Secretary Chris Wright is starting to worry that high energy prices could hurt Republicans at the ballot box. In a recent interview with Politico, he blamed Democratic policies for \"pushing prices up right now,\" but conceded the political reality that Republicans may suffer in the next elections.",
      "\"Who's going to get blamed for it? We're going to get blamed because we're in office,\" he said.",
      "New Jersey is poised to be among the first to test the issue in the governor's race this November.",
      "\"Affordability is the number one issue in this race, and rising energy prices are also at the top of everyone's mind,\" Ambrose told CBS News.",
      "Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor, in July released a statement accusing PJM of \"mismanagement\" of the grid: \"PJM has refused to plug clean, cheap power like solar into the grid, while giving preference to coal and oil.\"",
      "And earlier this month, her opponent, Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli, wrote in a post on X about \"Rebecca in Highland Park,\" whose electric bill he said had tripled, \"to more than $1000.\"",
      "\"Why? Because Trenton Democrats, with the approval of my opponent Mikie Sherrill, shut down six electricity generation plants around the state, stopped burning natural gas, and didn't expand our nuclear capabilities in South Jersey,\" Ciattarelli said.",
      "\"We can look at how folks are going to vote in this upcoming election, as a reflection on how they're feeling about the country at large,\" says Ambrose, \"This affordability problem is not going away.\"",
      "A Fairleigh Dickinson University poll earlier this month found that 26% of voters blame the utility companies for price hikes, 19% blame Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, and 10% say that energy producers are at fault. Murphy is not running for reelection due to term limits.",
      "\"Utility bills directly impact elections,\" says Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C.-based energy consultancy firm. Gramlich pointed to the most infamous example of this, the California recall election in 2003, prompted in large part by the state's energy crisis. It cost Democrat Gray Davis the governorship and handed it to Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger.",
      "Gramlich indicated he expects energy prices to remain high for the foreseeable future, predicting that \"two years from now, we're going to see a lot more policy discussion about it.\"",

With Zipotle, small aircrafts called Zips can deliver digital orders directly to customers' homes in just a few minutes, Chipotle said\u00a0in an announcement on Thursday.",
      "Initially, just \"a small number\" of customers will be able to experience Zipotle, according to Chipotle, which said that it would expand the service in the coming weeks.",
      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",
      "For now, each autonomous aircraft can carry orders of up to 5.5 pounds in weight. That will increase eventually to 8 pounds, Chipotle said.",
      "Last year, Chipotle was criticized by some customers who alleged certain restaurants were\u00a0skimping on portions. The company initially denied the claims, before then CEO Brian Niccol\u00a0acknowledged that about 10%\u00a0of Chipotle's 3,500 locations had indeed been underserving customers.",

      "Filed in California federal court, the lawsuit accused Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs of intentionally using complicated cancellation procedures to prevent their customers from ending their gym memberships and other recurring charges. The California-based companies \"have illegally charged hundreds of millions of dollars in unwanted recurring fees\" as a result, the FTC said in its complaint.",
      "Fitness International and Fitness & Sports Clubs run gym chains including L.A. Fitness, Esporta Fitness, City Sports Club and City Studio, according to the FTC, which said they collectively operate more than 600 gym locations and have upwards of 3.7 million members nationwide.",
      "\"The FTC's complaint describes a scenario that too many Americans have experienced \u2013 a gym membership that seems impossible to cancel,\" said Christopher Mufarrige, the director of the Consumer Protection Bureau, in a\u00a0statement\u00a0released by the trade commission. \"Tens of thousands of LA Fitness customers reported difficulties \u2013 cancellation was often restricted to specific times or required speaking to specific managers who were often not present or available.\"",
      "Both companies offer gym memberships for fees as low as $30 per month and as high as $299 per month, and require customers to pay for the first and last month of their memberships upfront before incurring monthly dues and annual fees, the FTC said. In its complaint, the commission detailed \"restrictive\" and confusing cancellation requirements, with an in-person process that's difficult to access being one method, and a mail-in process being another.",
      "\"Each of these cancellation methods is opaque, complicated, and demanding\u2014far from simple,\" the complaint said. \"In particular, Defendants have not adequately disclosed how to cancel when consumers are signing up for their memberships and have presented different, often contradictory, cancellation requirements during sign up, in membership agreements, and on the Defendants' websites.\"",

      "Walmart said\u00a0in May\u00a0that prices had started to increase in late April and got higher in May. But it said Thursday that it had introduced 7,400 price rollbacks, or temporary discounts, across the aisles in the latest quarter.",

      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of artificial intelligence, Google says it has calculated the energy required for its Gemini AI service: Sending a single text prompt consumes as much energy as watching television for nine seconds.",
      "The technology giant on Thursday unveiled a new methodology to measure the environmental impact of its AI models, including energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions.",
      "AI tools have the potential to drive economic growth by boosting productivity and unlocking other efficiencies, economists say. By one estimate from Goldman Sachs, the tech is poised to increase global GDP by 7%, or $7 trillion, over 10 years.",
      "At the same time, scientists are flagging the outsized environmental impact of AI, which is not yet fully understood even as data centers require enormous amounts of electricity.",
      "\"In order to improve the energy efficiency of AI, a clear and comprehensive understanding of AI's environmental footprint is important. To date, comprehensive data on the energy and environmental impact of AI inference has been limited,\" Ben Gomes, Google's senior vice president of learning and sustainability, said in a blog post Thursday.",
      "Aside from their electricity needs, AI data centers also require \"a great deal of water ... \u00a0to cool the hardware used for training, deploying, and fine-tuning generative AI models, which can strain municipal water supplies and disrupt local ecosystems,\" research from MIT\u00a0shows. \"The increasing number of generative AI applications has also spurred demand for high-performance computing hardware, adding indirect environmental impacts from its manufacture and transport.\"",
      "Some new data centers require energy between 100 and 1000 megawatts, roughly equivalent to powering 80,000 to 800,000 homes, according to an April GAO report. For now, however, there are\u00a0no regulations that require corporations to disclose how much energy or water their AI tools consume.",
      "Google said in a technical paper released Thursday by its AI energy and emissions researchers that as adoption of AI tools rises, \"so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental impact of AI serving.\"",
      "What's the environmental impact of Gemini AI?",
      "Google's new paper on the environmental impact of its own AI tools aims to set a standard for measuring the energy and water consumption as well as carbon emissions of various AI models, the company said.",
      "A typical Gemini text query uses 0.24 watt-hours (Wh) of energy, emits 0.03 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent (gCO2e), and consumes 0.26 milliliters \u2014 or about five drops \u2014 of water.",
      "By comparison, the average ChatGPT query uses 0.34 Wh and about one fifteenth of a teaspoon of water, Sam Altman, CEO of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has written.",
      "Google also outlined the progress it has made in reducing the environmental impact of its Gemini platform. Over a recent 12-month period, the energy consumption and carbon footprint of the median Gemini text prompt decreased by factors of 33x and 44x, respectively, it said.",
      "The quality of Gemini's responses also improved over the same time period, the company said.",

      "Nowadays, Labor Day is more commonly associated with barbecues and beach days, but the federal holiday was created to celebrate the hard-won rights of American workers.",
      "Before early labor laws came into play in the 20th century, the average U.S. worker's schedule spanned 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, with low wages and little protections, according to\u00a0History.com.",
      "The culmination of years of strikes and protests by American workers to secure better job conditions, Labor Day was signed into law on June 28, 1894, by President Grover Cleveland.",
      "The civilian workforce in America is around 170 million people strong as of June 2025, data from Statista shows. While there's no cap on the number of hours Americans can work per week, federal law mandates that workers be paid a minimum wage.",
      "That wage has been stuck at $7.25 since 2009. However, many cities and states across the country have passed legislation to enforce higher minimums adjusted for today's cost of living. Most recently in July, the minimum wage was raised in 15 states and cities.",
      "What stores are open and closed on Labor Day?",
      "Big-box retailers including Target, Walgreens and Walmart, will keep their doors open on Sept. 1.",

While Kroger's website says its stores will be operating at regular hours on Sept. 1, Whole Foods recommends you check your local store's webpage on Labor Day for hours of operation.",
      "Fast-food chains, including\u00a0Starbucks and\u00a0Taco Bell, will also be open to serve customers on Sept. 1. While some, like Starbucks, will be operating at regular hours, other chains recommend checking ahead for local store hours, which may be limited on holidays.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes we are.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you for your time this morning.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Thank you so much.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: 'Face the Nation' will be back in a minute. Stay with us."

      "Lt. General Jeffrey Kruse has been ousted as Defense Intelligence Agency director, a senior defense official confirmed Friday.",
      "\"Lt Gen Kruse will no longer serve as DIA Director,\" the official said in a brief statement.",
      "The agency's deputy director, Christine Bordine, will assume the role of acting DIA director, a spokesperson said.",
      "Intelligence committee leaders in Congress were informed about the DIA chief's firing, according to a source familiar with the notification, but were given no reason for it.",
      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, \"The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration's dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country.\"",
      "The DIA was the department responsible for the preliminary assessment of the military strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities. The assessment said that the\u00a0strikes\u00a0had set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, three sources familiar with its contents told CBS news shortly after the airstrikes.",
      "The DIA's findings also indicated some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved before the strikes, according to one of the sources.",
      "That assessment prompted a backlash from the Trump administration, since President Trump had\u00a0said\u00a0in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",
      "DIA employees seem to have been caught completely off guard by Kruse's firing. One DIA employee told CBS News of speaking to another colleague about it who replied with an expletive.",
      "Another said, \"If he is being fired, the workplace at large will lose even more faith in the administration. There's already widespread \u2014 and openly voiced in town halls \u2014 concern of their work being politicized.\"",
      "Two other military officials have been removed from their posts, CBS News confirmed on Friday. Rear Adm. Milton Sands, who served as commander of Navy Special Warfare Command, and Vice Adm. Nancy Lacore, who was the chief of the Navy Reserve, will no longer serve in those roles, according to a Navy official.",
      "Neither Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, nor U.S. Special Operations Commanding Gen. Bryan Fenton, were consulted on the decision to fire Lacore or Sands, sources familiar with the matter told CBS News Saturday.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 17:48:31 -0400",
    "summary": "The Justice Dept. released transcripts of Deputy AG Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
    "story": [
      "The Justice Department on Friday released transcripts of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche's two-day interview with convicted sex trafficker and Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "The transcripts \u2014 which run for over 300 pages \u2014 came after Blanche traveled to Florida last month to meet with Maxwell, following pushback over the Trump administration's handling of the Epstein case's fallout. The release of the transcripts came as the Justice Department also turned over thousands of pages of files in the Epstein case to the House Oversight Committee, which said it would publish, after child sexual abuse material and any information identifying victims is redacted.",
      "The Justice Department also released audio recordings of the Blanche-Maxwell conversation.",
      "The interview came as Maxwell serves a 20-year prison sentence on charges that she helped Epstein recruit and abuse underage victims. She is asking the Supreme Court to review her case, arguing she should be covered by a non-prosecution deal that federal prosecutors cut with Epstein almost two decades ago.",
      "At the outset, Blanche told Maxwell the interview was not part of a \"cooperation deal.\" He said that she had immunity during their conversations, meaning the government wouldn't use anything she said against her, but he made no promises to ask the judge in Maxwell's case for leniency. He did say that the government could prosecute her if she made false statements during the interview.",
      "\"By you meeting with us today, we're really just meeting, I'm not promising to do anything,\" he said.",
      "What do the Maxwell-Blanche transcripts say?",
      "Throughout the interviews, Blanche asked Maxwell about her relationship with Epstein and others in the late financier's orbit. He also asked about some of the allegations made against her and Epstein, who died in federal custody in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.",
      "In some cases, the names of accusers appear to be redacted.",
      "Maxwell said she may have first met President Trump in 1990. She said her father, British publishing magnate Robert Maxwell, was \"friendly with him and liked him very much,\" and he was fond of Mr. Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump.",
      "Later in the interview, Blanche asked about Maxwell and Epstein's relationships with famous people, including Mr. Trump. She said Mr. Trump \"was always very cordial and very kind to me,\" adding that \"I admire his extraordinary achievement in becoming the President now.\" She also said Mr. Trump and Epstein \"seemed friendly,\" but she \"only ever saw them in social settings,\" not private settings.",
      "She said she \"never witnessed the President in any inappropriate setting in any way.\"",
      "She also claimed she \"can't ever recollect\" recruiting somebody from Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club to give Epstein a massage. Late Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre had alleged that Maxwell recruited her while she worked at Mar-a-Lago in the early 2000s. Mr. Trump told reporters last month he cut off ties with Epstein after he \"stole\" employees from Mar-a-Lago, including Giuffre.",
      "She also spoke about former President Bill Clinton, whom she claimed was \"my friend, not Epstein's friend.\" She noted that she attended Chelsea Clinton's wedding with her then-boyfriend, Ted Waitt. She said she did not believe Clinton ever received a massage while the former president was with Epstein. And she told Blanche that Clinton flew on Epstein's private plane, but did not visit Epstein's private island.",
      "Maxwell did not appear to accuse Clinton or Mr. Trump of inappropriate behavior.",
      "Maxwell also appears to address Prince Andrew's relationship with Epstein and a person whose name is redacted. From context, that person appears to be Giuffre, who alleged that Andrew sexually assaulted her as a minor after she traveled to London with Epstein. Andrew had denied the allegations, but settled a lawsuit brought by Giuffre out of court.",
      "When asked about Andrew's relationship with the accuser, she responds, \"what's an even bigger word than bullshit?\" She claimed a famous photo showing Andrew with his arm around Giuffre as Maxwell smiles in the background was \"fake.\" She said \"categorically\" that she \"never, at any time, set Andrew up to have relations with her or any other human being ever.\"",
      "Blanche asked her briefly about several other people whom she claimed to know, including Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Alan Dershowitz and now-Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., with whom she said she went \"dinosaur bone hunting.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News on Saturday through a spokesperson, the Giuffre family, the family said they are \"outraged\" by what they heard, and alleged that: \"The content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction for child sex trafficking.\"",
      "\"During DAG Todd Blanche's bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\" the Giuffre family's statement said. \"This travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\"",
      "The Giuffre family also said that by sending Maxwell to a minimum security prison, the Justice Department sends \"a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded.\"",
      "Maxwell describes her relationship with Epstein",
      "In 1991, Maxwell said she struck up a friendship with Epstein. Maxwell was asked by Blanche in detail about her sexual relationship with Epstein, which she says started in 1992. She told the deputy attorney general that it is a \"misnomer\" that she was with Epstein consistently as a partner, and that she did not know he had other girlfriends until the Epstein flight logs were released.",
      "\"Contemporaneously, I absolutely did not know,\" about other women Epstein was with, Maxwell said, adding that by 1999, their relationship had \"foundered.\"",
      "Maxwell told Blanche that despite their physical relationship ending, she was still being paid by the disgraced financier, and that the two occasionally shared a bed together as \"friends with benefits, if you will, just not sex.\"",
      "Maxwell said at first she was paid $25,000 a year to work for Epstein, starting in 1992, and by the end of the payments in 2009, she was being paid $250,000 per year. Between 2010 and Epstein's 2019 death, Maxwell said her relationship with him was \"almost nonexistent,\" though she acknowledges they exchanged occasional phone calls and emails.",
      "She acknowledged to Blanche that she helped Epstein find people to give him massages at home \u2014 but she said she met them in \"legitimate spas\" and did not believe any of the people she found were under the age of 18. She also claimed it \"never would cross my mind\" that those people were asked to perform sexual favors for Epstein.",
      "At other points, Blanche asked Maxwell about Epstein's career on Wall Street \u2014 a persistent focus of speculation. She noted former Victoria's Secret CEO Lex Wexner was \"one very famous\" financial client of Epstein's, and said former JPMorgan Chase banker Jes Staley was \"business partners\" with Epstein. But she said she was \"not part of Epstein's business world, except tangentially.\"",
      "Maxwell addresses Epstein's case \u2014 and death",
      "Maxwell told Blanche there is \"no list,\" referring to the conspiracy theory that Epstein maintained a black book of clients who engaged in sexual activity with minors on his properties.",
      "She speculated that she does not believe that Epstein died by suicide in jail, but she also doesn't think anybody on the outside caused him to be killed. She noted that, in the prison where she served at the time, \"somebody can pay a prisoner to kill you for $25 worth of commissary\" (she was moved to a lower-security facility following the interview).",
      "\"If it is indeed murder, I believe it was an internal situation,\" Maxwell said, adding that she does \"not have any reason to believe that\" he was killed to cover up information Epstein had.",
      "\"I also think it's ludicrous, because if that -- I also happen to think if that is what they wanted, they would've had plenty of opportunity when he wasn't in jail. And if they were worried about blackmail or anything from him, he would've been a very easy target,\" Maxwell said.",
      "Maxwell said law enforcement did not contact her during an initial investigation into Epstein in Florida in the 2000s, and she didn't discuss the case with Epstein. That probe controversially ended with federal authorities in Miami agreeing not to prosecute him, in exchange for Epstein pleading guilty to prostitution in state court. That deal is now key to Maxwell's efforts to appeal her criminal conviction, as she claims she's covered by a clause in the non-prosecution agreement that covers \"any potential co-conspirators.\"",
      "Maxwell's attorney David Oscar Markus thanked the Trump administration for releasing the transcripts in a statement posted to X. He also insisted that Maxwell is innocent.",
      "\"Ms. Maxwell answered every question. She did not refuse to respond and did not dodge any question. She supported her answers with documents and other objective evidence. Her demeanor and credibility are clear for anyone to hear,\" Markus wrote.",

      "A federal judge on Friday blocked the Trump administration from cutting off federal funding to dozens of \"sanctuary\" cities and counties \u2014 covering several of the largest cities in the U.S.",
      "The judge had previously ruled in April that it was unconstitutional for President Trump to freeze funding for local governments that limit their cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 commonly known as sanctuary cities. That ruling applied to more than a dozen cities and counties that had sued the Trump administration for threatening to cut off funding, including San Francisco, Sacramento, Minneapolis and Seattle.",
      "On Friday, San Francisco-based U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended his order to dozens of other places that joined the lawsuit. Those include the second- and third-largest cities in the U.S. \u2014 Los Angeles and Chicago \u2014 as well as Boston, Baltimore, Denver and Albuquerque.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said in a statement: \"The government \u2014 at all levels \u2014 has the duty to protect American citizens from harm. Sanctuary cities interfere with federal immigration enforcement at the expense of the safety and security of Americans citizens. We look forward to ultimate vindication on the issue.\"",
      "As Mr. Trump seeks to dramatically boost arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants, top administration officials have pushed local governments to assist \u2014 and they've sought to punish so-called sanctuary jurisdictions with laws on the books that prevent police from helping ICE.",
      "Within hours of returning to office in January, Mr. Trump ordered\u00a0his administration to ensure sanctuary jurisdictions \"do not receive access to Federal funds.\" Weeks later, the president ordered that federal funding shouldn't \"facilitate the subsidization or promotion of illegal immigration,\" and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the Justice Department will not offer grants to sanctuary cities. The administration argues sanctuary cities are interfering with federal law enforcement and making it harder for ICE to arrest undocumented immigrants, including violent criminals.",
      "The cities and counties that are suing the administration call those policies an \"abuse of power\" and allege they violate the Tenth Amendment, which says any powers that aren't given to the federal government should be reserved to the states. They argue that local governments are entitled to choose not to assist ICE, often casting sanctuary policies as a way of building trust between police and local residents whose immigration status may make them wary of reporting crimes.",
      "\"In flagrant disregard of the law, President Trump seeks once again to punish those who disagree with him, coerce local authorities, and commandeer them into carrying out his agenda,\" the cities' lawsuit says.",
      "The Trump administration's moves against sanctuary cities have generated a flurry of lawsuits, including one suit filed earlier this week by 20 states over the Justice Department's decision to tie crime victim grants to immigration enforcement.",
      "The Justice Department has also vowed to sue dozens of alleged sanctuary jurisdictions, including both cities and states. The administration sued New York City and the state of Illinois over their sanctuary policies earlier this year, though the Illinois suit was tossed out by a judge last month.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration may try to deport Kilmar Abrego Garcia to Uganda following his release from criminal custody, according to a senior Department of Homeland Security official and a notice sent by government officials obtained by CBS News.",
      "Hours after Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador earlier this year \u2014 was released from pre-trial detention in Tennessee on Friday, his attorneys were sent a court-required notice of his potential deportation to Uganda, the official said.",
      "The notice said he may be deported to the East African country \"no earlier than 72 hours from now,\" not including weekends.",
      "Earlier in the week, CBS News was first to report that Uganda had agreed to a U.S. request to accept deportees who are not its citizens, becoming the latest \"third country\" to strike a deportation agreement with the second Trump administration.",
      "A native of El Salvador, Abrego Garcia was held in a notorious Salvadoran prison for months, before being returned to the U.S. and jailed while awaiting trial on federal human smuggling charges. A judge ruled that he should be released from detention ahead of a trial set for January.",
      "In a legal filing Saturday, Abrego Garcia's lawyers revealed that the Trump administration had offered their client a \"last-ditch\" plea deal that would see him sent to Costa Rica after the completion of his criminal sentence. They submitted in federal court a letter from a Costa Rican government official that said the Central American country had agreed to accept Abrego Garcia as a refugee and provide him legal status there.",
      "But after Abrego Garcia declined that deal and was released from pre-trial detention, his lawyers confirmed they were notified by the Trump administration that he could face deportation to Uganda instead. Abrego Garcia was also directed to show up to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement field office in Baltimore on Monday morning. His lawyers said he has been told he has until then to accept the Costa Rica deal, or it will no longer be on the table.",
      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers said the Uganda deportation threat bolsters their argument that the Trump administration's prosecution of their client is vindictive.",
      "\"There can be only one interpretation of these events: the DOJ, DHS, and ICE are using their collective powers to force Mr. Abrego to choose between a guilty plea followed by relative safety, or rendition to Uganda, where his safety and liberty would be under threat,\" they wrote in the filing Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration has indicated for months that if Abrego Garcia is let out of jail, ICE could detain him and seek his removal from the U.S. yet again.",
      "In 2019, an immigration judge ruled that Abrego Garcia cannot be deported to El Salvador because he feared persecution by local gangs in the Central American country. The Trump administration said he was deported there anyway due to an \"administrative error.\"",

      "Abrego Garcia plans to return to Maryland, where he lived with his family prior to his March deportation. Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis ruled last month that the government must give him 72 hours' notice if it plans to initiate deportation proceedings.

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 06:19:49 -0400",
    "summary": "Residential electricity rates are expected to increase by as much as 18% in the next few years, according to the Energy Information Administration.",
    "story": [
      "If you noticed your utility bill has gone up this summer, you're not alone. On average, electricity costs are 5.5% higher today than they were a year ago, according to the latest federal data, and natural gas is up 13.8%.",
      "Nearly 60 utility companies are set to increase electricity rates this year by more than $38 billion, affecting more than 57 million Americans, according to analysis from the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank.",
      "President Trump recently commented on the rising prices, blaming them on renewable power. He wrote on Truth Social that renewables were \"THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!\" And he vowed he would not approve wind and solar projects.",
      "But higher rates are largely a result of higher demand, and that's being driven by the rapid expansion of artificial intelligence, oil and gas drilling, space heating and electrified forms of transportation \u2014 all technologies that require immense amounts of power, according to Rob Gramlich, president of Grid Strategies, a D.C. based energy consultancy firm, \"When supply is scarce, then prices go up,\" he said.",
      "Gramlich says that after 25 years of a flat demand for energy and a dip during the pandemic, demand rose once economic activity picked up after the pandemic was over.",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also played a role in higher costs, disrupting international energy supply chains and causing rates to go up in the U.S. Rapid growth in data centers and newer electrified forms of technology mean the nation will need 15% more capacity \u2014 or 120 gigawatts \u2014 by the end of the decade to keep pace, Gramlich estimated.",
      "The increasing demand is a big reason why the U.S. Energy Information Administration\u00a0expects residential electricity rates to increase steadily by as much as 18% in the next few years, far outstripping the annual inflation rate of about 2.7%.",
      "The fastest way to bring rates down would be to increase supply, but there are challenges.",
      "U.S. falling behind on transmission",
      "Gramlich, in recent testimony before Congress, said there's no shortage of fuel to add to the grid \u2014 it's a shortage of transmission that's the major problem.",
      "At the end of 2023, there were more than 2,600 gigawatts of energy waiting to get connected, representing over twice the current installed capacity of the U.S. power grid, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. And 95% of it was generated by solar, wind, and battery storage.",
      "To meet growing electricity needs, the U.S. needs to expand transmission systems by 60% by 2030, and even that may need to triple by 2050, according to a 2022 report by the Department of Energy.",
      "\"If we can get a lot of transmission built, then I think we can meet the AI-driven data center demands,\" Gramlich said.",
      "AI data centers consume far more power from the grid than regular data centers, says Norman Bashir, a fellow at MIT's Climate and Sustainability Consortium, where researchers are studying the impact of generative AI on the grid.",
      "\"AI data centers are much more power intensive,\" Bashir told CBS News Boston last month. \"So, if you have a normal data center, an AI data center would be up to 10 times more power intensive.\"",
      "Role of tariffs and equipment shortages",
      "Beyond the transmission backlog, Gramlich says tariffs and equipment shortages are making energy projects more expensive. One example \u2014 gas turbines are extremely scarce right now, and that's holding up the expansion of natural gas power plants.",
      "\"The price of an actual turbine has almost tripled,\" Gramlich said. And the wait time for a gas turbine is around three or four years \u2014 even as long as seven, according to a May\u00a0 analysis by S&P Global.",
      "Energy sources",
      "Over the past decade, the nation's energy mix has increasingly grown to favor natural gas and renewables, like wind, solar and hydropower, that have become much cheaper to produce. New nuclear plants won't be on line before 2030, Gramlich said, and coal is becoming less economically viable because of maintenance and update costs required to address pollution concerns.",
      "\"That leaves wind and solar and battery storage that can help in this decade,\" Gramlich told CBS News.",
      "But the Trump administration has enacted policies to curtail new clean energy projects and instead foster greater reliance on fossil fuels. Approving and permitting new clean energy projects has become increasingly difficult, taking away a valuable asset from energy providers at a critical time.",
      "\"If things keep going like this, [utility bills] are gonna be higher next year,\" Gramlich said.",
      "Trump energy policies projected to raise prices",
      "Upon returning to office, Mr. Trump issued a \"National Energy Emergency\" executive order, arguing the country needs \"reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy to drive our Nation's manufacturing, transportation, agriculture, and defense industries, and to sustain the basics of modern life and military preparedness.\"",
      "Most of the actions tied to that order have gutted renewable energy generation and are bolstering fossil fuel development.",
      "The passage of Trump's signature legislation, One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to make energy more expensive, impact jobs, and make it more difficult to meet rising energy demand, according to analysis by Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy think tank.",
      "OBBBA will change the tax code, increasing generation costs, resulting in a drop in power generation capacity of 340 gigawatts by 2035, says Michael O'Boyle, acting policy team director of Energy Innovation in an email to CBS News. To put that in perspective, 1 gigawatt typically powers 750,000 homes, so 340 gigawatts could power about 255 million homes.",
      "O'Boyle estimates wholesale energy prices will increase by 74% by 2035, resulting in a $170 annual increase in the average household energy bill. Some 760,000 jobs could be lost by 2030, and the states that are expected to see the biggest impacts on energy cost increases and job losses from the OBBBA are South Carolina, Florida, Texas, Kentucky and North Carolina.",
      "The Energy Department criticized the analysis and its support of renewables arguing, \"The OBBBA ensures taxpayers will no longer be forced to subsidize intermittent energy sources like wind and solar \u2013 subsidies that have only resulted in more expensive, less reliable energy,\" said Ben Dietderich, the department's press secretary and chief spokesman, in an email to CBS News.",
      "Ending Biden-era clean energy policies",
      "Since he returned to office, Mr. Trump has been dismantling Biden-era clean energy policies, resulting in the termination of more than $22 billion in renewable energy projects,\u00a0according to an analysis by the environmental policy firm E2.",
      "\"Unfortunately, the president and Congress is making it harder for Americans to have access to the cheapest, cleanest, quickest to deploy power there is,\" said Bob Keefe, E2's executive director.",
      "\"By slowing clean energy deployment, the Administration is directly fueling cost increases,\" Jason Grumet, CEO of the American Clean Power Association, said in a statement. Grumet cited EIA data and noted, \"The top four clean energy states are seeing prices decline this year, while the 10 states with the least renewable power all face rising costs.\"",
      "Trump admin. keeping fossil fuel generation alive",
      "To address rising energy demand, the Energy Department has ordered some utility companies to keep coal power plants open beyond their retirement dates, an action that could cost more than $3.1 billion a year by 2028, according to analysis by Gramlich's firm, Grid Strategies.",
      "\"These coal plants are basically uneconomic in the market. Each year, they incur tens of millions of dollars of maintenance just to stay operating,\" said Gramlich.",
      "Those costs to extend the life of coal plants will be borne by ratepayers, according to a ruling by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.",
      "Coal plants are generally planned for retirement when their operating cost exceeds their expected revenue or their value to the electric grid, the EIA\u00a0has pointed out. Coal-fired plants, which produce high levels of CO2 emissions, have been under pressure to be phased out in many states, in particular, those with clean energy goals. According to the EIA, natural gas and clean energy sources are providing a growing share of the nation's electricity, while coal has been waning. By the end of 2023, the maximum potential power plant output for coal was 15.2%, down from 45% in 1990.",
      "If additional fossil fuel-based plants delay retirement dates \u2014 28% were expected to be retired by 2035 \u2014 the bill to ratepayers could grow to more than $6 billion.",

    "summary": "A federal judge ordered an indefinite halt to further construction or expansion at \"Alligator Alcatraz,\" in a setback for the Trump administration and Florida officials.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday ordered an indefinite halt to new construction at an immigration detention facility that Florida officials have dubbed \"Alligator Alcatraz,\"\u00a0and barred any new detainees from being brought to the site, siding with environmental groups who said the facility is endangering the Everglades and its wildlife.",
      "The decision is a setback for Florida's Republican-led state government and its aggressive efforts to aid the Trump administration's hardline immigration agenda, including by deputizing thousands of state police as federal immigration officers.",
      "The order by U.S. District Court Judge Kathleen Williams did not require Florida officials to completely cease operations at Alligator Alcatraz, allowing the state to continue using existing structures there to detain immigrants suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. But Williams barred any more detainees from being transferred to the site \u2014 dashing plans to expand the detention center.",
      "The ruling says state and federal authorities cannot add any new tents to the site or carry out any paving or excavating, though they can repair existing facilities for safety purposes.",
      "It also directs them to remove temporary fencing, light fixtures and generators from the site within 60 days. Housing facilities can remain in place, the judge said.",
      "Williams wrote that, for decades, \"every  Florida  governor,  every  Florida senator,  and  countless  local  and  national  political  figures,  including  presidents,  have publicly pledged their unequivocal support for the restoration, conservation, and protection  of  the  Everglades.  This  Order  does  nothing  more  than  uphold  the  basic requirements of legislation designed to fulfill those promises.\"",
      "The state of Florida filed notice of appeal Thursday night.",
      "Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin blasted the ruling in a statement.",
      "\"This ruling from an activist judge ignores the fact that this land has already been developed for a decade. It is another attempt to prevent the President from fulfilling the American people's mandate to remove the worst of the worst including gang members, murderers, pedophiles, terrorists, and rapists from our country,\" she said.",
      "The makeshift detention facility \u2014 located in what was largely an abandoned airfield \u2014 is one of several locations and prisons that Republican-led states have offered the Trump administration so they can be converted into immigration detention centers. Officials in Indiana and Nebraska have also allowed facilities in their states to hold immigrants facing deportation.",
      "Thursday's ruling stems from a lawsuit filed by the Miccosukee tribe and environmental activists who challenged operations at Alligator Alcatraz on environmental grounds. The Everglades are an ecologically sensitive area that's home to endangered species, and many Floridians rely on the Everglades as a source of drinking water.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that environmental reviews mandated in federal law should have been completed before the site was set up.",
      "Florida officials have argued Alligator Alcatraz is not subject to those federal environmental requirements because the facility is run by the state. The Trump administration has said it will reimburse Florida for the effort using federal funds.",
      "Williams had paused further construction at Alligator Alcatraz earlier this month, but only for two weeks.",
      "A separate lawsuit over the legal rights of those held at the Everglades facility is also playing out.",
      "That case was partially dismissed by the U.S. District Court Judge Rodolfo Ruiz earlier this week, since the Trump administration had designated an immigration court to hear the claims of those detained at Alligator Alcatraz, one of the main concerns raised by the lawsuit. But Ruiz allowed another part of the case centered on detainees' right to in-person and confidential legal consultations to proceed, transferring the lawsuit to another federal judge.",

      "Sources familiar with the search told CBS News it is related in part to a classified documents investigation.",
      "FBI agents were also seen exiting a downtown Washington, D.C., building where Bolton's political action committee, John Bolton PAC, is located. Late Friday morning, the FBI confirmed agents were on site at his office for \"court authorized activity.\" The Associated Press reported that after the search at Bolton's home had begun, he was seen in the lobby of the building, talking to two people wearing FBI vests. Agents were seen taking bags into the office building through a back entrance.",
      "Bolton did not respond to multiple attempts to reach him. He was seen returning to his home after 2 p.m. ET. Just before he arrived, FBI agents could be seen carrying a number of boxes from his house. The New York Post first reported Bolton's home was being searched by the FBI.",
      "President Trump claimed Friday that he only found out about the search of Bolton's house when he saw it on TV. During a brief visit to the People's House museum, he told reporters he thought he'd be briefed on it by the Justice Department \"probably sometime today.\" The president called Bolton\"not very smart\" and said that \"we're gonna find out\" if he's \"a very unpatriotic guy.\"",
      "He claims that he tells AG Bondi and others \"I don't want to know\" and \"you have to do what you have to do,\" adding that he \"could be the one starting it\" but feels it's better coming from DOJ.",

      "Bolton served as national security adviser during Mr. Trump's first term, but resigned \u2014 or was asked to resign by Mr. Trump \u2014 after serving in the job for 17 months.",
      "During Mr. Trump's first term, Bolton wrote a book about his tenure as national security adviser, \"The Room Where It Happened,\" which portrayed Mr. Trump in an unflattering light. The first Trump administration tried to stop the publication of the book and later sued him for the profits. The Justice Department opened a criminal inquiry into whether Bolton had published classified information, claiming he had failed to complete a prepublication review.",
      "In June 2020, U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth denied the Justice Department's effort to stop the publication of Bolton's book, but after reviewing the classified materials at issue, said in his ruling that Bolton \"likely jeopardized national security by disclosing classified information in violation of his nondisclosure agreement obligations.\"",
      "\"Defendant Bolton has gambled with the national security of the United States,\" Lamberth also wrote. \"He has exposed his country to harm and himself to civil (and potentially criminal) liability.\"",
      "In November 2020, Mr. Trump claimed that Bolton \"illegally released much Classified Information\" in his book. He called Bolton \"a lowlife who should be in jail, money seized, for disseminating, for profit, highly Classified information,\" in another social media post.",
      "The Biden administration later closed the investigation into Bolton and dropped the lawsuit against him.",
      "Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's inauguration for his second term, his administration removed Bolton's U.S. Secret Service protection. Bolton had been granted the protection by the Biden administration in December 2021, after a series of threats from Iran that were linked to retaliation for a drone strike ordered by Mr. Trump during Bolton's tenure.

      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from Putnam County Jail in Tennessee on Friday and has been reunited with his family while he awaits trial, according to his attorney.",
      "It's the latest development in the case of a man who was mistakenly removed from the U.S. to an El Salvador prison where he\u00a0alleges he was tortured. Initially detained by immigration officials in March before being sent to El Salvador,\u00a0Abrego Garcia\u00a0returned to the U.S. in June to face criminal charges that were filed in Tennessee. The Justice Department has accused him of smuggling and gang membership, allegations his family denies. He pleaded not guilty to\u00a0two criminal counts\u00a0of human smuggling last month.",

      "\"For the first time since March, our client Kilmar Abrego Garcia is reunited with his loving family,\" attorney Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg said. \"While his release brings some relief, we all know that he is far from safe. ICE detention or deportation to an unknown third country still threatens to tear his family apart. A measure of justice has been done, but the government must stop pursuing actions that would once again separate this family.\"",
      "Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem condemned his release and suggested the Trump administration will continue to seek his removal from the U.S. She called a federal judge's ruling allowing him to return to Maryland a \"new low\" in attempts by \"activist liberal judges\" to \"obstruct our law enforcement every step of the way in removing the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens from our country.\"",
      "\"We will not stop fighting till this Salvadoran man faces justice and is OUT of our country,\" Noem said.",

      "Abrego Garcia's lawyers requested a delay of his release from jail in Tennessee earlier this summer, fearing that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could immediately detain him and try to deport him again. Last month, a federal judge in Maryland ruled that the government must return Abrego Garcia to supervised release under the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement office in Baltimore, re-implementing a 2019 order.",
      "Under that supervision order, issued in 2019, Abrego Garcia, who is Salvadoran, had permission to live in Maryland, as well as authorization to work. He was required to check in with an immigration officer at the ICE office in Baltimore. Court filings indicate Abrego Garcia was in compliance with the ICE supervision order when he was deported to El Salvador. The judge also ruled that Abrego Garcia must receive 72 hours' notice if the Trump administration plans to deport him anywhere other than his country of origin, El Salvador.",

    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "A day after CBS News published its report, DNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman said in a post on X that the reporting was false and said, \"U.S. intelligence sharing relationships with our allies have never been stronger.\"",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

At the same time, staff are reporting harassment in the wake of the attack and absorbing the impact of more than 600 job cuts that have dismantled entire public health programs.",
      "This week, officials confirmed that the suspect \u2014 who fired hundreds of rounds at the CDC's main campus on Aug. 8, killing a police officer \u2014 had attempted to enter the CDC visitors center two days prior, in what investigators believe was reconnaissance.",
      "The shooting came just days after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. revoked federal funding for mRNA vaccine research \u2014 a move celebrated by anti-vaccine groups. Investigators have said the suspect was fixated on distrust of COVID vaccines.",
      "In the days since, employees say they have been targeted with harassing phone calls. Callers have asked, \"Are you resilient?\" before playing the sound of gunfire. The taunts, drawn from the agency's own post-shooting messaging, have left staff shaken.",
      "Against this backdrop, the CDC announced a new panel chaired by MIT professor Retsef Levi to investigate concerns raised by critics of COVID mRNA vaccines. Restef himself has been outspoken in his criticism of the vaccines. Leadership framed it as an effort to counter misinformation, but many employees view it as a concession to disinformation narratives.",
      "The panel's creation has deepened unease inside an institution already under strain.",
      "In a letter sent after the attack, staff urged Kennedy to stop spreading inaccurate health information, affirm the CDC's scientific integrity and guarantee workforce safety.",
      "On Thursday, more than 600 CDC staff were officially let go, part of a wave of reductions in force approved by a federal judge earlier this month. Entire branches in the Division of Global HIV and Tuberculosis were eliminated, including teams that worked on preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission. Maternal and child health services, oral health programs, and the CDC's long-running Violence Against Children and Youth Surveys (VACS) were also cut.",
      "The VACS program, nearly two decades old, has provided countries with critical data to measure the prevalence of violence against children and to design interventions in response. \"The data we collected was catalytic,\" one researcher said. \"Overnight, that work is gone.\"",
      "The layoffs extended into injury prevention \u2014 a bitter irony, given that the agency was just targeted in a mass shooting. Staff who studied firearm-related deaths, concussions in young athletes, and fall prevention in older adults were among those dismissed.",
      "\"Injuries are a leading cause of death,\" said a veteran scientist whose unit was eliminated. \"Preventing them will result in fewer deaths. It's that simple. But our entire team was wiped away with a single letter.\"",
      "Other programs eliminated had decades of history. Global HIV prevention and treatment efforts date back to the 1990s, with CDC technical assistance shaping care for millions worldwide. Oral health and maternal-child health branches have likewise been longstanding pillars of domestic prevention work. Their abrupt closure, staff say, erases systems that took generations to build.",
      "Employees say the process itself has been isolating. \"It's been alienating and lonely,\" one longtime worker said. \"People we'd worked with for decades became afraid to even talk to us, and we were just cut off.\" Another added: \"We're not just lazy federal bureaucrats. We've poured our hearts and souls into this work, showing up day after day to keep people safe.\"",

      "Intel said that under the terms of the deal, the government agreed to purchase 433.3 million primary shares of Intel stock, valued at $20.47 per share, or the equivalent of a 9.9% stake in the company.",
      "In a\u00a0Truth Social post early Friday evening, Mr. Trump wrote that it was his \"Great Honor to report that the United States of America now fully owns and controls 10% of INTEL.\"",
      "Trump added that the U.S. \"paid nothing for these Shares, and the Shares are now valued at approximately $11 Billion Dollars.\"",
      "Why did Trump want this deal?",
      "In his second term, Mr. Trump has been leveraging his power to reprogram the operations of major computer chip companies. The administration is requiring Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, two companies whose chips are helping to power the craze around artificial intelligence, to pay a 15% commission on their sales of chips in China in exchange for export licenses.",
      "Mr. Trump's interest in Intel is also being driven by his desire to boost chip production in the U.S., which has been a focal point of the trade war that he has been waging throughout the world. By lessening the country's dependence on chips manufactured overseas, the president believes the U.S. will be better positioned to maintain its technological lead on China in the race to create artificial intelligence.",
      "Earlier this month, the president called on Tan to resign less than five months after the Santa Clara, California, company had hired him. The demand was triggered by reports raising national security concerns about Tan's past investments in Chinese tech companies while he was a venture capitalist.",
      "But Mr. Trump backed off after Tan professed his allegiance to the U.S.\u00a0in a public letter\u00a0to Intel employees and went to the White House to meet with the president, who applauded the Intel CEO for having an \"amazing story.\"",
      "After enjoying decades of growth while its processors powered the personal computer boom, the company fell into a slump after missing the shift to the mobile computing era unleashed by the iPhone's 2007 debut.",
      "Intel has fallen even farther behind in recent years during an artificial intelligence craze that has been a boon for Nvidia and AMD. The company lost nearly $19 billion last year and another $3.7 billion in the first six months of this year, prompting Tan to undertake a cost-cutting spree. By the end of this year, Tan expects Intel to have about 75,000 workers, a 25% reduction from the end of last year.",
      "Has the U.S. government done something like this before?",
      "Although rare, it's not unprecedented for the U.S. government to become a significant shareholder in a prominent company. One of the most notable instances occurred during the Great Recession in 2008 when the government injected nearly $50 billion into General Motors in return for a roughly 60% stake in the automaker at a time it was on the verge of bankruptcy. The government ended up with a roughly $10 billion loss after it sold its stock in GM.",
      "Lutnick told CNBC during a Tuesday interview that the government has no intention of meddling in Intel's business, and will have its hands tied by holding non-voting shares in the company. But some analysts wonder if the Trump administration's financial ties to Intel might prod more companies looking to curry favor with the president to increase their orders for the company's chips.",

      "What federal grants does Intel receive?",
      "Intel was among the biggest beneficiaries of the Biden administration's CHIPS and Science Act, but it hasn't been able to revive its fortunes while falling behind on construction projects spawned by the program.",
      "The company has received about $2.2 billion of the $7.8 billion pledged under the incentives program.",

    "summary": "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from pre-trial detention and head edback to his home state of Maryland \u2014 but it's unclear if ICE will seek to deport him again.",
    "story": [
      "Kilmar Abrego Garcia was released from detention on Friday and headed back to his home state of Maryland, the latest move in a months-long saga that has become a symbol of President Trump's crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "Abrego Garcia was detained in March, mistakenly deported to El Salvador, held for months in a notorious prison where he alleges he was tortured, and eventually returned to the U.S. in June \u2014 only to face criminal charges in Tennessee. The Trump administration has accused him of gang membership and smuggling, allegations he and his family have staunchly denied.",
      "A Nashville-based federal magistrate judge ordered Abrego Garcia to be released from jail two months ago while he awaits a criminal trial set to begin in January. That order had been delayed at the request of Abrego Garcia's lawyers, who feared that Immigration and Customs Enforcement could immediately detain him and try to deport him again.",
      "The latest delay to Abrego Garcia's release from jail ran out on Friday and Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes entered an order for his release. His lawyers confirmed he was free Friday afternoon.",
      "But it's unclear if or when Abrego Garcia will be detained by ICE yet again.",
      "What happens after Abrego Garcia is released?",
      "Holmes was expected to set conditions for Abrego Garcia's release when she issues her order allowing him to walk out of jail.",
      "Then he planned to return to Maryland, where he and his family lived prior to his March detention by ICE. Abrego Garcia's lawyers said in court papers this week that they hired a private security company with \"experience providing court-approved pre-trial transportation and security services in criminal cases\" to bring him to Maryland.",
      "His attorneys have asked Holmes to give him 48 hours following his departure from jail to report to pre-trial services in Maryland. The Justice Department \u2014 which has opposed releasing Abrego Garcia \u2014 said this week it isn't opposed to a 48-hour grace period, noting that Abrego Garcia is expected to wear an electronic monitoring device once he leaves custody.",
      "Upon his release, immigration agents aren't allowed to immediately take Abrego Garcia into custody in Tennessee, under a ruling last month by Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis. When he gets back to Maryland, the government must put him back into the same ICE supervision program that he belonged to before he was detained, and they need to give him 72 hours' notice if they plan to initiate deportation to a country other than El Salvador, said Xinis.",
      "Can Abrego Garcia be deported again?",
      "Xinis' order does not prevent ICE from initiating immigration proceedings against Abrego Garcia once he returns to Maryland. She wrote last month that the government \"may take whatever action is available to them under the law.\"",
      "But if he's detained by ICE again, the government's plans for where he'd be sent are unclear.",
      "\"There's been no decision made, as he is not in ICE custody,\" Thomas Giles, assistant director for ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations, told Xinis last month.",
      "Giles said ICE would take custody of Abrego Garcia \"as soon as possible,\" and would determine \"based on bed space availability\" where to hold him.",
      "In June, Justice Department attorney Jonathan Guynn told Xinis the government would seek to deport Abrego Garcia to a \"third country\" \u2014 that is, a country other than El Salvador. He added that there were \"no imminent plans\" to remove him from the United States.",
      "However, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson called a June report on Abrego Garcia's possible deportation \"fake news,\" writing on X: \"He will face the full force of the American justice system - including serving time in American prison for the crimes he's committed.\"",
      "There are legal barriers to deporting Abrego Garcia to his home country of El Salvador \u2014 which he left more than a decade ago before entering the U.S. illegally at the age of 16.",
      "In 2019, a judge barred the government from sending him to El Salvador, on the grounds that he feared persecution by local gangs. Despite that ruling, the Trump administration sent him to El Salvador in March \u2014 where he was held at the notorious CECOT mega-prison. A government attorney later admitted in court that the move was an \"administrative error.\"",
      "That error set off the court saga surrounding Abrego Garcia. Xinis had ordered the government to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court affirmed. But he remained in the Central American country for months as the Trump administration claimed it was up to the Salvadoran government to decide whether to return him, drawing frustration from Xinis, before he was finally flown back to face criminal charges in June.",
      "What charges is Abrego Garcia facing?",
      "Abrego Garcia was federally charged in June with conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawful transportation of undocumented aliens.",
      "The government alleges that Abrego Garcia was involved in a smuggling ring that transported undocumented immigrants from Texas to elsewhere in the U.S. Federal prosecutors also accused Abrego Garcia of belonging to the Salvadoran gang MS-13.",
      "\"As we have said since Day 1, this M13-gang member and human trafficker won't be on \u2026 American streets again,\" Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement earlier this week.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorneys have strongly denied the government's allegations, including claims that he belonged to MS-13. Earlier this week, his lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the charges, accusing the Trump administration of engaging in a \"vindictive and selective prosecution.\"",
      "His attorneys wrote Tuesday that \"the only possible explanation for the timing of the charges here is that the government chose to use this prosecution to punish Mr. Abrego for exercising his right to challenge the violations of due process that led to his unconstitutional deportation, incarceration, and torture in El Salvador.\"",

And after we do this, we'll go to another location, and we'll make it safe, also.\"",
      "\"Chicago's a mess,\" he continued. \"You have an incompetent mayor, grossly incompetent. And we'll straighten that one out probably next, that'll be our next one after this.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump called on Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook to resign on Wednesday after one of his administration's officials alleged she had engaged in mortgage fraud and urged an investigation.",
      "On Friday, the president took it a step further: \"I'll fire her if she doesn't resign,\" he said.",
      "Bill Pulte, who Mr. Trump appointed as director of the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency in March, made the allegations on X, claiming Cook committed mortgage fraud after designating two homes as her primary residence.",
      "The housing regulator also shared an August 15\u00a0letter he sent to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Department of Justice official Ed Martin outlining the alleged mortgage fraud. The letter points to documents obtained by the agency, which Pulte claims show Cook falsified bank and property records to \"obtain more favorable loan terms.\"",
      "Pulte alleges Cook pledged in a June 2021 mortgage agreement to buy an Ann Arbor, Michigan, property that she would make the home her primary residence for at least one year, but then two weeks later purchased an Atlanta condominium, which she allegedly also agreed to make her primary residence for a year.",
      "Mortgage rates for primary homes are typically lower than those offered by banks for secondary residences, such as vacation homes or investment properties,\u00a0according to Rocket Mortgage.",
      "In response to Pulte's allegations, Mr. Trump wrote \"Cook must resign, now!!!\" on Truth Social Wednesday morning. The president has also told aides he is considering firing Cook, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited a senior White House official and another person familiar with the matter.",
      "Pulte also called on the Federal Reserve governor to resign, and said on X that he believes the Justice Department will open a criminal investigation into the alleged mortgage fraud.",
      "The White House did not offer additional comment.",
      "Cook says she won't quit",
      "Cook late Wednesday said she wouldn't leave her post at the Fed. \"I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,\" she said in a statement issued by the Fed.",
      "\"I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts,\" she added.",
      "Mr. Trump's call for her to resign comes as the president has been urging the Fed to cut interest rates, while deriding\u00a0Chairman Jerome Powell over the Fed's caution in lowering borrowing costs. Cook holds one of the seats on the 12-person Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, the group at the central bank that makes the decision on whether to cut, hold or raise interest rates based on a majority vote among its members.",
      "Fed set to cut interest rates?",
      "The president has also been\u00a0pushing\u00a0Congress to confirm the nomination of Stephen Miran to the Fed's Board of Governors. Mr. Trump\u00a0appointed Miran, one of his top economic advisers, to serve on the board on an interim basis earlier this month following the resignation of Gov. Adriana Kugler.",
      "Removing Cook from her role and adding Miran \"would not materially alter the composition of the FOMC,\" noted Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with TD Securities, in a research note.",
      "It's also unlikely Miran could be confirmed before the Fed announces its next rate decision on Sept. 17 because the Senate doesn't reconvene until Sept. 2, and a vote would require an \"aggressive schedule\" by the Senate banking committee, Seiberg added.",
      "Wall Street expects Mr. Trump's fervent wish for a rate cut to be granted soon, with economists pegging the probability at 88% that the Fed will lower rates on Sept. 17, according to financial data company FactSet.",
      "In the meantime, Seiberg said he views it as unlikely that Cook will resign before the September Fed meeting.",
      "\"For Cook, resigning will not end the legal probe. It is why we see no incentive for her to react to Pulte by departing before the next FOMC meeting,\" he wrote.",
      "Cook joined the Fed's Board of Governors in May 2022, according to her biography. Prior to her appointment, Cook was an economics professor at Michigan State University.

      "\"This is massive,\" Noem said in a statement, crediting the decline in part to an ad campaign warning undocumented immigrants to leave or face arrest and deportation.",
      "\"This new data shows illegal aliens are hearing our message,\" she added. In the Department of Homeland Security's news release, Noem did not specify how many of those individuals were believed to have departed the U.S. voluntarily, versus those who have been deported.",
      "But the vast majority would have had to have left without making any contact with DHS to reach that total. According to internal government figures previously obtained by CBS News, over the first six months of President Trump's second term, the administration deported nearly 150,000 people and recorded 13,000 who self-deported.",
      "A DHS spokesperson told CBS News that it sourced the 1.6 million figure from its own numbers out of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, although its news release included a chart from an analysis released earlier this month by the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that supports immigration restrictions.",
      "It did not provide additional information on how USCIS calculated this estimate.",
      "Any estimate of the current unauthorized population at this stage comes with caveats, researchers who study population demographics told CBS News, and it's too early to conclude that there's been a mass exodus.",
      "A new analysis from the Pew Research Center, released Thursday, estimated that there were 14 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. as of 2023. That's the latest year for which data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey is available \u2014 the survey that experts say is the gold standard for making these population estimates.",
      "The Pew Research Center's analysis found that the undocumented immigrant population swelled by 3.5 million from 2021 to 2023, driven largely by recent arrivals during the Biden administration.",
      "It had previously declined by 1.1 million between the start of the Obama administration and the end of the first Trump administration, Pew found.",
      "Meanwhile, the analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies is based on another Census Bureau survey known as the Current Population Survey. The CPS polls about 60,000 households \u2014 about 2% of the size of the American Community Survey's sample \u2014 making some estimates less reliable. Experts also note some immigrants may not respond amid increased enforcement.",
      "The Pew Research Center analyzed the CPS data as well, and found similar results, showing the unauthorized immigrant population may have continued to grow into 2024 and started to decline in 2025.",
      "\"For [20]25, all we have is CPS data and that points to a decline from a January peak of immigrants,\" Jeffrey Passel, the Pew report's lead author, told CBS News. \"How big the decline is could be affected by the decrease in response rates.\"",
      "To estimate the unauthorized population, researchers typically subtract the number of immigrants with legal status from the overall foreign-born population. Estimating the foreign-born population in the absence of the American Community Survey can be tricky.",
      "The Census Bureau, which oversees both surveys, cautions against using the Current Population Survey to estimate the foreign-born populations due to its sample size.",
      "Zooming in on the foreign-born population within the CPS survey makes a small sample size even smaller, introducing wide margins of error, experts say. The foreign-born population makes up about 14% of the total U.S. population, according to the latest ACS survey.",
      "The analysis from the Center for Immigration Studies estimated that the total foreign-born population, which includes both legal and illegal immigrants, fell by 2.2 million between January and July, including 600,000 non-citizens with legal status.",
      "Steven Camarota, the lead author on that analysis, said the decline in the overall foreign-born population is statistically significant, or not due to chance, despite the wide margins of error. He noted that response rates have declined for more than a decade, but haven't prevented the survey from tracking the previous increases in the foreign-born population prior to January 2025.",
      "Data is not available on the response rates among foreign-born people compared with U.S.-born people surveyed, so it isn't clear how much of the recent decline in the response rate is reflective of a drop off among immigrants.",
      "\"Given that the foreign-born is a small minority of the population, you can have a meaningful decline in the foreign-born response rate without having much of a decline in the overall response rate,\" Jed Kolko, an economist who served as under secretary of commerce for economic affairs during the Biden Administration, told CBS News.",
      "Still, Kolko said there are other indicators that the unauthorized population has begun to decline. Industries that rely heavily on labor from unauthorized workers, such as construction, hotels and restaurants, have seen greater drops in employment than all other industries, according to his analysis of a Bureau of Labor Statistics survey of employers rather than households.",

    "published": "Tue, 19 Aug 2025 07:36:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump says he plans to sign an executive order \"to end mail-in ballots, because they're corrupt.\" Here's what to know about his claims.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump promised Monday to work to end mail-in voting and said work is already underway on an executive order to ban it before the 2026 midterm elections, although the Constitution does not give him this power.",
      "\"We, as a Republican Party, are going to do everything possible that we get rid of mail-in ballots,\" he said during an Oval Office meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"We're going to start with an executive order that's being written right now by the best lawyers in the country to end mail-in ballots.\"",
      "Why does Trump want to ban mail-in ballots?",
      "\"Mail-in ballots are corrupt,\" the president said. He suggested the method is susceptible to voter fraud, claiming in California, \"it's so corrupt, where some people get five, six, seven ballots delivered to them.\" He has often insisted mail-in ballots can be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.",
      "But soon after the 2020 election, Debra Cleaver, founder and CEO of VoteAmerica, a nonpartisan voter information site, dismissed the idea of widespread voter fraud as \"a myth.\"",
      "\"The outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted,\" she explained to CBS News.",
      "After that election, the director of the nation's cyber security agency, Christopher Krebs, called the 2020 vote \"the most secure in American history.\"",
      "In 2024, when Mr. Trump won the presidential election, the U.S. Census Bureau said nearly a third of ballots nationwide were cast by mail.",
      "The White House told CBS News in a statement that Democrats had \"eroded faith in our elections\" with policies like \"unfettered mail-in voting.\"",
      "\"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said Monday night.",
      "Trump's impending executive order to stop mail voting \u2014 would it be legal?",
      "In a social media post earlier in the day, the president said of the impending order that it would \"help bring HONESTY to the 2026 Midterm Elections.\"",
      "He claimed that the states \"are merely an 'agent' for the Federal Government in counting and tabulating the votes,\" and that \"[t]hey must do what the Federal Government, as represented by the President of the United States, tells them, FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY, to do.\"",
      "But Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says it's the states that have the authority to regulate elections, not the president, and this may be changed only by Congress.",
      "Trump claims U.S. is the only country that uses mail-in voting. Is that true?",
      "Mr. Trump also claimed, \"We are now the only Country in the World that uses Mail-In Voting\" and argued, \"You will never have an honest election if you have mail-in. And it's time that the Republicans get tough and stop it, because the Democrats want it. It's the only way they can get elected.\"",
      "In fact, more than 30 other countries allow voting by mail for some or all voters, according to the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, an intergovernmental advocacy group based in Sweden. Canada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany\u00a0and Denmark are among them.",
      "Mail-in voting in the U.S.",
      "In the U.S., mail voting is widespread:\u00a036 states offer some form of no-excuse mail-in voting \u2014 including 8 states that conduct elections entirely by mail \u2014 while the rest require a documented reason such as illness or military service, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The pandemic gave mail voting a huge boost in the 2020 elections. About 43% of voters cast their ballot by mail that year, according to a report by the Election Assistance Commission. In 2024, mail voting dropped off, representing just over 30% of the total votes cast \u2014 about 46.8 million votes. The commission said that last year's numbers still exceeded pre-pandemic levels.",
      "The topic of mail-in voting came up during Mr. Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin last Friday, too. After the two met Friday, the president told Fox News' Sean Hannity that \"Vladimir Putin, smart guy, said, 'You can't have an honest election, election with mail-in voting.' And he said, 'There's not a country in the world that uses it now.'\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the two talked about the 2020 election and that Putin told him, \"You won that election by so much, and that's (mail voting) how [Biden] got it.\" Audits and investigations, including some conducted by Trump supporters and Republican secretaries of state, showed no evidence that the 2020 election results were inaccurate.",
      "David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research, pointed out in a statement to CBS News that mail-in voting has been around since the Civil War and said getting rid of mail voting \"is an incredibly bad idea that would make our elections much less secure and vulnerable to interference.\"",
      "\"Requiring states to eliminate or replace the voting machines that confirmed the election of this president, just 15 months before a midterm election and less than a year before primaries, is not possible and would result in chaos,\" said Becker, who is also a CBS News election law contributor.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told CBS News in a statement Monday night that \"President Trump wants to secure America's elections and protect the vote, restoring the integrity of our elections by requiring voter ID, ensuring no illegal ballots are cast, and preventing cheating through lax and incompetent voting laws in states like California and New York.\"",
      "\"Democrats have eroded faith in our elections with reckless laws, such as unfettered mail-in voting, illegally changing laws to benefit their voters, and slow-walking the counting of votes far past Election Day,\" Fields said.",

      "The animals that live on the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute's sprawling 32,000 acres in Northern Virginia are connected by one thing: the threat of extinction.",
      "Tucked away in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, more than 20 species at risk of extinction, including Mongolia's Przewalski's\u00a0horse, which disappeared from the wild at the end of the 1960s, live on the institute's\u00a0grounds. There are red pandas, maned wolves, and clouded leopards, to name a few more.",
      "The institute studies a species' reproduction, ecology, genetics, migration, and conservation sustainability, with the ultimate goals of saving wildlife from extinction and training future conservationalists. In certain cases, the scientists are responsible for breeding and reintroducing them to their habitats.",
      "But those who work to conserve these species and remove them from the endangered species list are still concerned with the rate at which species are vanishing.",
      "\"We're seeing species disappearing at 10, 100, to 1000 times the normal background rate,\" SCBI conservation biologist Melissa Songer\u00a0told CBS News.",
      "The International Union for Conservation of Nature warned in early 2025 that 28%, or more than 47,000, of the world's assessed species are at risk of extinction. That number includes more than just animal species, showing crucial insect, plant and tree species are also threatened.",
      "\"So we think, okay, well, we're losing the species here and there, you know, there's a lot of other species,\" Songer says, \"but the thing is, that when we lose one species, it has cascading effects.\"",
      "A great example of this effect is with the black-footed ferret, which originally inhabited the North American Great Plains but has been endangered since 1967. While the species remains on the endangered list, its population has grown since preservation efforts began at the Institute.",
      "\"Every animal in the ecosystem is important for that ecosystem,\" says Adrienne Crosier, a cheetah biologist at SCBI, \"they all have a really important role to play.\"",
      "When it comes to the black-footed ferret, Crosier says they are \"a mix of predator and prey for other larger carnivores,\" meaning that other animals are left without a food source in the ferret's absence.",
      "\"Anytime you take a species completely out of the ecosystem, you cause an imbalance in that ecosystem,\" Crosier says.",
      "Crosier's team is currently caring for approximately 60 ferret kits, which will be released into the Colorado wild in the Fall.",

      "If all goes well, the cargo ship will move in for docking at the station's forward port at 7:30 a.m. Monday. On board: more than 2,400 pounds of crew supplies, nearly 1,000 pounds of science gear, 1,300 pounds of space station hardware, computer equipment and spacewalk gear.",
      "The food includes the usual variety of fresh, asked-for items for the crew, including coffee, tea and more than 1,500 tortillas.",
      "\"We fly tortillas because ... other breads and things like that have too many crumbs and things of that nature (that float away in weightlessness), so you can't actually maintain it in orbit,\" said Bill Spetch, ISS operations and integration manager. \"Tortillas are a great substitute for that.\"",
      "On a more significant note, Heidi Parris, associate program scientist for the space station, noted that NASA will mark 25 years of continuous human presence aboard the lab in November.",
      "During that quarter century, she said, \"we've hosted more than 280 residents, we've enabled more than 4,000 different ... scientific experiments and technology demonstrations (representing) the work of over 5,000 researchers from over 110 countries around the world.\"",
      "The CRS-33 mission will bring 50 research projects to the lab, including a new study of the effects of microgravity on bone loss, a 3D metal printer to assess the capability for manufacturing spare parts and tools on demand in space and an experiment to study the effectiveness of 3D \"bioprinting.\"",
      "\"This investigation ... is looking to create a 3D-printed implantable medical device that can support nerve regrowth after injury by bridging the gap to reconnect severed nerves while also simultaneously delivering drugs that can support nerve regeneration,\" Parris said.",
      "Of special interest to NASA is the performance of an add-on propulsion system consisting of two SpaceX Draco engines, six propellant tanks and a supply of helium to pressurize the system. The hardware is mounted in the Dragon's open-to-space aft trunk section.",
      "\"The space station's altitude slowly decays over time due to the thin amount of atmosphere still at our altitude,\" Spetch said. \"To counteract that drag, we must occasionally raise the altitude of the ISS.\"",
      "The Russians handle the majority of those re-boost operations, delivering the needed propellants and periodically firing thrusters aboard Progress cargo ships and the station itself.",
      "\"With the addition of the boost trunk on this mission, Dragon will also provide this ability to maintain the station's altitude,\" Spetch said. \"The boost kit will help sustain the orbiting lab's altitude starting in September with a series of burns planned periodically throughout the fall of 2025.\"",
      "The CRS-33 Dragon will remain docked to the station until December. During that time, the boost kit will provide the one-and-a-half Progress missions.",
      "Sarah Walker, director of Dragon mission management at SpaceX, said the boost kit will provide about a quarter of the propulsion needed in one year to maintain the station's 260-mile-high altitude. The first \"burn,\" expected to last about 20 minutes, is planned for Sept. 3.",

    "summary": "During its secretive mission, the X-37B will test new laser communications gear and a \"quantum\" navigation sensor.",
    "story": [
      "A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off late Thursday, propelling a reusable X-37B Space Force rocket plane into space on a classified long-duration mission. It was the eighth such flight since the program's debut in 2010 and the first since a 434-day mission ended last March.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 roared away from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at 11:50 p.m. EDT, arcing onto a northeasterly trajectory atop 1.7 million pounds of thrust from the booster's nine first-stage engines.",
      "After the spacecraft climbed out of the lower atmosphere, the engines shut down, the first stage fell away, flipped around and re-ignited three engines to reverse course and head back to Florida. Heralded by an attention-getting sonic boom, the booster landed at the nearby Cape Canaveral Space Force Station to wrap up its sixth flight.",
      "It was SpaceX's 66th booster landing in Florida and the company's 490th successful recovery overall.",
      "As usual with classified Space Force missions, SpaceX ended its launch commentary with the first stage landing and offered no information about the Falcon 9's second stage climb to orbit, when the Boeing-built X-37B was to be released to fly on its own, or any details about its orbit.",
      "The seven previous X-37B missions -- three by the orbiter launched Thursday and four by a twin sister ship -- all carried out long-duration missions ranging from 224 days to nearly 909 days. It's not known how long the X-37B launched Thursday will remain in orbit.",
      "While the flights are generally classified, Space Force and Boeing officials publicly discussed two of the payloads on board.",
      "One  will test high-speed, tightly-targeted laser communications between the  X-37B and small data relay satellites making up a growing  \"proliferated\" space-based communications system.",
      "The tests \"will mark an important step in the U.S. Space Force's  ability to leverage proliferated space networks as part of a diversified  and redundant space architecture,\" said Gen. Chance Saltzman, director of space operations for the U.S. Space Force.",
      "\"In so doing, it will strengthen the resilience, reliability, adaptability and data transport speeds of our satellite communications architecture.\"",
      "The other publicly disclosed payload is a sophisticated quantum navigation sensor designed to determine a spacecraft's precise position in space by \"detecting rotation and acceleration of atoms without reliance on satellite networks like traditional GPS,\" the Space Force said in an on-line description.",
      "\"Whether navigating beyond Earth-based orbits in cislunar space or operating in GPS-denied environments, quantum inertial sensing allows for robust navigation capabilities when GPS navigation is not possible,\" said Space Delta 9 commander Col. Ramsey Horn.",
      "\"Ultimately, this technology contributes significantly to our thrust within the Fifth Space Operations Squadron and across the Space Force guaranteeing movement and maneuverability even in GPS-denied environments.\"",
      "Clad in black heat shield tiles and white insulation blankets, the unpiloted X-37B resembles a mini space shuttle with stubby delta wings and two tail fins extending from either side of the rear of the fuselage. It can be launched atop SpaceX Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets or United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 and Vulcan boosters.",
      "Two virtually identical X-37B Orbital Test Vehicles, or OTVs, are operated by the Pentagon's Rapid Capabilities Office for the U.S. Space Force. The vehicles are designed to serve as test beds for avionics and advanced sensors, to evaluate reusable spacecraft components and to provide a platform for experiments that can be returned to Earth for analysis.",
      "Powered by solar cells and batteries, the orbiters feature a small payload bay similar to a space shuttle's that can accommodate a variety of sensors and experiment packages.",
      "The compact spacecraft are designed to end their missions with runway landings at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California or the Kennedy Space Center in Florida using 3-mile-long runways originally built for the space shuttle.",
      "The most recent flight of an X-37B began with a\u00a0launch atop a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket on Dec. 29, 2023. It ended last March 7, with touchdown at the Kennedy Space Center after 434 days and six hours in space. Going into Thursday's mission, the two X-37Bs had logged a combined 11-and-a-half years in space across seven flights.",

    "published": "Sat, 23 Aug 2025 08:00:14 -0400",
    "summary": "Tommy Fello struggled to regain function after a stroke affected the left side of his body. A new technology is making a difference.",
    "story": [
      "Restaurateur Tommy Fello was driving from his Ohio establishment to his house on Christmas Eve when he started veering off the road. Fello, then 71, had been awake since 4 a.m. local time preparing a holiday buffet for his family. He chalked the disturbance up to a flat tire. Driving slowly and relying on the vehicle's autocorrect feature, he was able to complete his journey home safely.",
      "But when Fello stepped out of the truck, he couldn't get his balance.",
      "\"I finally realized it wasn't the truck that was veering. It was me that was veering,\" Fello said. He went indoors and talked to his wife and daughter, who said he looked unwell. About five minutes later, they called 911. Paramedics took him to an area hospital, where he lost all movement in his left arm and leg.",
      "\"They were literally just like appendages on me. I could not feel them and could not do anything,\" Fello said.",
      "A clot-busting drug reversed the stroke, but the numbness on the left side of his body, including his face, remained. He struggled to swallow, eat or drink. Physical and occupational therapy produced only minor improvements.",
      "Dr. Sharon Covey, Fello's occupational therapist and the founder of the Center for Stroke and Hand Recovery, Inc., told CBS News that his arm was essentially stuck in a bent position with his fingers curled when he met her in January 2024. The position and tension in the limb caused Fello constant pain. Working in his restaurant was out of the question.",
      "\"It was very scary. You take for granted so many of the things you do, and even the common, simplest things become like a chore,\" Fello said. \"We mark all these small victories ... Being able to lift up your arm or pick up a cup is a gigantic accomplishment. Those little accomplishments are gigantic to a stroke victim. They encouraged me to keep going on. But there was always a thought in the back of my mind: 'Is this as good as it's going to get?'\"",
      "A \"first-of-its-kind technology\"",
      "One day, another recovering stroke patient suggested Fello look into an implant called the Vivistim System. The FDA-approved implant, developed by the medical device company MicroTransponder Inc., uses vagus nerve stimulation during rehabilitation to improve hand and arm function for stroke victims. The vagus nerves are the body's longest cranial nerve, with one on each side of the body, according to the Cleveland Clinic. They regulate the body's involuntary functions.",
      "The Vivistim Therapy system involves a physical or occupational therapist sending wireless signals to the device. That signal delivers a brief, gentle pulse to the vagus nerve while the stroke patient performs rehabilitative tasks. The stroke patient also does at-home exercises.",
      "Dr. Erez Nossek, a neurosurgeon and director of the cranial bypass program at NYU Langone, told CBS News that the vagus nerve stimulation can enhance the brain's ability to rewire itself, known as neuroplasticity. That increased neuroplasticity can result in \"greater and faster improvements in motor function for stroke survivors,\" Nossek said in emailed remarks.",
      "\"There is no other FDA-approved technology proven to boost neuroplasticity for stroke survivors, creating new connections in the brain, which is theirs to keep, even after the device is no longer in use,\" Nossek said. \"This is (a) first-of-its-kind technology that is redefining what is possible for this patient population.\"",
      "A 108-person trial\u00a0published in The Lancet in 2021\u00a0found that the device generated two to three times greater improvement in hand and arm function for stroke survivors when compared with just rehab. Stroke patients who have limited hand and arm function six months or more after their stroke and are considered to have \"moderate to severe deficits\" qualify for the device, the company\u00a0said in a fact sheet.",
      "Implant aids in recovery",
      "Fello turned to the Cleveland Clinic, where he met cerebrovascular neurosurgeon Dr. Mark Bain. He studies stroke recovery, especially in the cases of patients like Fello, whose rehab progress has plateaued months after the stroke. Bain determined that Fello was a candidate for the Vivistim System. Fello became the first Cleveland Clinic patient to receive the implant on April 29, 2025.",
      "\"It didn't really scare me to try and do it. I was anxious to see how it worked,\" Fello said.",
      "The device was placed during an hour-long procedure. The vagus nerve sits just below the carotid artery, so Bain and his surgical team made a small incision to place the leads of the implant and hid the scar in a fold of Fello's neck. The key-fob sized implant was placed under Fello's clavicle. Bain said the procedure itself is low-risk, with \"less than 1% chance of any complications.\" Two weeks after the surgery, the device was turned on and Fello returned to his rehabilitative work with Covey.",
      "Covey said Fello has made huge progress since the device was implanted four months ago. She said he has no pain or tension in the limb, and is beginning to practice using his left arm to carry items. The task is difficult, she said, but isn't \"something he could have done before.\" Fello, now 72, said he's been thrilled by the progress he's made in a short time.",
      "\"I'm very, very happy to do it, very proud to do it, and I'm glad I did it,\" he said.",
      "\"The sky's the limit\"",
      "About 800,000 people in the United States experience an ischemic stroke each year, Bain said. Vivistim and other new technologies may offer hope to the patients like Fello who struggle to recover with just rehabilitation, Bain said.",
      "\"I think over the next probably five to 10 years, what you're going to see is an explosion of procedures, devices and things in rehab that will help people, once they've had strokes, to get their lives back,\" Bain said. \"In the future, I think the sky's the limit for what we can expect for stroke recovery.\"",
      "At the time of his conversation with CBS News, Bain had given seven other stroke patients a Vivistim implant. Covey said at her practice, there are eight patients with the implant receiving the paired therapy course. MicroTransponder Inc. declined to say how many patients have received the implant, but shared a map that shows dozens of surgeons and rehabilitation therapists that provide the therapy.",
      "\"I think this is the newest, most effective strategy for people getting their affected limbs back,\" Covey said. \"This is the first real technique that has been available, at least in the last 20 years, for stroke rehab. The theories that we use as practitioners to increase somebody's use of their affected arm are 50 to 75 years old. So this is a new technology that's really going to turn the stroke recovery world upside down.\"",

      "The burrito chain is touting Zipotle as a superior delivery service that helps customers get their food faster, so that it stays fresh. Everything on Chipotle's menu is available for drone delivery in the Dallas area, the company added. Orders for Zipotle delivery need to be placed through the Zipline app, available through the Apple and Android app stores.",
      "Here's how it works",
      "Once a customer places an order, a Chipotle worker then packs it and places it at a Zipping Point where a Zip drone picks up the order and delivers it to the customer. When the autonomous aircraft arrives at a customer's home, it hovers about 300 feet in the air while lowering and \"gently\" placing the order on the ground, the company states.",
      "Chipotle said the first location to offer Zipotle delivery is at 3109 Lakeview Pkwy, in Rowlett, a suburb in the eastern part of Dallas.",
      "\"Zipotle is a quick and convenient source of delivery that lets guests enjoy our real food from places that are traditionally challenging to serve, including backyards and public parks,\" Curt Garner, president and chief strategy and technology officer at Chipotle said in the announcement.",
      "\"With Zipline, you tap a button, and minutes later food magically appears \u2014 hot, fresh, and ultra-fast,\" Zipline CEO and co-founder Rinaudo Cliffton said in the same announcement. \"What once felt like science fiction is soon going to become totally normal,\" he added.",

      "Cracker Barrel shed almost $100 million in market value Thursday after its stock plunged following the release of a new logo. The new design eliminates a longstanding drawing of an overall-clad man leaning against a barrel, in favor of a cleaner logo featuring just the chain's name.",
      "Shares of Cracker Barrel fell $4.22, or 7.2%, to $54.80 in Thursday trading, shedding $94 million in market value. The stock had dipped to a low of $50.27 earlier in the day, representing a loss of almost $200 million in its capitalization.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares gained in early trading Friday, but resumed their slide later in the day. The stock closed down 40 cents, or less than 1%, to $54.40.",
      "Wall Street's reaction to the logo redesign comes as Cracker Barrel has been working to refresh its image through new menu items and redecorated stores that eschew the 55-year-old chain's old-timey approach in favor of a more modern look.",
      "According to the company's website, the man and barrel in the old logo represented \"the old country store experience where folks would gather around and share stories.\"",
      "It's unusual for a company's share price to plunge dramatically due to a logo redesign, although marketing missteps can cause investors to question a company' strategy. Cracker Barrel's overhaul has been overseen by CEO Julie Felss Masino, who last year described the chain as \"not as relevant as we once were,\" and announced plans to update its down-home menu.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Cracker Barrel said that the man portrayed in the logo, known as \"Uncle Herschel,\" will remain \"front and center in our restaurants and on our menu.\"",
      "\"Our values haven't changed, and the heart and soul of Cracker Barrel haven't changed,\" the company said.",
      "The new logo, which will appear on menus and marketing materials, \"is now rooted even more closely to the iconic barrel shape and wordmark that started it all,\" the company said in an Aug. 18 press release.",
      "Conservative commentators took issue with the rebrand, with right-wing podcaster Matt Walsh calling it \"more generic\" on social media. Marketing experts also criticized the company's overhaul. Many of the criticisms took on a political tone, with some social media commenters describing the new design as \"woke.\"",
      "Brand strategist Kelly O'Keefe, a founding partner of consultancy Brand Federation, said the redesign simplifies an \"overly complex logo.\"",
      "\"In a normal marketing environment, this would not even be noticed, but these are not normal times,\" O'Keefe said in an email. \"Politically inert marketing moves are being labeled as political for opportunistic reasons.\"",
      "Another marketing expert pointed out that the redesign risks turning off long-time fans of the chain, with Bolt Health founder Kevin Dahlstrom, who has served as a chief marketing officer at several companies in the financial industry, describing Cracker Barrel's rebrand as a \"fiasco.\"",
      "\"The holy grail of marketing is to create a brand that customers give a damn about \u2014 and feel some ownership of. It's exceedingly rare and when you have that \u2014 as Cracker Barrel did \u2014 you NEVER EVER abandon it, you only double down on it,\" Dahlstrom wrote on social media.",
      "Cracker Barrel was founded in 1969 and today operates nearly 660 corporate-owned locations across the U.S.",
      "Cracker Barrel's growth, which soared in the 1990s as the chain expanded, has slowed in recent years. For 2024, the company reported revenue of roughly $3.5 billion, up 0.8% from $3.4 billion the previous year, while net income fell to $40.9 million for year, down from $99 million in 2023.",
      "For its most recent quarter, the company reported revenue of $821.1 million, up slightly from $817.1 million, according to a regulatory filing.",
      "Cracker Barrel shares have risen 7% this year to $55.42 as Friday morning, but the stock has fallen sharply since 2018, when it topped $180.",

    "story": [
      "Palestinians sheltering in tents or seeking scarce food aid were among at least 33 people killed by Israeli strikes and shootings Saturday in Gaza, according to local hospitals, as the world confronted an exceptional announcement that famine is now gripping Gaza's largest city.",
      "The famine determination by the world's leading authority on food crises galvanized governments and aid groups to intensify pleas for Israel to halt its 22-month offensive on Gaza, prompted by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks. Aid groups have warned for months that the war and Israel's restrictions of food into Gaza are causing starvation among civilians.",
      "Israel denounced the famine declaration as lies and the military is pressing ahead with preparations to seize Gaza City. Efforts toward a ceasefire that could forestall the offensive are on hold as mediators await Israel's next steps.",
      "Israeli strikes killed at least 17 people in the southern Gaza Strip early Saturday, according to morgue records and health officials at Nasser Hospital. The officials said the strikes targeted tents sheltering displaced people in Khan Younis, which became home to hundreds of thousands who had fled from elsewhere in Gaza. More than half of the dead were women and children.",
      "Awad Abu Agala, uncle of two children who died, said no place in Gaza is now safe.",
      "\"The entire Gaza Strip is being bombed ... In the south. In the north. Everywhere,\" Abu Agala told The Associated Press, saying the children were targeted overnight while in their tents.",
      "A grieving relative, Hekmat Foujo, pleaded for a truce.",
      "\"We want to rest,\" Foujo said, fighting through her tears. ''Have some mercy on us.''",
      "In northern Gaza, Israeli gunfire killed at least five aid-seekers Saturday near the Zikim crossing with Israel, where U.N. and other agencies' convoys enter the enclave, health officials at the Sheikh Radwan field hospital told the AP.",
      "Six people were killed in other attacks on Gaza elsewhere Saturday, according to hospitals and the Palestinian Red Crescent.",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to questions about the deaths.",
      "A famine announcement ups the pressure",
      "A report by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that Gaza City is gripped by famine that is likely to spread if fighting and restrictions on humanitarian aid continue.",
      "It was a highly rare pronouncement by the group, its first in the Middle East, and came after Israel imposed a 2 1/2-month blockade on Gaza earlier this year, then eased access with a focus on a new U.S.-backed private aid supplier, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF.",
      "In response to global outrage over images of emaciated children, Israel in recent weeks has allowed airdrops and a new influx of aid entering by land, but U.N. and other aid agencies say the quantity of food reaching Gaza is still insufficient.",
      "AP journalists have seen chaos and security problems on roads leading to aid delivery points, and there have been reports of Israeli troops firing toward aid-seekers. Israel's military says they fire warning shots if individuals approach the troops or pose a threat to soldiers.",
      "The IPC said nearly half a million people in Gaza, about one-fourth of the population, face catastrophic hunger that leaves many at risk of dying. It said hunger has been magnified by widespread displacement and the collapse of food production.",
      "Netanyahu's office denounced the IPC report as \"an outright lie,'' and accuses Hamas of starving the hostages. Israel says it has allowed enough aid to enter during the war.",
      "Activity is escalating ahead of Gaza City offensive",
      "With ground troops already active on the edges of Gaza City, a\u00a0wide-scale operation there\u00a0could start within days.",
      "Aid group Doctors without Borders, or MSF, said Saturday its clinics around Gaza City are seeing high numbers of patients as people flee recent bombardments. The group said in a statement that \"strikes are forcing people, including MSF staff, to flee their homes once again, and we are seeing displacement across Gaza City.\"",
      "The Israeli military has said troops are operating on the outskirts of Gaza City and in the city's Zeitoun neighborhood.",
      "Israel says Gaza City is still a Hamas stronghold, with a network of militant tunnels. The city also is home to hundreds of thousands of civilians, some of whom have fled from elsewhere.",
      "Ceasefire efforts await Israel's response",
      "Many Israelis fear the assault on Gaza City could doom the roughly 20 hostages who have survived captivity since 2023.",
      "Netanyahu said Thursday he had instructed officials to begin immediate negotiations to release hostages and end the war on Israel's terms. It is unclear if Israel will return to long-running talks mediated by the United States, Egypt and Qatar after Hamas said earlier this week that it accepted a new proposal from the Arab mediators.",
      "Hamas has said it would release captives in exchange for ending the war, but rejects disarmament without the creation of a Palestinian state.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump expressed frustration with Hamas' stance, suggesting the militant group was less interested in making deals to release hostages with so few left alive.",
      "\"The situation has to end. It's extortion, and it has to end,\" Trump told reporters Friday. \"I actually think (the hostages are) safer in many ways if you went in and you really went in fast and you did it.\"",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry said Saturday that at least 62,622 people have been killed since the war began, including missing people now confirmed dead by a special ministry judicial committee.",

      "Democratic Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, who is the vice chair of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee, said in a statement, \"The firing of yet another senior national security official underscores the Trump administration's dangerous habit of treating intelligence as a loyalty test rather than a safeguard for our country.\"",

The assessment said that the\u00a0strikes\u00a0had set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, three sources familiar with its contents told CBS news shortly after the airstrikes.",
      "The DIA's findings also indicated some of Iran's enriched uranium stockpile had been moved before the strikes, according to one of the sources.",
      "That assessment prompted a backlash from the Trump administration, since President Trump had\u00a0said\u00a0in an address to the nation following the strikes that \"Iran's nuclear enrichment facilities have been completely and totally obliterated.\" He said the U.S. strikes had set back the Iranian nuclear program \"basically decades.\"",

      "Editor's note: This article contains descriptions and an image of hate speech found on the Roblox servers and might be triggering to some readers.",
      "In Roblox, one of the world's largest online gaming platforms, users join to play, create, and be themselves in a virtual world \u2014 but some might be there for a more insidious purpose: to expose youth to hate speech.",
      "Players of \"Spray Paint!\" \u2014 a popular game on Roblox, with over a billion visits, in which players skate and create graffiti art in a virtual skatepark setting \u2014 can bypass moderation by spray painting hate messages across walls, ramps and other virtual game settings, a CBS News investigation found.",
      "CBS News documented dozens of swastikas and at least a dozen instances of hate speech targeting minority groups across Spray Paint! servers, which host multiplayer games. There are millions of games on Roblox where players can join servers to play with friends and strangers.",
      "What's happening in \"Spray Paint!\" is not uncommon \u2014 nor surprising. Roblox currently has at least 18 active lawsuits pending nationwide due to inappropriate content found on its games, attorney Matthew Dolman, whose firm is representing individuals in cases against Roblox, told CBS News.",
      "Roblox said in an emailed statement to CBS News that its 24/7 moderation system closely monitors the platform, and that the company takes \"swift action against any content or users found to be in violation.\"",
      "However, hate speech still appears in Roblox games, like Spray Paint, CBS News found. \"Within three minutes of getting in there for the first time, I also saw a swastika,\" said Rachel Franz, the early childhood advocacy program director at the nonprofit Fairplay, which advocates for children's online safety.",
      "Hate can run rampant across various Roblox games. A group called Active Shooter Studios recreates school shootings at Columbine, Uvalde and Parkland and consistently evades efforts to take down recreations, the Anti-Defamation League found in an April report. A lawsuit filed this month alleges that Roblox hosted hundreds of Sean \"Diddy\" Combs-themed games, as well as more than 900 user accounts registered across Roblox with variations of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's name.",
      "\"Roblox is fully aware that these experiences pervade its app, and it allows them to continue to exist unchecked despite the ability to control or eliminate them,\" the lawsuit alleges, and said the effects on children can be devastating.",
      "Last week, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill filed a child protection lawsuit against the platform.",
      "\"Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,\" Murrill, a Republican, alleged in a press release. \"Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger posed to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Roblox said, \"We share Attorney General Murrill's urgency to help keep kids safe because safety has always been our priority,\" adding that it looks forward to working with Murrill to help keep children safe.",
      "\"We share the critically important goal of keeping kids safe online and any assertion otherwise is categorically untrue,\" Roblox's statement said. \"We hold ourselves to the highest standard and work constantly to remove violative content and bad actors.\"",
      "What children are encountering",
      "Predators can troll Roblox, experts say, and other similar gaming platforms, to recruit young players for extremist groups or possibly sexual exploitation.",
      "Children and teens make up more than half of Roblox players, and about 40% of players are under the age of 13, according to a 2024 U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Roblox attracts an average of 97.8 million daily active users.",
      "\"If you are a predator, it's very clear that there are opportunities to access vulnerable folks on these platforms,\" Franz said.",
      "When children play the Spray Paint! game, they might see slurs targeting Black and Jewish people and phrases like \"KKK\" and \"Jew\" etched in graffiti on virtual brick walls. In one server, there were over 14 instances of this speech, CBS News found, as well as a reference to the \"Third Reich.\"",
      "The phrase \"I can't breathe,\" the words uttered by George Floyd, who died in 2020 in police custody by an officer later convicted of murder, was written across a virtual brick wall in one server. Some servers had graphic sexual drawings, and in another, there was an instance of suicidal language, CBS News found.",
      "Roblox's chat feature, available in some games, has a filtering system that prevents inappropriate content, like discriminatory speech, from being visible, but in Spray Paint! players can bypass filtering mechanisms by scrawling text via the game's paint feature as opposed to writing in the chat, where content is filtered.",
      "Users must enter their birthday when creating a Roblox account, but the platform doesn't require authentication, meaning adults can pose as children and children can pose as older than they actually are. Kids can converse with other players via the voice chat feature \u2014 which has a minimum age requirement of 13 \u2014but also doesn't require age verification.",
      "Roblox says the company has implemented what it calls a \"trusted flagger program,\" where trusted partners can report \"terrorist content\" in an effort to crack down on hate messages.",
      "Roblox also says on its website that content uploaded to be incorporated into games is evaluated in a multi-step review process to screen for child sexual abuse material and other inappropriate content. If it is identified as fodder for possible child sexual abuse, Roblox says it is automatically reported to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, a nonprofit organization focusing on finding missing children and reducing child exploitation.",
      "Roblox has developed an artificial intelligence system that the company says helped submit about 1,200 reports of potential attempts at child exploitation to NCMEC \u2014 and last year, Roblox submitted 24,522 reports to NCMEC overall.",
      "Roblox says it has a human review team continuously evaluating flagged games and encourages users to report concerning activity. Spray Paint! players have the option to play in \"safe mode,\" which allows them to only view art created by other players who are on their \"friends\" list in the app.",
      "A Roblox spokesperson told CBS News in an emailed statement that \"while no system is perfect,\" the company has implemented safeguards including \"restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing, as well as content maturity [l]abels and parental controls.\"",
      "\"We share with our community the critically important goal of keeping everyone safe online and ensuring users have positive experiences on Roblox that align with our strict Community Standards,\" the statement said, adding, \"We continuously innovate to deter bad actors and have launched over 50 safety features since last year.\"",
      "Despite efforts to curb extremism and the targeting of young players, experts and CBS News found that protections remain easy to override.",
      "\"There's a larger question of how you regulate and moderate something that is supposed to encourage creativity and freedom of expression, but actually ends up introducing some really unsafe and truly harmful and disgusting practices,\" Franz said.",
      "A double-edged sword",
      "Allegations in several cases suggest Roblox has also been used to exploit teens and children. A Florida teenager was arrested\u00a0in April for allegedly targeting children on Roblox, where he would demand child sexual abuse material over text messages or the messaging platform Discord. In Texas, a lawsuit filed in April alleges a 13-year-old girl was groomed and sexually exploited on Roblox and later, Discord. Roblox has recently been hit by a spate of lawsuits with similar claims. Dolman said his firm currently has seven cases and is investigating 400 more. Another firm filed a lawsuit earlier this month against Roblox and Discord representing over 400 people.",
      "A man in California was arrested\u00a0in April on kidnapping and sexual misconduct charges in connection with a 10-year-old he is believed to have met through Roblox. Last year, a woman in Florida was arrested for allegedly using Roblox to instruct a 10-year-old to kill an infant by dropping the 2-month-old on a tile floor. The infant was seriously injured.",
      "When asked for a response to the lawsuits, Roblox said in an email that the company is \"deeply troubled\" by any incident that endangers its users, noting that safety is a top priority.",
      "\"Roblox is committed to empowering parents and caregivers to help ensure a safe online experience for their children.\"",
      "Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced in April that he issued a subpoena to Roblox.",
      "\"There are concerning reports that this gaming platform, which is popular among children, is exposing them to harmful content and bad actors,\" he said in a press release. \"We are issuing a subpoena to Roblox to uncover how this platform is marketing to children and to see what policies they are implementing\u2014if any\u2014to avoid interactions with predators.\"",
      "Open-world games like Spray Paint!, where users can roam a virtual space in relative anonymity, can be a double-edged sword. Doris Chang, a psychologist and associate professor at New York University's Silver School of Social Work, says that these spaces can be affirming for queer youth.",
      "\"They can be whoever they want. Gender fluidity is really common,\" Chang said, adding it can also put those groups at risk for exposure to hate speech and predatory individuals.",
      "\"You're just interacting with people that you wouldn't normally interact with. It's completely wide open,\" Chang said.",
      "Chang said when children play a game like Spray Paint! without parental supervision, they may have to navigate problematic scenarios that might be confusing or upsetting.",
      "\"It brings up the larger question about how much parents know about what their kids are getting exposed to online,\" she said. \"Broadly speaking, Roblox is just one corner of the internet that our kids are navigating.\"",

    "title": "4 reasons why the Trump tariffs haven't caused U.S. inflation to soar",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-tariffs-trump-inflation-prices/",
    "published": "Thu, 21 Aug 2025 08:56:00 -0400",
    "summary": "For months, economists warned that the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs would sharply boost consumer prices. Here's why it hasn't happened.",
    "story": [
      "Despite a barrage of new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration this year on dozens of U.S. trade partners, the prices of goods and services across the U.S. have defied many economists' expectations and remained relatively stable.",
      "Economists caution that just because tariffs have yet to trigger a renewed bout of inflation, there is no guarantee that prices won't surge later this year. They note that recent data shows a modest rise in the cost of items including clothing, home furnishings and appliances.",
      "Tariffs \u2014 meaning the rate importers must pay at the border for imported goods \u2014 also take a long time to seep into the economy. That's because companies often try to hold off on passing along higher costs to customers to avoid losing market share to rivals.",
      "Yet experts acknowledge that tariffs have yet to unleash the kind of severe inflationary pressures that could cause prices to spike. For their part, White House officials have consistently maintained that foreign exporters \u2014 not American consumers \u2014 will bear the brunt of added tariff costs.",
      "\"Despite the doom-and-gloom predictions of inflation and recession, it's been months since Liberation Day, and inflation is trending towards an annualized rate not seen since President Trump's first term, while a recent [Council of Economic Advisers] analysis found that prices of imported goods are actually declining,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch, alluding to the baseline and other tariffs President Trump originally announced on April 2.",
      "Here are four reasons economists say explain why inflation isn't jumping despite the highest U.S. tariffs in decades.",
      "Tariffs aren't as high as many people expected",
      "Despite President Trump's many threats to jack up levies on imports, the actual average tariff rate being charged on U.S. imports is not as high as what has been announced, data shows.",
      "The average tariff rate on U.S. imports in June was 9% \u2014 well below the 15% that many economists were forecasting earlier this year following Mr. Trump's\u00a0slew of tariff announcements, according to investment advisory firm Capital Economics.",
      "\"It's not so much that the reaction to tariffs has been low, it's that the effective tariff rate increase has been relatively limited up until June,\" Mark Cus, an economist at Barclays, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Actual U.S. tariffs remain lower than earlier estimates in part because countries facing steeper levies are sending fewer goods to the U.S., according to Barclays and Capital Economics. By contrast, countries with below average tariff rates are shipping more goods to the U.S.",
      "The upshot: Average tariff rates on imports are lower than many economists were projecting earlier this year.",
      "Additionally, many goods imported into the U.S. have been exempted from steeper tariffs. Of the roughly $258 billion worth of imports that hit the U.S. retail market in June, only 48% were subject to tariffs, Barclays data shows. For example, pharmaceuticals, some electronics and many imports from Canada and Mexico are exempt from any new tariffs.",
      "\"While dutiable goods face elevated tariff rates, a substantial portion of U.S. imports remains duty-free,\" Barclays analysts said in a recent report. \"This is a major contributor to the low effective tariff rate.\"",
      "Companies stocked up before higher tariffs kicked in",
      "U.S. retailers built up their inventories earlier this year in expectation that the Trump administration would hike tariffs on imported products and parts. Many retailers are still selling those non-tariffed products, allowing them to delay price hikes, experts said.",
      "For example, \"There was a big jump in imports of goods from Canada that would later be tariffed before the tariffs kicked in, and perhaps imports of those goods in May and June were relatively low, and that shows up as a smaller amount of dutiable goods,\" Barclays' Cus told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Eventually, experts warn, retailers will exhaust those lower-cost goods imported earlier in the year, which could lead to higher prices down the road.",
      "Retailers are swallowing the costs \u2014 for now",
      "For now, many retailers are eating the additional tariff costs.",
      "Businesses \"have been willing to absorb the initial hit via lower margins, although we suspect that was mostly a temporary development as those firms waited for more clarity on where tariff rates would settle,\" analysts with investment adviser Capital Economics said in a recent report.",
      "\"We doubt that is a sustainable outcome over the longer term, however. As the uncertainty over tariff levels eases over the next couple of weeks, giving retailers more clarity on rates over the next year or two, we would expect more firms to raise prices,\" they said.",
      "Tariffs tend to boost inflation gradually",
      "Tariffs typically take many months to seep into company supply chains and show up in the prices consumers pay at the store.",
      "The full impact of tariffs plays out not immediately but over an extended period of time, peaking roughly a year after they take effect, a June Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas\u00a0report\u00a0noted. That means any U.S. tariffs imposed this year would be unlikely to have much of an impact on inflation until later this year and into 2026.",
      "\"Up to now there has been only limited passthrough from tariffs into final consumer prices, but we still expect the impact to gradually mount in the second half of this year,\" Capital Economics analysts said in a report.",
      "A final possibility is that the fears that the Trump administration's turn toward protectionist trade policies would trigger another severe bout of inflation are overblown. The White House has maintained that such a shift will protect jobs and make the U.S. more competitive globally.",
      "\"The Administration has consistently maintained that the cost of tariffs will be paid by foreign exporters who rely on access to the American economy, the world's best and biggest consumer market,\" the White House's Desai said in a statement.",

      "The following is the transcript of an interview with UNICEF executive director Catherine Russell that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We return now to Gaza and that stunning declaration Friday about a monitoring group that Gaza City is experiencing man-made famine, and that those conditions will expand soon. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell joins us now. We want to warn our viewers, there will be some upsetting images in this segment. Executive Director Russell, thank you for joining us. We've spoken so many times over the past few years about the catastrophic starvation. Now you have this technical designation- so rare to see a famine here. They project it's going to spread. Can you explain, in real-world terms, what does this mean for the children who live there?",
      "CATHERINE RUSSELL: Well, thank you, Margaret. Let me say this: You know, it's been, now, almost two years since October 7th, and since then, Israeli children have been killed and taken hostage, and now we're seeing Palestinian children finally facing what we've been yelling and screaming about for months and months and months, which is a terrible famine. You know, we've estimated at this point that about 18,000 children in Gaza have already died. And those are children who die from a whole range of issues. But when you think about that, that's about 28 children a day. That's almost a classroom of children every single day who have died since the beginning of this conflict. We have been saying we beware, right, this- this famine is just right around the corner, and it's- it's almost like you're screaming into an abyss, you know. It's so- it's shocking that it's happened, because, as you said, it happens so rarely, but it's not surprising. And what it means, really, is that children have been spending months and months without sufficient food. And we see just a horrible situation where children are on the verge of starvation and ultimately dying from starvation. And I think, you know, for your viewers who haven't seen this, and hopefully many of them have not, it is a haunting image. Children literally waste away. And you see it in rooms where you know suddenly they're all quiet. The children are so quiet because they have no energy even to cry, and to see that happen, and especially in a place where food is not very far away, right? There's no reason for this. This did not happen because there were cyclones or, you know, droughts. This happened because we could not get enough aid in to these children.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And as you know, the Israeli government entity that oversees the Palestinian territories, it's called COGAT, says there is no famine. They say the UN data is flawed. The Prime Minister's office says these are fabrications and due to prejudice. Can you explain how you know what you know? We are showing images that we know journalists have shot- journalists who live inside Gaza, because journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report. How do you know that what you're saying is fact?",
      "RUSSELL: Let me say two things about that. One is the IPC, which is the organization that makes this determination, is an independent organization. They're technical people. They're not political people, and they monitor this as they go, and they look at issues like, what are the levels of food deprivation, what's the acute malnutrition level, how many starvation-related deaths, so it's a very technical assessment. And I think we've seen in other places that this is very accurate. I would also say it- to me, it's kind of obscene that we are having these conversations arguing about whether the methodology works or not. We know children are dying, right? I am tired of a discussion about, well, are we giving the right information or not? First of all, let the international press in. Let them make determinations. I mean, we've talked about this, Margaret, of you coming, you should be it yourself. Everyone should be able to get in there. Absent that, we're going to have to rely on the data that we have the people who were there, and I can tell you, from the UNICEF perspective, our people are tortured by this. I mean, I have spoken to our staff, and they are seeing children who are incredibly deprived, many thousands of children who have had amputations, and are, you know, it's just one terrible thing after another for children. And to suggest that there's anything funny going on here is really, in my mind, just- almost making the situation worse, right? Just stop the discussion, stop arguing, and address the problem. Get food in there. Take care of these children, make sure that they have the wherewithal to survive and have a distant future.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN",
      "And the Israeli government controls who gets in and who gets out. On the question, though, of making sure that the food you do get in gets to the right people: The former US Ambassador to Israel, Jack Lew, and another Mid-East Envoy have said the UN agencies may not like it, but if the Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is the only thing really allowed to operate, then maybe there needs to be some compromise. Why- why not? The United States government is putting $30 million to work there. Why not work with them?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, I- the methodology of the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation is not something that is consistent with the way humanitarians work. That's a simple answer. And honestly, you know, if you think about it, the UN had 400 places where we would distribute aid. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation had four, okay? And you have seen on television, you have seen this video of these almost apocalyptic situations where people are streaming towards these places, trying to get food, people are getting shot. It's a terrible situation, and it doesn't work. It's not working that well. Now look, I don't- I don't much care if the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation does some distribution. Just let us our let us do our work, too. Let us in. We know how to do this distribution. And when I say we, it's not just UNICEF, it's the UN, it's the other international NGOs. We do it all around the world. We've done it for decades. We know how to do it. We know how to do it in a way that it gets to the people who need it. And I, you know, do both. I'm fine with that, but at least make sure that humanitarians can get in there and distribute the aid fairly, and make sure that these children are not dying unnecessarily. Nobody wants that. President Trump has said that nobody wants that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He did indeed. I want to ask you, as well, about Sudan, where there was a massive humanitarian crisis. If the United States is not leading efforts to get aid in there, is anyone else stepping up?",
      "RUSSELL: You know, look, the United States has the ability to be such a force for good, and we need them to step up and do more. Sudan, as you say, is the largest displacement crisis in the world. Millions of children are on the move. They are not in school. We now have a horrible outbreak of Cholera, which is very destructive and kills children within hours if they can't get aid. I mean, it is absolutely horrific. And the United States can be such a force for making positive contributions. And I think, you know, other countries are trying, but the US really can make a much bigger difference if they try to do this work, and do it as quickly as possible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And in Sudan, what is the generational impact here? When you don't look --",
      "RUSSELL: Oh, it's horrible. First of all, they're not getting food. They're facing horrible sexual violence. I was just in Chad and heard stories that could just break your heart, and it's devastating, and the results, as you say, will last for generations.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you for sharing that. That's it for us today. Thank you for watching. I'm Margaret Brennan."

    "story": [
      "The following is the transcript of an interview with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Aug. 24, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Good morning and welcome to 'Face The Nation.' It's quiet here in Washington as we come on the air this morning, but the debate is heating up over President Trump's calling up of nearly 2300 National Guardsmen, along with federal agents from ICE, the ATF, the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, and others, to patrol the streets of the city alongside DC police forces. And we're seeing yet another instance of Trump's expanding of the federal government's reach, this time when it comes to control of police in local communities. Will we see pictures like these in other U.S. cities in the future? Well, one of the places President Trump has mentioned is needing help fighting crime is nearby Baltimore, and joining us right now is Maryland's Democratic Governor Wes Moore. Thank you for being here.",
      "GOV. WES MOORE: Thank you so much for having me.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So they're here in DC- there are guardsmen from six different states on the street. The mission is, quote, 'beautification, duty and support.' The defense secretary has author- authorized them to carry M4 and M17 rifles, but to date, we have not been able to locate anyone armed within the National Guard on the streets of DC. Why, though, are you so opposed to this deployment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Well, there's- there's plenty of reasons. You know one, it is not sustainable. You cannot continue this type of pace of operations, particularly when you're when it's costing over a million dollars a day in order to do this. The second, it's not scalable. You're not going to be able to do this in every single major American city, particularly when many of the cities that have the highest crime rates are the places that have actually deployed their national guards to Washington, DC. So who's going to- who's going to go do the work in their cities? The third, it's unconstitutional. It's a direct violation of the 10th Amendment, and for a party that talks about state rights, it's amazing how they're having such a big government approach in the way they're conducting public safety. The fourth reason is because it's deeply disrespectful to the members of the National Guard. As someone who actually deployed overseas and served my country in combat, to ask these men and women to do a job that they're not trained for is just deeply disrespectful. And so when we're thinking about all of these lasting factors, when we're thinking about the fact that it serves as a distraction from the fact that the President's disastrous economic policies are making everything more expensive for everyday Americans- is making life harder for everyday Americans, there is a multitude of reasons that I am against this, and I will not authorize the Maryland National Guard to be utilized for this.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the National Guard does say that these troops will be trained and deputized by Federal Marshals. So this is going to be distinct from the military rules of engagement",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it is counter to every bit of training that we received. When- when I joined the military, we joined with a clear intention to fight and win our nation's wars. The members of our National Guard are trained up to be able to address things like emergency situations, situations where you need- where you need a surge of supports for- for traumas and disasters that are happening within individual jurisdictions. That is not this, and this is a direct deflection that the President is authorizing.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: We know the President watches the program, and he likely saw the guest listing because he's tweeting about you- or truthing, I guess. He says the Governor Wes Moore of Maryland has asked in a 'nasty and provocative tone that I walk the streets of Maryland with him,' and he's talking about 'crime ridden Baltimore.' It's quite lengthy, but he goes after your record on crime. He says it's a 'bad one.' He says, if you need help, he will send in the troops, which is being done in nearby DC. I mean, when we saw a few weeks ago the deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the governor of California tried to go to the courts, and he was unable to stop it. Is the reality here is- you can't stop the president from sending troops to Baltimore if he wants to?",
      "GOV. MOORE: The year before I became the governor, in 2022, Baltimore was averaging almost a homicide a day, and I came in and I said, I refuse to be a governor who just offers thoughts and prayers to this situation. So we said we're actually going to work in partnership with Mayor Scott, work in partnership with local elected officials, work in partnership with local- with local law enforcement. We made the largest investments in local law enforcement in our state's history. Over $50 million going to Baltimore City alone\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: That came from federal money.",
      "GOV. MOORE: No that came from both federal and state money, and also Maryland became one of the only states that actually helps to fund the U.S. Attorney out of balance sheet, taking many of those gun crimes and actually turning them into federal charges. And the results have been- have been incredibly encouraging, where Maryland's had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime of anywhere in the United States in the past two and a half years. The homicide rate in Maryland is down over 20% since I have been the governor, and the last time the homicide rate was this low in Baltimore City, I was not born yet. And so the reason that I've asked the President to come and join us is because he seems to enjoy living in this blissful ignorance. This- these tropes, in these 1980s scare- scare tactics. And you know, just last week I was in Baltimore, and I was with a group called 'We Our Us' who is a violence intervention group. And they say we're all we got, we're all we need. And that's exactly how people in this community feel. Because while the President is spending his time from the Oval Office making jabs and attacks at us, there are people actually on the ground doing the work who know what supports would actually work to continue to bring down crime, but it's falling on deaf ears of the President of the United States.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're talking about the positive trend line. The President's pointing to the FBI statistics, which shows Baltimore is the fifth most instances of violent crime on a per capita basis. Fourth highest murder rate. To your point, the city of Memphis is also on that list, and the Governor of Tennessee sent those National Guard troops here to this city, not to the streets of Memphis--",
      "GOV. MOORE: \u00a0--And we know we have work to do. We know- if one person does not feel safe in their neighborhood, that's one too many. But we also know what tactics actually work and what tactics is just theatrics.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But your- the mayor in Baltimore did just say he wants federal help-- he doesn't want National Guard troops, per se, though, he says he wants agents from FBI, DEA and ATF, do you need more federal help in policing if your mayor thinks you do?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Oh, absolutely. And we need the President to stop cutting funding. Because if you look at the President's budget, it actually cuts funding towards violence intervention groups. It cuts funding towards the bureaus of the FBI and the ATF that are supporting local jurisdictions like Baltimore. That it doesn't do anything about things like ghost guns and these extended Glock clips that allow these Glocks to essentially turn into automatic weapons. Those are actually real, tangible things that the President of the United States could do and where you could put capital to actually make our communities safer.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you are a Democrat who is- President Trump says so as well, possibly a presidential candidate. He talked about you the other day.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He spent a lot of time talking about you.",
      "GOV. MOORE: I've been on his mind a lot of times.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You're spending time talking about crime. Is this something that, as a Democrat, you think the Democratic Party needs to be more vocal and muscular about when running for office? Because I hear you doing that. It's a very big change from 2020 when the you know idea was defund the police.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. And yet the President spending all of his time talking about me. I'm spending my time talking about the people I serve. And yes, I believe that we have to be able to address the issue of crime. I came up in, and I have existed in neighborhoods and communities that have been chronically neglected. And I remember one of the first things that happened in our first months in, I had to visit Shock Trauma inside of Baltimore, because Baltimore had one of the largest mass shootings in its history. And I visited a young man, a teenager, who was just finished surgery and had one of his testicles shot off, and was talking about, how was he ever going to become a father? And I said, at that point, I refuse to continue doing this and not putting the proper resources in place, and not being able to put a real focus on making our communities safer. And that's why it is so frustrating when we're hearing from the President of the United States something that is just purely performative, without actually focusing on these communities and these neighborhoods who believe that progress is possible and who are willing to put in the work and we're just simply asking for Washington to be able to acknowledge it and support it.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He says you're not 'presidential timber' at all. I imagine you disagree with that assessment?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah, I've been very clear. I'm not running for president--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right now.",
      "GOV. MOORE: But it's interesting that- but it's interesting the President seems to be more concerned about my future than he is about the future of the American people, and that's why I'm asking him to keep his focus. Focus on the things that actually matter right now, which is the fact that his economic policies are driving up prices on everything from electronics, to the clothes that we wear, to the food that we eat. Talk about the fact that he has immigration policies that are knocking out tens of thousands of jobs in the state of Maryland. Talk about the fact that you are about to kick veterans and seniors off of health care. Don't worry about my future. Worry about theirs.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you, you brought up immigration one of the residents of your state, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, was just released from pretrial detention on Friday. But the Trump administration has instructed him to report to ICE within 72 hours for deportation to Uganda. He's originally from El Salvador. He was mistakenly deported to that prison in El Salvador and then returned to the U.S. This is federal policy. This is not state policy. But I do wonder, is there anything that you are doing to help his family stay united?",
      "GOV. MOORE: And the- what we know is that- you know, and all we're asking for, is that the constitution be followed on this. The constitution is very clear about how we deal with these types of issues, and when we look at what's happened in this situation, it's the President manipulating the fact that we have a very broken immigration system inside this country. But instead of actually doing the work that it requires to fix it, actually working in Congress to come up with a comprehensive immigration bill, the President is using to just- working to exploit the brokenness. And I am very clear that there is no higher priority for me than public safety\u2013",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You want him to face a day in court, in other words.",
      "GOV. MOORE: Absolutely. I want due process. I just simply want a court and a judge to decide what is going to be the future fate of this case and all cases like this, and not simply the President of the United States or the Secretary of Homeland Security who is trying to be judge, Juror, prosecutor and executioner inside this case. I believe in the Constitution, and I believe that that's what we should follow for this case.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about something your party is tinkering with here, redistricting or gerrymandering, as some people know it. You've said you don't like talking about it, but all options are on the table when it comes to your state. There's only one- one seat here that is actually Republican, and it's a seat held by Representative Andy Harris. Are you considering trying to redraw lines in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah. When I say all options are on the table, all options are on the table.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Are you actively looking at it now?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yeah because and I think- and I think we have to--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: You are?",
      "GOV. MOORE: Yes, and I think- and I think we have to, because I think what's happened is this is what people hate about politics in the first place, the fact that the President of the United States very similar to what he did in Georgia, where he called up a series of voter registrants and said, I need you to find me more votes. We're watching the same thing now, where he's calling up legislatures around the country and saying, I need you to find me more congressional districts.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: He's doing it. That may be different, but Democrats redistrict you know this, Gavin Newsom is doing it right now. A few years ago in New York, we saw this. This can backfire. Do you really want to go down this road?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I want to make sure that we have fair lines and fair seats, where we don't have situations where- where politicians are choosing voters, but that voters actually have a chance to choose their elected officials. We need to be able to have fair maps. And we also need to make sure that if the President of the United States is putting his finger on the scale to try to manipulate elections, because he knows that his policies cannot win in a ballot box, then it behooves each and every one of us to be able to keep all options on the table to ensure that the voters voices can actually be heard, and we can have maps.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you don't think that one district where they represent- they have a Republican representative that they are actively being represented in Maryland?",
      "GOV. MOORE: I think if you look at maps across the country, less than 10% of congressional seats are actually competitive by nature. Less than 10%. And so if you look at the average win margin in our state and so many states, the average win margin is upwards of 20 to 30% so that means we already have so many gerrymandered areas that we have to be able to add a measure of fairness in the way that it's applied. And so yes, all options need to be on the table in the state of Maryland.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: And you're looking at it, you said.",

      "Israeli forces killed four aid seekers traveling on Sunday through a military zone south of Gaza City \u2014 an area regularly used by Palestinians trying to reach a food distribution point, a hospital and witnesses said.",
      "The deaths add to the growing toll of Palestinians killed while seeking food, as parts of the Gaza Strip plunge into famine and Israel's military ramps up activity in northern Gaza ahead of a planned offensive to seize its largest city.",
      "A U.N.-backed initiative on Friday declared a famine in Gaza City and warned that it is likely to spread without a ceasefire or an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid. Israel has disputed the assessment, saying \"there is no famine in Gaza.\"",
      "Al-Awda Hospital and two eyewitnesses told The Associated Press that the four Palestinians were killed when troops opened fire on a crowd heading to a site run by the Israeli-backed American contractor Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, or GHF, in the Netzarim corridor area. It occurred hundreds of meters (yards) away from the site, the eyewitnesses said.",
      "\"The gunfire was indiscriminate,\" Mohamed Abed, a father of two from the Bureij refugee camp, said, adding that while many fled some people fell to the ground after being shot.",
      "Abed and Aymed Sayyad, another aid seeker among the crowd, said troops opened fire when a group near the front of the crowd pushed forward toward a distribution site before its scheduled opening.",
      "Sayyad said he and others helped two people who were wounded by gunshots, one in his shoulder and in his leg.",
      "The Israeli military and GHF did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Since the GHF first began operating nearly three months ago, the U.N. says hundreds of Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israel Defense Forces and foreign military contractors at or near its aid sites.",
      "Malnutrition-related deaths",
      "The four deaths are the latest in areas where U.N. convoys have been overwhelmed by looters and desperate crowds, and where people have been shot and killed while heading to sites run by the GHF.",
      "More than 2,000 Palestinians have been killed and more than 13,500 wounded while seeking aid at distribution points or along convoy routes used by the United Nations and other aid groups, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry.",
      "The ministry said on Sunday that at least 62,686 Palestinians have been killed in the war, including missing people now confirmed dead by a special ministry judicial committee.",
      "It said the number of malnutrition-related deaths rose by eight to 289 on Sunday. The deaths include a child, bringing the death toll among children to 115 since the war between Israel and Hamas began in 2023.",
      "The health ministry does not say how many of those killed have been fighters or civilians but says around half have been women and children. It is part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals. The U.N. and independent experts consider it the most reliable source on war casualties. Israel disputes its figures but has not provided its own.",
      "The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 the world's leading authority on food crises \u2014 said Friday that famine is happening in Gaza City, home to hundreds of thousands of Palestinians, and could spread south to Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis by the end of next month.",
      "Aid groups have long warned that the war and months of Israeli restrictions on food and medical supplies entering Gaza are causing starvation. Israel has denied the existence of widespread hunger in Gaza, calling reports of starvation \"lies\" promoted by Hamas.",
      "\"Non-stop explosions\"",
      "In Jabaliya, the densely populated refugee camp just north of Gaza City, residents said they endured heavy explosions overnight. Days after Israel's military announced it was intensifying its operations in the area and mobilizing tens of thousands of reservists to take the city, they said they were living in constant fear.",
      "In the part of Gaza City where he and his family have sheltered since being displaced from a neighborhood on the city's southern edge, Ossama Matter said he had seen houses reduced to rubble and neighborhoods razed beyond recognition.",
      "\"They want it like Rafah,\" he said, referring to a town in southern Gaza destroyed earlier in the war. \"There have been non-stop explosions and strikes in the past days.\"",
      "While fleeing westward from Jabaliya, schoolteacher Salim Dhaher said he saw weaponized robots planting explosives as troops advanced from the opposite direction. As they set the stage for Israel's push to seize the city, Dhaher said he feared it was part of a larger effort to forcibly remove Palestinians from the north.",
      "The aim is clear, he said: \"To destroy everything above the ground, and force the transfer.\"",
      "There has been little sign of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians evacuating south ahead of Israel's invasion of Gaza City, which Israel says is still a Hamas stronghold. Many are exhausted by repeated displacements and unconvinced that any area\u2014 including so-called humanitarian zones \u2014 offers safety.",
      "The military operation could begin within days in a region that threatens the lives of hundreds of thousands of civilians, who are sheltering above an area Israel has invaded multiple times but still believes harbors a network of militant tunnels underground.",
      "Hamas-led militants abducted 251 people and killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the war. Most of the hostages have been released in ceasefires or other deals but 50 remain inside Gaza, around 20 of them believed by Israel to be alive."

    "summary": "A July 20 memo ordered U.S. intelligence agencies not to share information about Russia-Ukraine talks with Five Eyes partners U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 As Russia's war in Ukraine rages on despite high-level meetings to discuss a possible path to peace, CBS News has learned that Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, issued a directive weeks ago to the U.S. intelligence community ordering that all information regarding the Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations not be shared with U.S.-allied intelligence partners.",
      "The memo, dated July 20 and signed by Gabbard, directed agencies to not share information with the so-called Five Eyes, the post-World War II intelligence alliance comprising the U.S., U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand, multiple U.S. intelligence officials told CBS News. They spoke under condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The officials said the directive classified all analysis and information related to the volatile Russia-Ukraine peace negotiations as \"NOFORN,\" or no foreign dissemination, meaning the information could not be shared with any other country or foreign nationals. The only information that could be shared was information that had already been publicly released. The memo also limited distribution of material regarding peace talks to within the agencies that created or originated the intelligence.",
      "The memo does not seem to prevent the sharing of diplomatic information gathered by other means separate from the U.S. intelligence community, or military operational information unrelated to the talks \u2014 such as the details the U.S. shares with the Ukrainian military to aid in their defensive operations.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence referred questions to the White House, which did not respond.",
      "A day after CBS News published its report, DNI spokesperson Olivia Coleman said in a post on X that the reporting was false and said, \"U.S. intelligence sharing relationships with our allies have never been stronger.\"",
      "\"In general, the value of the Fives Eyes intelligence partnership is that when we are making and they are making policy decisions, we can both augment each other's intelligence and therefore know more about the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our adversaries,\" explained Steven Cash, a former intelligence officer at the Central Intelligence Agency and Department of Homeland Security.",
      "\"Among the reasons for that sort of default is the expectation that we and the other four are all sitting on the same side of the table with some other adversary on the other side,\" Cash said.",
      "He said it's important for the allies to have \"a common intelligence picture\" so policymakers and negotiators \"can coordinate our positions and get the best deal we can, or fight the best war we can.\" Cash is the executive director of The Steady State, a nonprofit organization made up of former U.S. intelligence and national security professionals and government officials concerned with threats to American democracy.",
      "In March 1946, Winston Churchill spoke of the \"special relationship\" between the U.S. and the U.K. and the threat of the \"Iron Curtain\" that had \"descended across the Continent.\" The United States and Britain first forged their intelligence alliance in secret, signing an agreement to pool information as a bulwark against the Soviet Union.",
      "Later, Canada, Australia and New Zealand joined the arrangement, transforming what began as a bilateral pact into the five-nation network that would come to be known as the Five Eyes.",
      "But now, nearly 80 years later, some former U.S. government officials warn that the breadth of Gabbard's order could undermine the intelligence community alliance \u2014 discouraging analysts from sharing insights and eroding trust among allies who have long relied on open exchanges to form a common picture of global threats and paths to successful negotiation.",
      "Cash and CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, a former homeland security official, said Five Eyes often has intelligence that helps the U.S. produce comprehensive intelligence assessments, especially about Russia, given the access Five Eyes partners have to other intelligence sources.",
      "\"Shutting our most trusted partners off from intelligence assessments could have a chilling effect on critical intelligence sharing if our partners believe they're being shut out of key access \u2014 including on key matters in their region. They could decide to take similar steps toward the U.S.,\" Vinograd said.",
      "She added, \"Policy-wise, if our Five Eyes partners think they are being shut off from key information. They could choose to create new structures and channels without us. A lack of full collaboration with our closest partners could lead them to discuss matters impacting our national security without our input and perspective.\"",
      "Still, other former intelligence officers contend Gabbard's directive is commonplace within the U.S. intelligence community, and the criticism is much ado about nothing. They say both the U.S. and the other members of the intelligence alliance frequently withhold information from each other in diverging interest areas. Ezra Cohen, a Hudson Institute fellow who served as the acting undersecretary of defense for intelligence at the Pentagon, suggested that condemnation of Gabbard's memo likely stems from a dislike of Trump administration policies and her leadership as director of national intelligence.",
      "\"There is a lot of information we do not share even with our Five Eyes partners, and it works in the reverse. There's a lot of U.K. eyes-only material. There's a lot of Australian eyes-only material,\" said Cohen.",
      "\"Our interests are not always aligned with our Five Eyes partners,\" Cohen said. \"And where we have diverging interests, and it's not just Ukraine, we absolutely mark things NOFORN.\"",
      "He admits it's possible the directive could result in depriving the U.S. of information, but maintains these types of decisions have historically been the norm between all of the Five Eyes members. He said the claim that the directive represents \"a chilling of the relationship\" between the U.S. and Five Eyes seems \"a little bit like faux outrage.\"",
      "As intelligence work and diplomatic efforts continue, largely out of the public eye, the war in Ukraine continues to take a deadly toll. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Moscow Thursday for launching hundreds of drones and dozens of missiles in an attack overnight, \"as if nothing had changed at all. As if there were no efforts by the world to stop this war.\"",

    "summary": "Erin, the first hurricane to develop over the Atlantic this year, became post-tropical on Friday afternoon, the National Hurricane Center said.",
    "story": [
      "Erin, now a post-tropical cyclone, continued moving away from the northeastern U.S. coast on Friday, but swimming at many East Coast beaches \"is likely to remain dangerous through the weekend,\" the National Hurricane Center in Miami said.",
      "Erin became post-tropical on Friday afternoon as it reached cooler waters. It's expected to remain a \"large and powerful hurricane-force low-pressure system through the weekend,\" the center said.",
      "What category is Erin?",
      "Erin, the first Atlantic hurricane of 2025, is now a post-tropical cyclone. It was a\u00a0Category 1\u00a0hurricane earlier Friday as it churned over the Atlantic off the central East Coast. It\u00a0exploded to a Category 5 on Saturday\u00a0before being downgraded and its strength fluctuated in recent days.",
      "The storm had maximum sustained winds of 90 mph and was heading east-northeast at 33 mph, according to a 5 p.m. ET Friday advisory from the National Hurricane Center, which noted that it would be the last advisory on Erin. The storm's center at that point was about 375 miles south-southwest of Halifax, Canada, and it was moving out over the North Atlantic.",
      "Maps show Hurricane Erin's forecast path",
      "Erin was forecast to pass south of Atlantic Canada into Friday night and then \"race across the north Atlantic waters\" in the coming days, the hurricane center said. There are no coastal watches or warnings in effect.",
      "Erin is likely to remain a large and powerful system, with hurricane-force winds extending outward up to 125 miles from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extending outward up to 435 miles, forecasters said Friday.",
      "Hurricane Erin's \"spaghetti models\"",
      "A \"spaghetti map\" of forecast models showed the storm skirting the Caribbean islands in its early days and remaining well off the U.S. East Coast as it moved north and curved back over the Atlantic. It's expected to end up \"stalling or meandering just south of Iceland\" by next week.",
      "Hurricane Erin's effects on the U.S.",
      "Though Erin was hurrying away from the U.S. East Coast on Friday, increased waves and rough surf are expected to continue from the mid-Atlantic up into New England into the weekend.",
      "The hurricane center warned of rough ocean conditions and \"life-threatening surf and rip currents\" along much of the Eastern Seaboard for the next several days.",
      "Erin brought tropical storm conditions to parts of North Carolina's Outer Banks on Thursday. Evacuations were ordered for\u00a0Hatteras Island\u00a0and\u00a0Ocracoke Island\u00a0in the Outer Banks ahead of the high waves and expected flooding. The dangerous conditions resulted in dozens of people being rescued this week in Wrightsville Beach. Erin also caused coastal flooding in Virginia, CBS Richmond affiliate WTKR-TV reported.",
      "Farther up the coast,\u00a0the New York City borough of Queens, as well as Long Island, had some flooding. At beaches in the area and along the\u00a0Jersey shore, swimming was prohibited due to the high surf and rip currents. Big waves and whipping winds are also bringing dangerous beach conditions to the Massachusetts coast, CBS News Boston reported.",
      "Rip currents a potentially deadly threat",
      "Rip currents\u00a0are narrow channels of fast-moving water that commonly occur along U.S. coastlines and can pull even strong swimmers away from shore. They're the reason for\u00a0more than 80%\u00a0of beach rescues.",
      "Many beaches from South Florida up to New England\u00a0took precautions and closed to swimmers.",
      "First hurricane of the Atlantic season",
      "Erin formed as a tropical storm\u00a0on Aug. 11 west of the island nation of Cabo Verde, a few hundred miles off Africa's western coast. It is the fifth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, which started in June and runs through November. Erin strengthened to a hurricane on Friday.",
      "So far this year, Tropical Storm Chantal is the only one to have made landfall in the U.S., bringing deadly flooding to North Carolina in early July. In June, Barry made landfall as a tropical depression on Mexico's eastern coast.",
      "Erin's increased strength comes as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak in September. According to the hurricane center, most of the season's activity typically happens between mid-August and mid-October. In the eastern Pacific Ocean, hurricane season starts on May 15 with a peak in activity typically seen in late August.",
      "The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, forecast an above-normal season for the Atlantic this year, expecting between 13 and 18 named storms.",
      "Tropical storms have maximum sustained winds of at least 39 mph. Forecasters with NOAA anticipated that between five and nine of the storms this year could become hurricanes, which have sustained winds of at least 74 mph. Hurricanes are rated on a scale based on their wind speeds, ranging from Category 1, the weakest, to Category 5, the most severe rating.",
      "NOAA forecasters predicted there could be between two and five major hurricanes in the Atlantic this season.",

      "The relics date back over 2,000 years. Egyptian authorities said the site, located in the waters of Abu Qir Bay near Alexandria, may be an extension of the ancient city of Canopus, a prominent center during the Ptolemaic dynasty, which ruled Egypt for nearly 300 years, and the Roman Empire, which governed for around 600 years.",

    "story": [
      "The Gaza Strip's largest city is now gripped by famine, according to the world's leading authority on food crises. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, said Friday that famine was occurring in Gaza City and that this was likely to spread to the southern cities of Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah without a ceasefire and an end to restrictions on humanitarian aid.",
      "Aid groups and food security experts have warned for months that Gaza was on the brink of famine, but the IPC report is the first official declaration that the situation has reached this level. Israel immediately rejected the IPC's assessment, with the foreign ministry repeating bluntly a claim it has made for months, that \"there is no famine in Gaza.\"",
      "But the IPC \u2014 which is comprised of more than a dozen U.N. agencies, aid groups, governments and other bodies and was first set up in 2004 during the famine in Somalia \u2014 said it had concluded based on \"reasonable evidence\" that famine \"is confirmed in Gaza Governorate.\"",
      "\"After 22 months of relentless conflict, over half a million people in the Gaza Strip are facing catastrophic conditions characterized by starvation, destitution and death,\" the group said, warning that 1.07 million more people in Gaza were currently in a slightly lower starvation risk category, and that the circumstances were likely to expand within the densely populated Palestinian territory.",

Nearly a third of the population (641,000 people) are expected to face catastrophic conditions (IPC Phase 5), while those in Emergency (IPC Phase 4) will likely rise to 1.14 million (58 percent). Acute malnutrition is projected to continue worsening rapidly.\"",
      "The IPC said for the next year at least, \"at least 132,000 children under five are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition \u2014 double the IPC estimates from May 2025. This includes over 41,000 severe cases of children at heightened risk of death.\"",
      "In a separate statement, Tom Fletcher, who heads the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said Israel's \"systematic obstruction\" of aid had caused the famine in Gaza.",
      "\"It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,\" Fletcher told reporters in Geneva, calling it \"a famine that will and must haunt us all.\"",
      "Israel insists \"there is no famine in Gaza\"",
      "In a statement, the Israeli foreign ministry categorically rejected the findings of the UN-backed report.",
      "\"There is no famine in Gaza,\" the ministry said, accusing the IPC of presenting a report \"based on Hamas lies laundered through organizations with vested interests.\"",
      "\"Over 100,000 trucks of aid have entered Gaza since the start of the war, and in recent weeks a massive influx of aid has flooded the Strip with staple foods and caused a sharp decline in food prices, which have plummeted in the markets,\" the ministry said.",
      "While more humanitarian aid has been allowed into Gaza in recent weeks, as Israel has come under intense international pressure, aid organizations say it is nowhere near the amount required. A controversial new U.S.- and Israeli-backed aid distribution group has also come under sharp criticism over the killing of numerous civilians near its four distribution hubs in Gaza.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lashed out at the IPC report Friday, dismissing it as \"an outright lie.\"",
      "\"Israel does not have a policy of starvation. Israel has a policy of preventing starvation,\" Netanyahu said, repeating the foreign ministry's figures on food aid provided since the war began and the more recent influx.",
      "In a social media post, U.S. Ambassador Mike Huckabee backed Netanyahu's assertion, insisting that \"tons of food has gone into Gaza but Hamas savages stole it, ate lots of it to become corpulent, sold it on black market but they didn't give it to the hostages.\"",
      "What does a famine classification mean?",
      "Famine can appear in pockets, sometimes small ones, and so a formal classification requires caution, food security experts say. The IPC has only confirmed famine a few times \u2014 in Somalia in 2011, and South Sudan in 2017 and 2020, and last year in parts of Sudan's western Darfur region.

Since GHF started operating aid sites in May, CBS News has reported on near-daily shootings at or near GHF sites, and former U.S. security contractors have spoken out about witnessing gunfire against Palestinian crowds in interviews with news outlets, including The Associated Press.",

      "The new framework, which is an agreement to facilitate trade negotiations between countries rather than a finalized deal, comes after President Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen met briefly in July at Mr. Trump's Turnberry golf course in Scotland. At the time, they announced a sweeping trade deal that imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods, warding off the Mr. Trump's threat of a 30% rate if no deal was reached by Aug. 1.",
      "In the latest pact, the U.S. reaffirmed its pledge to limit import duties on most European goods, including cars, drugs and semiconductors to no more than 15%, pending additional legislative actions by the EU.",

      "\"This Framework Agreement represents a concrete demonstration of our commitment to fair, balanced, and mutually beneficial trade and investment,\" the White House and EU said in a joint statement. \"This Framework Agreement will put our trade and investment relationship \u2013 one of the largest in the world \u2013 on a solid footing and will reinvigorate our economies' reindustrialization.\"",
      "After the agreement is fully implemented, the average effective U.S. tariff on imports from EU countries will range from 10% to 14%, according to Eurasia Group, a consulting firm focused on political risk. Together, the U.S. and the EU account for 44% of the global economy.",
      "What's inside the framework pact",
      "The framework impacts a broad range of items produced by the U.S. and the EU, ranging from dairy products to lobster. Some of the additional provisions include:",
      "The EU will \"provide preferential market access\" for U.S. agricultural goods and seafood, including dairy products, fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, soybean oil and pork and bison meat.\u00a0The EU pledged to take steps to extend a 2020 agreement for lobster imports, which had expired in July, including expanding the scope to include processed lobster.The U.S. will reduce tariffs on EU-made automobiles to 15% once the European trading bloc formalizes its elimination of tariffs on all American industrial exports.\u00a0A pledge by the EU to buy at least $40 billion's worth of U.S. AI chips for its computing centers.The EU said it would \"substantially increase procurement of military and defense equipment from the United States, with the support and facilitation of the U.S. government,\" although the framework didn't include a dollar figure for the purchases.The EU and U.S. agreed to streamline requirements for sanitary certificates for pork and dairy products, part of an effort to address nontariff barriers to trade.",

      "There have been a total of 6,212 words added, the dictionary said. A number of them have been linked to celebrities or public officials, and others have been popularized by Gen Z and Gen Alpha.",

      "\"I was doing a segment for SiriusXM for his channel, the Billy Joel channel on Sirius a couple of weeks ago,\" she said. \"I do a playlist of his songs. I do analysis on it with the backstories. So I interview him. I go straight to the source, my dad, and I ask him about all the material. And I was asking him, single by single, I said, \u2018Well, which album is this from? What year?\u2019\"",
      "\"He remembers every album, the exact year, the order in which the singles were ordered on the album,\" she added. \"So, as far as I'm concerned, he's sharp as a tack.

      "Alexa recently released her new single \"Riverside Way.\" (Alexa Ray Joel)",
      "\"It is personal to me because it was my way of saying to the world and saying, as an artist, I'm not just one person,\" she said. \"I think there is a sort of societal penchant and interest in putting women in a box and pinpointing them as, 'OK, she's that type.'\"",
      "Alexa continued, \"She's good or she is bad or she's sugar or she's spice or she's sweet or she's a bitch. We have this interest in pigeonholing women a lot of times. Or even people do it [and] they don't even realize, right? You just form quick judgments based on a picture or based on an interview clip, now with sound bites on social media. It's so easy to form judgments too quickly, I feel.\"",
      "\"And so \u2018Riverside Way\u2019 is personal for me because it's my way of saying, 'Hey, you know, just like most women and particularly artists, there's not just one side to us,'\" she added. \"There is the side of me that's very much the good daughter and loves to perhaps be a little more demure. But then there's another side that's...a bit wilder and more curious and more interested in exploring things. And I think with \u2018Riverside Way,\u2019 I wanted to show, it's OK to get outside your comfort zone and take risks, both with storytelling, narrative wise and stylistically with this song.\"",
      "\"I wanted this image of a girl that's just having a fantasy with a guy and, you know, speeding down the highway in a truck at 200 miles per hour, and they're not even sure where they're going or where they'll end up because they're so immersed in the moment. And so I wanted that escapism to be very vivid. And I am an escapist at heart. I love painting a very vivid picture in my mind. That I can just sort of climb into and crawl into. I get a real thrill from that as an artist.\"",

      "Anti-woke crusader Robby Starbuck released a devastating video takedown of Cracker Barrel's leadership, making the case that the restaurant's logo and decor change are the culmination of a years-long campaign to cater to the far Left and abandon the values of its middle-America customer base.",
      "Starbuck, who has brought major companies including John Deere, Target, and Harley-Davidson to heel by exposing their woke policies, described Cracker Barrel\u2019s logo makeover as going from \"old American nostalgia\" to something \"cold, dead, lifeless and modern\" in a 15-minute video. He said that, while the Cracker Barrel brand is often associated with American tradition, the company is \"infested with left-wing activists who are more interested in safe spaces, pronouns and virtue signaling than they are in their customers.\"",

Rocking chairs are practically synonymous with Cracker Barrel, with the restaurant\u2019s long porches lined with them at locations nationwide.",
      "\"The fact that it's located there is important to this story because what's happened here is a microcosm of the parasitic operating procedure of left-wing activists,\" Starbuck said. \"They don't just wanna force their soulless, godless, hedonistic vision of the future onto blue hellscapes that their party controls.",
      "\"No, it's much more important to them that they shove it down into your towns, into your kids' schools and into your way of life. So, sticking a pro-trans rocking chair into their headquarters in a predominantly conservative town is exactly the type of thing they revel in doing.\"",
      "Starbuck then pointed to the company\u2019s involvement with HRC and participation in the Out and Equal Workplace Summit. For the Out and Equal conference, Cracker Barrel made rocking chairs in every color of the rainbow, representing the LGBTQ+ flag. Out and Equal even gave Cracker Barrel an award for having 2018\u2019s top LGBTQ+ Employee Resource Group (ERG).",

      "Your email address may have ended up in the hands of scammers through several common methods. The most likely cause is a data breach. Many well-known companies have\u00a0experienced leaks in which customer emails and other information were exposed.",
      "Once your email is part of a leaked database, it often circulates on the dark web or in underground forums, where it is freely traded and reused. Even if you were not part of a breach, scammers often use a technique called credential stuffing. This involves testing stolen login details across different websites to confirm which email addresses are active.",
      "REMOVE YOUR DATA TO PROTECT YOUR RETIREMENT FROM SCAMMERS",
      "The best thing you can do to prevent this from happening is to invest in a data removal service. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.",

      "7 ways to secure your email from scammers",
      "These simple but powerful steps can help you protect your inbox, safeguard your identity and stay one step ahead of scammers misusing your email.",
      "Start by locking down your email account with a strong, unique password that you don\u2019t reuse anywhere else. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) so hackers can\u2019t get in even if they\u2019ve stolen your password. A password manager makes this much easier by generating and securely storing complex passwords, helping you avoid the risks of reuse.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see\u00a0Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Scan your inbox regularly for order confirmations, shipping notices or account sign-ups you don't recognize. If something looks off, report it directly to the retailer or platform; it could be part of a larger scam using your email address. Never click on suspicious links, even if the message looks legitimate, and protect your devices with strong antivirus software to catch threats before they spread.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Avoid entering your email on shady giveaway sites or sketchy online forms. When in doubt, skip the sign-up or use a throwaway email. The fewer places your email lives, the harder it is for scammers to get hold of it.",
      "Set up a dedicated email for online purchases, newsletters and subscriptions. This helps keep your main inbox clean and makes it easier to spot strange activity. Sometimes, it's best to create various email aliases so that you don't have to worry about all your info getting taken in a data breach.\u00a0 An email alias address is a great way for you to stop receiving constant spam mail by simply deleting the email alias address. These aliases forward messages to your primary address, making it easier to manage incoming communications and avoid data breaches.",

      "If this email misuse leads to fraudulent financial activity, users should file a report with the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov or their local authorities.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "If you are receiving order confirmations for things you never bought, do not shrug it off. Your email is likely being misused as part of a larger fraud operation, not by accident but intentionally. Scammers are taking advantage of active, trustworthy email addresses to slip past retailer defenses and carry out unauthorized purchases. The repeated use of your email shows that fraud networks are already circulating it, even if your financial information remains untouched.",

      "Surgeries may become safer and more precise than ever before.",
      "A new brain implant now lets people control Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones and the Vision Pro, using only their thoughts. Synchron, an endovascular brain-computer interface (BCI) company based in New York, demonstrated the first wireless BCI that works with Apple's official protocol.",
      "Ten patients have received the implant: six in the U.S. and four in Australia. With this technology, users living with severe paralysis can navigate apps, send messages and operate devices hands-free. This breakthrough greatly expands independence, as it enables patients to manage their environment, stream shows and control smart home devices, all using only their minds.",
      "Synchron's advancement in BCI technology marks a significant step for assistive devices and hints at how we may interact with computers in the future. The device's hands-free, voice-free operation offers a powerful new level of accessibility and autonomy for people with disabilities.",

      "ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface (BCI) working with an iPad. (Synchron)",
      "A first for brain-tech and Apple",
      "Synchron is the first company to connect a brain implant directly to Apple devices using Apple's official BCI Human Interface Device (HID) protocol. This means no custom hacks or workarounds. The system simply connects over Bluetooth, just like a keyboard or a mouse, and works with iPhones, iPads, and even the Apple Vision Pro. In a powerful video shared by Synchron, ALS patient Mark Jackson demonstrates the tech in action. After losing the use of his hands, he's now able to navigate his iPad entirely with thought. That includes opening apps, composing messages, and staying connected with the people he loves-all without moving a muscle.",
      "Behind the scenes, Synchron's system uses artificial intelligence to decode brain signals and turn them into real-time digital commands. Machine learning models interpret motor intent, such as thinking about tapping your finger, and translate that into actions on the iPad. This AI-powered decoding helps the system feel smooth and responsive as users learn to control it with focus alone.",
      "Synchron's brain-computer interface is seen up close. (Synchron)",
      "The game-changing signal strength meter",
      "One surprising new feature is the built-in signal strength meter. This visual cue shows patients how strong their brain signal is in real time. A blue box appears over an icon or app and fills up based on how clearly the system reads the user's intent. It may sound simple, but this is a huge deal. It helps users like Mark fine-tune their mental focus, adjust their posture, and improve their interaction without outside help. It's like seeing your brain in action and learning to drive it better.\u00a0\"When I lost the use of my hands, I thought I had lost my independence,\" Mark says in the video.\u00a0\"Now, with my iPad, I can message my loved ones, read the news, and stay connected with the world, just by thinking.\"",

      "Mark Jackson operates Synchron\u2019s brain-computer interface, which functions using Apple's official protocol. (Synchron)",
      "What sets Synchron apart",
      "BCIs like Synchron's Stentrode and Elon Musk's\u00a0Neuralink have connected to devices before, but never like this. Previous setups required custom software or physical adapters. Now, thanks to Apple's new BCI HID protocol, brain-computer interfaces can plug right into the Apple ecosystem like any other accessory. That official integration opens the door to more features, better performance, and fewer setup hurdles. Synchron's COO, Kurt Haggstrom, calls it a\u00a0\"game changer\" for both patients and the entire BCI industry.",
      "What this means for you",
      "This tech isn't just for people with paralysis, at least, not forever. Today, it's a medical tool undergoing trials. Tomorrow, it could become a consumer product you buy at your local Apple Store. With Apple embracing BCI as a legitimate input method, everything from your phone to your smart home could one day be controllable by thought. That opens the door for more accessibility, more customization, and completely new ways of interacting with technology.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Synchron's Apple demo marks a new era in brain-computer interaction. It turns thoughts into action using mainstream tech you probably already own. While it's still in its early stages, the direction is clear: BCI is moving out of the lab and into real life, and Apple is helping lead the charge.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy reports on President Donald Trump brokering a deal with Azerbaijan and Armenia on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s new deal in the South Caucasus has ended a decades-long conflict and handed Washington a rare strategic foothold on Iran\u2019s northern border, experts say.",
      "The agreement, signed earlier this month between Armenia and Azerbaijan, grants the U.S. a 99-year lease over the Zangezur Corridor - a narrow strip of land that will serve as a critical trade and energy route to Europe, bypassing Tehran entirely. Iranian American journalist and dissident Banafsheh Zand told Fox News Digital the move is \"a wonderful gain for the U.S.\" that also delivers a \"slap in the face\" to the regime in Tehran.",
      "The corridor has long been at the center of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, which displaced tens of thousands and fueled three decades of instability. Trump\u2019s intervention brought both sides to the table and created what observers say is a new trade and security lifeline linking the Caspian Basin to Europe, bypassing Iran entirely.",
      "ARMENIA AND AZERBAIJAN LEADERS SEEK TO EASE RUSSIAN AND IRANIAN CONCERNS AFTER US-BROKERED PEACE DEAL",
      "A view from Armenia's southern border reveals the Arax River, with Iran visible across the water. This crossing is a vital lifeline for Armenia, facilitating essential trade and energy flows, especially as tensions rise over the proposed Zangezur Corridor. Iran strongly opposes the corridor, fearing it would sever its direct land access to Armenia and diminish its role as a regional transit hub. The corridor, intended to connect Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave through Armenian territory, has become a flashpoint in regional geopolitics. (Anthony Pizzoferrato/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "Known as the Trump Route for Peace & Prosperity (TRIPP), economically, the agreement secures Washington a direct role in overseeing the flow of Caspian hydrocarbons to Europe. The U.S. will manage rail and road infrastructure, telecom networks and energy pipelines running through the corridor, giving American companies a dominant position in regional transit for oil, gas and goods. By controlling this artery, the U.S. not only generates billions in future trade and investment but also locks Europe into alternative supply routes that reduce reliance on both Russia and Iran.",
      "For allies, the corridor offers cheaper and safer access to Caspian energy. For Tehran, it represents lost revenue, lost leverage, and the end of its ability to act as a mandatory gatekeeper for east-west commerce.",
      "Zand said the deal is not only historic but also a direct win for Washington. \"It\u2019s a wonderful gain for the U.S.,\" she said. \"American contractors will be supervising oil and gas from the Caspian Basin, routed through Zangezur and Turkey to Europe. The profit margins are great, and it all happens under NATO\u2019s blessing.\"",
      "Zand said the potential goes even further. \"Nobody\u2019s talking about it yet, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s out of the question to see U.S. bases there,\" she said. \"If that happens, then checkmate the Khamenei regime and Russia.\"",

US President Donald Trump said Friday that Armenia and Azerbaijan were committed to a permanent peace as he hosted a White House summit with the leaders of the two South Caucasus nations, which have fought for decades. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "For Iran, the corridor represents what Zand called a nightmare scenario. Tehran has long used its geography to shape energy and trade flows. By inserting the U.S. into the region, the new deal effectively strips Iran of that leverage. Zand put it in stark terms: \"Iran is shaped like a cat, a sitting cat. This corridor literally runs above the cat\u2019s ears. It bypasses Iran, takes money away from the regime, and pushes them out into the cold.\"",
      "Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior director of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Iran Program, said the corridor exposes how vulnerable Iran has become in the Caucasus. \"Both the defeat of Armenia in the most recent war with Azerbaijan, as well as the political problems between Moscow and Yerevan today, have made it harder for the Islamic Republic to really benefit from its traditional economic and political relationship with Armenia,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "An infographic titled \u2018Construction of roads and railways extending to the Zangezur Corridor continues without interruption.\u2019 Once constructed, the corridor will connect Azerbaijan's western provinces and Nakhchivan via Armenia, further stretching to China, Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey.\u00a0 (Yasin Demirci/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "\"They still do have ties, and the regime is an opportunistic actor as much as it is an ideological one. If there is any way to throw stones at this agreement, or extract concessions on the back end, they will try.\"",
      "At the same time, he said the strategic picture is clear. \"The Islamic Republic is, in essence, carved out of this route,\" he said. \"This is not just a critical corridor that could bring stability to the South Caucasus and economic improvement for all countries involved-it also drives home the point that the regime has been such a poor guardian of Iran\u2019s national interest that the Iranian state has been excluded from a major transit route just above its border.\"",
      "Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei addresses the media during voting for parliamentary elections in Tehran, Iran in May 2024. (Photo by Fatemeh Bahrami/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "The timing, Zand argued, makes the impact even greater. She pointed to Iran\u2019s weakening position since October 7, 2023, and Israel's recent 12-day war with Tehran. \"The regime was self-isolated when it couldn\u2019t come to Hamas\u2019s or Hezbollah\u2019s rescue. Iraq\u2019s Shiites are saying they don\u2019t want to be controlled, Syria is out, and Hezbollah has been degraded. For those of us who\u2019ve watched the regime for decades, we always knew it was a paper tiger. October 7 and the war exposed it to the world.\"",
      "The killing of senior IRGC commanders and nuclear scientists has deepened the sense of vulnerability inside Tehran. \"They can huff and puff about blowing the house down, but the truth is, there\u2019s a whole lot of fear among the regime\u2019s leaders now,\" Zand said. \"Khamenei has even gone into hiding again.\"",
      "TRUMP BRINGS PEACE TO CAUCASUS: INSIDE THE ARMENIA\u2013AZERBAIJAN DEAL 30 YEARS IN THE MAKING",
      "Ben Taleblu added that Washington is now using these shifts to turn Iran\u2019s weakness into opportunity. \"Wherever the regime is weak, that invites pushback, whether militarily or economically,\" he said. \"The U.S. has followed Israel\u2019s military success against the Islamic Republic with strikes of its own against nuclear facilities, and it is now following Azerbaijan\u2019s battlefield success with a political and economic success of its own. This corridor is another example of America moving in when Tehran is most vulnerable.\"",
      "An aerial view of the construction of roads and railways that will pass through the Zangezur Corridor, which will connect the western provinces with Nakhchivan and will also be one of the routes of the Central Corridor extending from China to Central Asia, the Caspian Sea, the Caucasus and Turkey. (Photo by Resul Rehimov/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Zand, whose father was a well-known Iranian journalist and intellectual assassinated by the regime, said she views Trump\u2019s direct involvement as the key to the corridor\u2019s success. \"Because it\u2019s Trump, it makes all the difference,\" she said. \u00a0\"Trump doesn\u2019t care about not hurting people\u2019s feelings. He responds to how people act. And with this move, he\u2019s sitting over Iran like a vulture-ominous, watching, ready.\"",
      "For dissidents like Zand, the corridor represents more than a transport route. \"We\u2019ve prayed for this for decades,\" she said. \"Until the regime is gone, people inside Iran will remain too afraid to rise up again. But this corridor is a boon. It shows the regime is surrounded, and its days are numbered.\"",

      "The deal was reached with NATO backing and has already been compared by some observers to historic peace accords. Zand believes the significance lies not only in ending a 30-year conflict but also in turning the U.S. presence in the Caucasus into a permanent reality. \"The regime knows the jig is up.\"",

      "The man on the passenger side opened the door and slammed his gun into Waller\u2019s right ear and scalp, knocking him out for a moment. When he came to, he was still strapped into his seat belt, blood flowing down the side of his head.",

      "They say that in their decades of work, they\u2019ve found that people often think they\u2019re doing a good job with their dental hygiene, but in fact it\u2019s quite subpar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of supervised neglect,\u201d Slot said. \u201cEverybody brushes their teeth, but you probably learned how from your parents, and in the end nobody really learns it right. In almost 100% of cases, there is room for improvement.\u201d",

      "Which kind of toothbrush is best?",
      "What about toothpaste?",
      "How long should you brush for?",
      "Does mouthwash really help fight cavities?",
      "Slot, a professor of preventive oral health, and Van der Weijden, a professor emeritus of periodontology, both at the Academic Centre for Dentistry in Amsterdam, decided to undertake this mammoth project after decades of getting peppered with home-care dental questions from patients, colleagues and friends. As scientists, they wanted to respond based on the body of published research, not just their own opinions and observations.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t have an answer,\u201d van der Weijden said.",
      "He does know that dental health is in a pretty bad state. In the U.S., about 40% of adults age 30 or older have gum disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 90% of us between 20 and 64 have had tooth decay, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Misinformation about fluoride",
      "\u201cOn social media, influencers are telling people to be fluoride-free and to do oil pulling where you swish your mouth with oil,\u201d Slot said. \u201cThey\u2019re not giving advice based on science.\u201d",
      "Best practices matter \u2014 especially if you live in a community or state in the U.S. that\u2019s considering banning fluoride in public drinking water, which could lead to an increase in dental problems.",
      "Tooth pain can be miserable",
      "In 2017, there were 2.1 million emergency room visits for dental emergencies, according to the CDC. That doesn\u2019t include visits to the dentist to get a cavity filled or a root canal \u2014 and having someone drill in your mouth is never fun.",
      "Bad teeth can be costly",
      "In 2021, Americans who had at least one dental visit that year spent an average of $887 on dental care, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The costs don\u2019t stop there: Almost $46 billion is lost in productivity in the U.S. each year because of untreated oral disease, according to the CDC.",
      "Third, your mouth is connected to the rest of your body. Gum disease has been associated with a number of health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes, according to the American Dental Association. A 2016 analysis of periodontal disease research found that gum disease may be linked to 57 chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular and liver diseases, as well as preterm births.",
      "Slot and van der Weijden said they need another three years or so to complete their magnum opus. In the meantime, they shared their recommended best practices for adult dental care, along with suggestions from two U.S. dental experts: Lancette VanGuilder, president of the American Dental Hygienists\u2019 Association, and Dr. Mia Geisinger, president of the American Academy of Periodontology.",
      "Use an electric toothbrush for two minutes",
      "The experts said you need pretty spectacular technique to make a traditional toothbrush work as effectively as an electric one. They suggested one with a timer, so you\u2019ll brush for the full two minutes. The American Dental Association recommends soft bristles, and the experts said the size and shape of the toothbrush head (rectangular or circle) depends on the size of your mouth and other personal factors.",
      "Use a pea-size amount of toothpaste",
      "More isn\u2019t better here, because excessive toothpaste might trick you.",
      "A mouth full of foam might hide the fact that your gums are bleeding, and that\u2019s an important warning sign you should notice and discuss with your dentist, VanGuilder said. Van der Weijden has another reason not to load up your brush.",
      "\u201cToothpastes have surfactants \u2014 a detergent \u2014 which makes your teeth feel smooth, so you have an almost immediate sensation that you\u2019ve cleaned your teeth when probably you haven\u2019t done a good job,\u201d he said.",
      "The American Dental Association recommends only toothpastes that contain fluoride.",
      "For teeth in the back, consider a second smaller brush",
      "If your toothbrush is too big to get to your back teeth, consider buying a child-sized brush to reach them, VanGuilder said. Also, closing your mouth a bit relaxes your jaw muscles and gives you more space back there.",
      "For between teeth, use tiny interdental brushes",
      "\u201cUsing floss appropriately is very difficult,\u201d said Slot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work well in everybody\u2019s hands.\u201d Several studies, including a 2018 review of 22 clinical trials, found that interdental brushes were better than floss or other tools at reducing gum inflammation. Some have rubber bristles and some have nylon bristles. Both are available in drug stores, and these tiny interdental brushes are meant to supplement a regular toothbrush, not replace it.",
      "Should you floss or brush first?",
      "Geisinger, the periodontist, recommends cleaning between your teeth first and then brushing \u2014 she says it\u2019s helpful to get the big pieces of gunk out so the brush can get in and do its work.",
      "If you prefer floss, the experts said it generally doesn\u2019t matter if you choose waxed or unwaxed \u2014 whichever you like best is fine.",
      "Yes, mouthwash is easy \u2014 but be careful",
      "\u201cMany people will pick mouthwash instead of cleaning in between your teeth, and cleaning in between your teeth is really much more beneficial,\u201d Geisinger said. If you do want to use mouthwash along with floss or interdental brushes, she warns that mouthwashes with alcohol can contribute to tooth decay for people with dry mouths."

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 An English-dubbed version of the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha II,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever, has been released in the United States, with a voice cast that includes Michelle Yeoh.",
      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",
      "She later received a call asking if she wanted to voice Lady Yin, Ne Zha\u2019s mother, for an English-dubbed version being distributed by A24. The New York-based independent film company is known for productions including \u201cMoonlight\u201d and \u201cEverything Everywhere All at Once,\u201d the 2022 film that made Yeoh the first Asian to win the Academy Award for best actress.",
      "\u201cHell yes,\u201d Yeoh said in response, calling the movie \u201ca beautiful way\u201d to cross the cultural bridge between East and West.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a universal language of family, of love, of the underdog, of someone who\u2019s ostracized, misunderstood just because you\u2019re born different,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "Since its release in mainland China in January, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d has become the world\u2019s fifth-highest-grossing movie of all time, just behind James Cameron\u2019s \u201cTitanic.\u201d In February, it surpassed Pixar\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d as the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film.",
      "It is also the first non-Hollywood film to exceed $2 billion in global earnings, most of which came from the Chinese box office.",
      "The movie \u2014 which is directed by Sichuan-born Yang Yu, also known as Jiaozi \u2014 has stoked national pride in China, with the state-run newspaper People\u2019s Daily praising its commercial success as the \u201cfruits of a confident nation.\u201d",
      "Many schools, state-owned companies and government entities across China have actively organized group viewings of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d in celebration of what they see as a milestone in Chinese animation.",
      "The success of \u201cNe Zha II\u201d is driven by both the maturation of China\u2019s animation industry and authorities\u2019 \u201cfull support\u201d for strengthening the country\u2019s soft power and cultural exports, said Zeng Hong, assistant professor at Hong Kong Baptist University\u2019s Academy of Film.",
      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "The obituary did not provide details on Adler\u2019s death. Adler\u2019s friend Frank J. Reilly confirmed his death in a post on X Saturday.",
      "\u201cYou know him from one of his iconic roles [and] from many of his guest appearances,\u201d Reilly wrote. \u201cNot bad for a guy who didn\u2019t start acting until he was 65.\u201d",
      "Adler came from a theater family, the son of Group Theatre manager Phil Adler and the nephew of actor Jacob Pavlovich Adler, he told the Southern New England Jewish Ledger in 2014.",
      "He was a theater veteran who worked behind the curtain on some of Broadway\u2019s biggest shows. Adler worked as stage manager for the original 1956 production of \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d featuring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison.",
      "He\u2019d later direct the revival in 1976 after having worked on shows like \u201cAnnie,\u201d \u201cMarlene Dietrich\u201d and \u201cWe Interrupt This Program...\u201d as a production supervisor and director.",
      "Adler wouldn\u2019t receive his first acting credit until 1991, when he appeared on an episode of \u201cBrooklyn Bridge.\u201d He appeared on popular television series such as \u201cQuantum Leap\u201d and \u201cLaw & Order,\u201d and even had some leading roles in shows like \u201cHudson Street.\u201d",
      "But the world will likely best remember Adler for his six seasons on the HBO series \u201cThe Sopranos.\u201d",
      "Hesh Rabkin, played by Adler, was a confident to lead character Tony Soprano, a troubled New Jersey mafia boss struggling with his work and his family.",
      "A recurring character, Rabkin was a loan shark who often doled out advice to the younger mafioso.",
      "\"Sopranos\" actor Michael Imperioli paid tribute to his former co-star on Instagram, describing Adler as a \"true class act\" and that he loved spending time with Adler.",
      "\"JERRY ADLER (1929-2025) was a fantastic actor and the kindest of human beings,\" Imperioli wrote. \"He brought so much humor, intelligence and truth to the role of Herman 'Hesh' Rabkin and was one of my favorite characters on The Sopranos.",
      "Adler made appearances in a number of other hit series, such as \u201cBroad City,\u201d \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d and \u201cTransparent.\u201d He was a recurring guest on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d a legal procedural led by Julianna Margulies.",
      "Robert King, co-creator of \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d recalled Adler\u2019s role on the show as Howard Lyman in a social media post Sunday. He described Adler as \u201cone of our favorite collaborators.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe intent was only to have him for one episode of THE GOOD WIFE, but he was so funny in a diner scene, yelling \u2018I said ice cream, you stupid b----\u2019 we had him back for six years of Good Wife and three years of Good Fight,\u201d King wrote.",
      "What was meant to be one episode turned into 30 for Adler, according to his IMDb page. He then appeared in two episodes of the show\u2019s spinoff \u201cThe Good Fight.\u201d",
      "People shared kind words about Adler in the comments of his online obituary, some who knew him personally sharing memories. One woman named Sharon Aiuvalasit wrote that she was able to go to the set of her favorite show, \"Santa Barbara\" because of a family friend who knew Adler.",
      "\"Jerry welcomed my mom, dad and little brother to the set for 12 hours and it continues to be one of the most magical memories of my life,\" Aiuvalasit wrote.",
      "A man named Jimmy Horton recalled that his very first job at 18 was working with Adler on the drama \"Search For Tomorrow.\" He worked on Broadway over the years and reunited with Adler in Larry David's 2015 play, \"Fish In The Dark.\"",
      "\"When rehearsals started I reintroduced myself and we reminisced about Search and the great people there and I got to see Jerry as an actor six nights a week for several months and he was a delight, a real mensch and a terrific actor to see up close,\" Horton wrote.",
      "Adler wrote a memoir released last year called \"Too Funny For Words,\" writing about moments like his first job working for his father as an assistant stage manager on \"Gentleman Prefer Blondes.\" He told CT Insider in an interview promoting his book that he had to lead Carol Channing by flashlight because she was \"terribly near-sighted.\"",
      "Asked about his career, Adler told the outlet that \"it's been a glorious run.\"",
      "\"I wrote this book during there pandemic because I thought the world could use some laughs,\" Adler said. \"I still have more stories to tell, too, about working on the Tony Awards shows, about all the summer stock productions, about all the \"My Fair Lady\" revivals.  Maybe there can be 'Too Funny For Words, Part Two.'\""

      "Putin \u201cis ready to meet with President Zelenskyy, provided this meeting is really going to decide something,\u201d he said. \u201cTo meet, for Zelenskyy to have another opportunity to be onstage, is not what we believe is useful.\u201d",
      "Even as Trump has met separately this month with Putin, Zelenskyy and European leaders, his overtures for peace have been undermined by Russia\u2019s continued deadly strikes on Ukraine, including on a U.S.-owned factory last week.",
      "The White House is now seeking a Putin-Zelenskyy summit, but Lavrov\u2019s grievances underscored just how far apart the two sides remain.",
      "He said it was Ukraine that was hindering the peace process, along with European leaders who Lavrov said \u201cdon\u2019t want peace.\u201d",

      "Vice President JD Vance remains confident the U.S. can broker an end to the war between Russia and Ukraine despite potential hang-ups that have emerged since President Donald Trump\u2019s meeting this month with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "\u201cWe believe we\u2019ve already seen some significant concessions from both sides, just in the last few weeks,\u201d Vance said in an exclusive interview on NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d",
      "Vance also weighed in on a Russian missile strike in western Ukraine overnight Thursday that hit an electronics factory owned by a U.S.-based company. Asked by moderator Kristen Welker if he was \u201cenraged\u201d by the strike, which the company said injured  several workers, Vance pivoted to a criticism of former President Joe Biden.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like it,\u201d Vance said of the assault. \u201cBut this is a war, and this is why we want to stop the killing. The Russians have done a lot of things that we don\u2019t like. A lot of civilians have died. We\u2019ve condemned that stuff from the get-go and, frankly, President Trump has done more to apply pressure and to apply economic leverage to the Russians, certainly, than Joe Biden did for 3 \u00bd years, when he did nothing but talk, did nothing to bring the killing to a stop. So you asked me what I\u2019m enraged by? What I\u2019m enraged by is the continuation of the war.\u201d",
      "Trump told reporters Friday that he was not happy about the strikes on western Ukraine and indicated that any peace deal between the countries could be weeks away.",
      "\u201cI think over the next two weeks, we\u2019re going to find out which way it\u2019s going to go,\u201d Trump said.",
      "During his interview with \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Vance did not characterize the strike, and a number of other issues, as long-term hindrances to peace, saying there was still plenty of room for negotiation.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to eventually be successful, or we\u2019ll hit a brick wall. And if we hit a brick wall, then we\u2019re going to continue this process of negotiation, of applying leverage,\u201d Vance added. \u201cThis is the energetic diplomacy that\u2019s going to bring this war to a close.\u201d",
      "Welker then asked Vance what the pressure is on Russia if the U.S. is not \u201cimposing new sanctions.\u201d",
      "\u201cHow do you get them to a place of getting to the table with Zelenskyy and stopping to drop bombs?\u201d she asked.",
      "Vance replied by saying Trump has applied \u201caggressive economic leverage,\u201d such as \u201csecondary tariffs on India, to try to make it harder for the Russians to get rich from their oil economy.\u201d",
      "Asked by Welker if he could guarantee that the U.S. would not send troops to help enforce any peace deal, Vance reaffirmed Trump\u2019s opposition to such a deployment.",
      "\u201cThe president has been very clear,\u201d Vance said. \u201cThere are not going to be boots on the ground in Ukraine. But we are going to continue to play an active role in trying to ensure that the Ukrainians have the security guarantees and the confidence they need to stop the war on their end and the Russians feel like they can bring the war to a conclusion on their end.\u201d",
      "The interview, which aired Sunday, comes amid new, heightened tensions in the effort to end the war.",
      "On Friday, Russia\u2019s top diplomat told NBC News that no meetings between Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had been scheduled, raising further doubts about Trump\u2019s ability to mediate the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, details about security guarantees for Ukraine \u2014 and Russia\u2019s role in shaping them \u2014 remain unresolved.",
      "In the interview, Vance said he doesn\u2019t believe the Russians are stringing Trump along.",
      "\u201cI think the Russians have made significant concessions to President Trump for the first time in 3 \u00bd years of this conflict,\u201d he added. \u201cThey\u2019ve actually been willing to be flexible on some of their core demands. They\u2019ve talked about what would be necessary to end the war.\u201d",
      "Trump, Vance added, stepped up efforts to negotiate a diplomatic solution \u201cbecause this war is not in anyone\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not in Europe or the United States\u2019 interest.\u201d",
      "While acknowledging some of the hurdles that have popped up since Trump\u2019s Aug. 15 meeting with Putin in Alaska, Vance expressed optimism that persistence would deliver results.",
      "\u201cThere are hills and valleys to the negotiations,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe sometimes feel like we\u2019ve made great progress with the Russians, and sometimes, as the president has said, he\u2019s been very frustrated with the Russians. We\u2019re going to keep on doing what we have to do to bring this thing to a close. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen overnight. I think that we\u2019re going to continue to make progress. But, ultimately, whether the killing stops, that determination is going to belong to whether the Russians and Ukrainians can actually find some middle ground here.\u201d",
      "Putin has rejected calls \u2014 including from Trump before their recent meeting \u2014 for a ceasefire.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t say they conceded on everything,\u201d Vance said in the interview, referring to Russia. \u201cBut what they have conceded is the recognition that Ukraine will have territorial integrity after the war. They\u2019ve recognized that they\u2019re not going to be able to install a puppet regime in Kyiv. \u2026 Have they made every concession? Of course they haven\u2019t. Should they have started the war? Of course they [shouldn\u2019t have], but we\u2019re making progress.\u201d",
      "Asked about disagreements surrounding how involved Russia will be in establishing security guarantees for Ukraine, Vance asserted that \u201cthere\u2019s a little bit of talking past each other here.\u201d",
      "\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019re not talking about security guarantees until after the war has come to a close,\u201d Vance said. \u201cAnd, of course, the Russians are going to be a part of the conversation about bringing that war to a close. So, of course, they\u2019re going to have some stake in this.\u201d",
      "The interview with Vance also touched on several domestic issues, including new congressional maps passed by the Republican-controlled Texas House of Representatives that could pad the GOP\u2019s majority by as many as five seats. The issue has become a political flashpoint, with California Democrats preparing retaliatory moves and other states aiming to redraw maps, too.",
      "\u201cAll we\u2019re doing, frankly, is trying to make the situation a little bit more fair on a national scale,\u201d Vance said of GOP efforts. \u201cThe Democrats have gerrymandered their states really aggressively. We think there are opportunities to push back against that, and that\u2019s really all we\u2019re doing.\u201d",
      "On the subject of his own political ambitions, Vance again sidestepped questions about whether he sees himself as Trump\u2019s heir apparent in 2028, when the president is term-limited.",
      "\u201cI see myself as a vice president who\u2019s trying to do a good job for the American people ... and if I do a good job, and if the president continues to be successful, as I know that he will be, the politics will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said. \u201cWe can cross that bridge when we come to it.\u201d",
      "Welker asked if Vance has discussed the possibility with Trump.",
      "\u201cAs you know, the president talks about everything, and if it\u2019s in the news, the president and I have certainly discussed it,\u201d Vance replied. \u201cBut I think the president is just focused on doing a good job for the American people. He wants me to be focused on doing a good job for the American people. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll keep on doing.\u201d"

      "President Donald Trump signed an executive order last month abolishing the trade loophole known as \u201cde minimis,\u201d which since 2016 had allowed goods worth up to $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "The end of the exemption is being extended worldwide after the loophole was closed in May for packages from mainland China and Hong Kong.",
      "Under the new rules, personal gifts worth less than $100 will still be duty-free, but all other packages will face the same tariffs as standard imports from their country of origin.",
      "The planned policy shift, which operators say lacks clear procedures, has raised concerns about backlogs as services are put on hold.",
      "Postal providers in Belgium, Denmark and New Zealand are among several operators that have already suspended shipments of packages to the U.S. until they can retool their systems to comply with the new rules. Letters and documents are generally unaffected.",
      "Services in Germany, France, Britain and India have announced they will follow suit in the coming days.",
      "France\u2019s national postal service, La Poste, said in a statement that the U.S. did not provide full details or allow enough time to prepare for new customs procedures. New Zealand\u2019s postal service said parcel deliveries to all U.S. states and territories would be \u201ctemporarily unavailable until further notice\u201d while systems are updated to meet new U.S. customs requirements.",
      "DHL, one of the world\u2019s largest courier companies, said Friday that it will stop accepting parcels containing goods from business customers destined for the U.S. beginning Monday.",
      "The company cited unresolved \u201ckey questions\u201d about the process, including \u201chow and by whom customs duties will be collected in the future, what additional data will be required, and how the data transmission to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will be carried out.\u201d",
      "DHL will, however, continue to deliver private parcels labeled as gifts valued under $100, in line with White House assurances.",
      "The White House said ending the duty-free exemption would help combat \u201cescalating deceptive shipping practices, illegal material, and duty circumvention,\u201d claiming some shippers had \u201cabused\u201d the exemption to send illicit drugs such as fentanyl into the U.S.",
      "It said the number of de minimis parcels jumped from 134 million in 2015 to more than 1.36 billion in 2024 as shippers \u201cdeceptively exploit the de minimis privilege in an effort to evade duties,  inspection, and U.S. law.\u201d",
      "Most of those packages came from mainland China and Hong Kong, which the Trump administration initially targeted as part of efforts to curb American shoppers from ordering low-value goods from China-linked retailers such as Temu and Shein.",
      "The White House briefly closed the loophole for mainland China and Hong Kong in February, but quickly extended the deadline to May 2 amid confusion over how the new duties would be collected."

      "The changes have come as hospitals attempt to comply with state laws, which in many instances prohibit discriminating against trans people in medical care, as well as federal guidance, which in recent months has threatened to revoke hospitals\u2019 federal funding or charge them with civil or criminal penalties if they continue to provide trans care to patients younger than 19.",
      "Patients and families affected by these changes in care have described the effects as devastating.",
      "One Florida mom, who asked that her name not be published due to fears that she could face harassment or be targeted by the federal government, recently bought one-way tickets to Berlin so she and her 15-year-old trans daughter could move there next month. The mom has acquired a language-learning visa, and her daughter will be able to live with her because she is a minor.",
      "When her daughter first sought access to transition care, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis\u2019 administration and state Republican legislators were trying to ban it, so in September 2021, the teen and her dad started driving 11 hours to Alabama every few months so she could access care at the University of Alabama\u2019s gender clinic. Then, in August 2023, a court allowed a care ban to take effect in Alabama. Last July, they began flying to Washington, D.C., to receive care at Children\u2019s National Hospital.",
      "Last month, the hospital announced in a message on its website that \u201cin light of escalating legal and regulatory risks to Children\u2019s National, our providers, and the families we serve, we will be discontinuing the prescription of gender-affirming medications\u201d effective Aug. 30.",
      "The mom said even if she could find another doctor in the U.S. for her daughter, she fears the family might have just one visit \u201cbefore the government steps in again.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhere can we go?\u201d she said. \u201cGrowing up, we were always told that America is the greatest country in the world, and now we\u2019re having to flee so that my child can get the health care she needs, and for our safety.\u201d",
      "\u2018These threats are no longer theoretical\u2019",
      "Since 2021, 27 states have enacted measures prohibiting access to puberty blockers, hormone therapy and/or surgeries for trans minors as part of a wider effort to restrict trans rights.",
      "Supporters of the legislation say the care has not been adequately studied, can have harmful long-term effects and that minors cannot actually consent to it. However, doctors who treat trans youth say puberty blockers and hormone therapy have been provided to minors who are not trans for decades to treat other conditions, such as precocious puberty. In addition, nearly all major medical associations in the United States support access to transition-related care for minors and oppose restrictions on it, with the American Medical Association calling government restrictions \u201ca dangerous intrusion into the practice of medicine.\u201d",
      "A study published earlier this year in JAMA Pediatrics found that less than 0.1% of adolescents in the U.S. with private insurance in the United States are trans and are prescribed puberty blockers or gender-affirming hormones. A 2024 study published by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that the rate of teens ages 15 to 17 undergoing gender-affirming surgery was 2.1 per 100,000.",
      "The remaining states where care is legal \u2014 particularly California, Colorado, Oregon, Illinois, Washington, Connecticut and Pennsylvania \u2014 have seen an influx of out-of-state patients, with some parents of trans minors even relocating their families to those states to maintain care for their kids.",
      "Parents of trans youths have seen those states \u2014 and hospitals such as the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles, which is home to one of the nation\u2019s oldest gender clinics \u2014 as safe havens.",
      "However, in January, the Trump administration began targeting providers of trans care, including an executive order that sought to bar federal funding from going to medical schools and hospitals that provide such care to people younger than 19. In March, a federal judge blocked that part of the order, and some hospitals resumed treatments.",
      "But then, in April, Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a memo that said the Justice Department would investigate doctors who provide transition care to minors under existing laws, including laws against genital mutilation. In July, the DOJ sent subpoenas to more than 20 doctors and clinics that provide such care. A subpoena sent to the Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, which was made public Monday as part of a legal filing attempting to block the investigations, requested the names, birth dates, Social Security numbers, addresses and parent/guardian information of all patients who were prescribed puberty blockers or hormone therapy.",
      "The Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the FBI and the Federal Trade Commission have also taken action to restrict care, both for minors and adults.",
      "Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles mentioned all of these actions and more in a June 12 letter to hospital staff detailing its decision to close the Center for Transyouth Health and Development, which has been running for three decades, effective July 22.",
      "The letter, which a spokesperson for the hospital shared with NBC News, described an HHS review published in May \u201cdismissing current evidence-based care protocols and standards of care while promoting alternative best practices for the treatment of pediatric gender dysphoria.\u201d The HHS review \u201cincluded dozens of references to CHLA and the Center for Transyouth Health and Development,\u201d the letter said.",
      "\u201cTaken together, the Attorney General memo, HHS review, and the recent solicitation of tips from the FBI to report hospitals and providers of [gender-affirming care] strongly signal this Administration\u2019s intent to take swift and decisive action, both criminal and civil, against any entity it views as being in violation of the executive order,\u201d this hospital\u2019s leadership wrote. \u201cThese threats are no longer theoretical. The federal government has already cut off hundreds of millions of dollars from U.S. academic and research institutions for noncompliance with executive orders, often with little to no warning.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, more than a dozen states, led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, sued the Trump administration to block investigations into doctors and hospitals who provide gender-affirming care to minors.",
      "The complaint argued that the federal government was trying to institute a national ban on such care when Congress has not passed one, violating the 10th Amendment by trying to usurp the power of states that have not passed bans. It also argued that hospitals were being forced to either defy the federal threats or comply and violate state laws against discrimination in medical care.",
      "Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement at the time that Americans support Trump\u2019s efforts to stop \u201cthe despicable mutilation and chemical castration of children,\u201d using inflammatory language to describe transition care.",
      "\u201cThe President has the lawful authority to protect America\u2019s vulnerable children through executive action, and the Administration looks forward to ultimate victory on this issue,\u201d Rogers said.",
      "Robin Maril, an assistant professor of constitutional law at Oregon\u2019s Willamette University, said the Trump administration is attempting to restrict access to transition care through guidance issued by regulatory agencies. That guidance tells doctors and hospitals \u201cexactly how the government is going to go after them,\u201d Maril said.",
      "Hospitals are weighing losing all federal funding, which could force them to close, Maril said, or standing up to the Trump administration.",
      "\u201cTo stand up to the Trump administration at this point would result in kids losing care for all sorts of things,\u201d Maril said.",
      "\u2018That\u2019s just not fair\u2019",
      "The climate created by the administration\u2019s policies, the investigations and the legal battles have been surreal for Dr. Kade Goepferd, the chief education officer at Children\u2019s Minnesota and a pediatrician in the hospital\u2019s Gender Health Program, which has not ceased or paused trans care for minors.",
      "Goepferd, who uses they/them pronouns, said their patients\u2019 parents are scared, and the kids don\u2019t understand why their friends can access any health care when needed, but they might not be able to access this specific type of care because they\u2019re trans.",
      "\u201cThey feel very singled out,\u201d Goepferd said. \u201cThe teenagers feel a lot of hopelessness. The younger kids feel a lot of fear for what their future may or may not be like.\u201d",
      "Goepferd said they have several patients who have moved or plan to move out of the country due to the increasingly restrictive care landscape for trans youth, and the number of out-of-state patients they see has increased over the last few years. The clinic\u2019s waitlist for a first appointment is about six months.",
      "They said one of their greatest concerns \u201cis that we are tying the ability of transgender young people to access care they need, and the ability of their parents to make medical decisions for them, to the general public\u2019s ability to understand who they are and what their medical care is.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s just not fair,\u201d they said. \u201cWe don\u2019t do that with other areas of medicine. We rely on medical guidelines and expertise to make decisions. So we\u2019re treating essential health care for transgender youth as exceptional in some way, and what I wish people knew more than anything is that it is not. I provide this type of health care the same way I provide any other type of health care.\u201d",
      "As for the Florida mom, she said that as soon as her daughter could talk she would point to Daphne in the cartoon \u201cScooby Doo\u201d and say, \u201cI that girl.\u201d A psychiatrist said the child was \u201cpersistent, insistent and consistent\u201d in her gender for years, and they have supported her and spent at least $7,500 on travel to access care in other states.",
      "But now, she said, it feels like they\u2019re out of options, and she\u2019ll be flying to Berlin with her daughter in September and leaving her three other children in the States with their dad.",
      "\u201cIt was like a nice fantasy that I would live in Europe one day, but then it became this absolute necessity, and I have to leave my other kids, and I don\u2019t even know how to explain how fearful I feel and how heartbreaking this is,\u201d she said."

    "summary": "Dutch dental experts creating a definitive oral care guide share science-backed tips: use electric brushes, pea-sized toothpaste, and consider interdental brushes.",
    "story": [
      "Few people know more about the best way to clean your mouth than Dagmar Else Slot and Fridus van der Weijden. This Dutch dental duo has authored more than 100 research papers together, and now they\u2019re attempting something especially ambitious: writing the definitive guide to cleaning your teeth and gums.",
      "Slot, a dental hygienist, and van der Weijden, a dentist, have made this guide their life\u2019s mission. They\u2019ve been at it for 15 years, and they\u2019re not done yet.",
      "They say that in their decades of work, they\u2019ve found that people often think they\u2019re doing a good job with their dental hygiene, but in fact it\u2019s quite subpar.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of supervised neglect,\u201d Slot said. \u201cEverybody brushes their teeth, but you probably learned how from your parents, and in the end nobody really learns it right. In almost 100% of cases, there is room for improvement.\u201d",
      "Along with a team of doctoral students, Slot and van der Weijden are combing through thousands of studies to create a science-based dental manifesto answering home-care dental questions:",
      "Which kind of toothbrush is best?What about toothpaste?How long should you brush for?Does mouthwash really help fight cavities?",
      "Which kind of toothbrush is best?",
      "What about toothpaste?",
      "How long should you brush for?",
      "Does mouthwash really help fight cavities?",
      "Slot, a professor of preventive oral health, and Van der Weijden, a professor emeritus of periodontology, both at the Academic Centre for Dentistry in Amsterdam, decided to undertake this mammoth project after decades of getting peppered with home-care dental questions from patients, colleagues and friends. As scientists, they wanted to respond based on the body of published research, not just their own opinions and observations.",
      "\u201cTo be honest, I didn\u2019t have an answer,\u201d van der Weijden said.",
      "He does know that dental health is in a pretty bad state. In the U.S., about 40% of adults age 30 or older have gum disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 90% of us between 20 and 64 have had tooth decay, according to the National Institutes of Health.",
      "Misinformation about fluoride",
      "\u201cOn social media, influencers are telling people to be fluoride-free and to do oil pulling where you swish your mouth with oil,\u201d Slot said. \u201cThey\u2019re not giving advice based on science.\u201d",
      "Best practices matter \u2014 especially if you live in a community or state in the U.S. that\u2019s considering banning fluoride in public drinking water, which could lead to an increase in dental problems.",
      "Tooth pain can be miserable",
      "In 2017, there were 2.1 million emergency room visits for dental emergencies, according to the CDC. That doesn\u2019t include visits to the dentist to get a cavity filled or a root canal \u2014 and having someone drill in your mouth is never fun.",
      "Bad teeth can be costly",
      "In 2021, Americans who had at least one dental visit that year spent an average of $887 on dental care, according to the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The costs don\u2019t stop there: Almost $46 billion is lost in productivity in the U.S. each year because of untreated oral disease, according to the CDC.",
      "Third, your mouth is connected to the rest of your body. Gum disease has been associated with a number of health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes, according to the American Dental Association. A 2016 analysis of periodontal disease research found that gum disease may be linked to 57 chronic conditions, including diabetes, cardiovascular and liver diseases, as well as preterm births.",
      "Slot and van der Weijden said they need another three years or so to complete their magnum opus. In the meantime, they shared their recommended best practices for adult dental care, along with suggestions from two U.S. dental experts: Lancette VanGuilder, president of the American Dental Hygienists\u2019 Association, and Dr. Mia Geisinger, president of the American Academy of Periodontology.",
      "Use an electric toothbrush for two minutes",
      "The experts said you need pretty spectacular technique to make a traditional toothbrush work as effectively as an electric one. They suggested one with a timer, so you\u2019ll brush for the full two minutes. The American Dental Association recommends soft bristles, and the experts said the size and shape of the toothbrush head (rectangular or circle) depends on the size of your mouth and other personal factors.",
      "Use a pea-size amount of toothpaste",
      "More isn\u2019t better here, because excessive toothpaste might trick you.",
      "A mouth full of foam might hide the fact that your gums are bleeding, and that\u2019s an important warning sign you should notice and discuss with your dentist, VanGuilder said. Van der Weijden has another reason not to load up your brush.",
      "\u201cToothpastes have surfactants \u2014 a detergent \u2014 which makes your teeth feel smooth, so you have an almost immediate sensation that you\u2019ve cleaned your teeth when probably you haven\u2019t done a good job,\u201d he said.",
      "The American Dental Association recommends only toothpastes that contain fluoride.",
      "For teeth in the back, consider a second smaller brush",
      "If your toothbrush is too big to get to your back teeth, consider buying a child-sized brush to reach them, VanGuilder said. Also, closing your mouth a bit relaxes your jaw muscles and gives you more space back there.",
      "For between teeth, use tiny interdental brushes",
      "\u201cUsing floss appropriately is very difficult,\u201d said Slot. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t work well in everybody\u2019s hands.\u201d Several studies, including a 2018 review of 22 clinical trials, found that interdental brushes were better than floss or other tools at reducing gum inflammation. Some have rubber bristles and some have nylon bristles. Both are available in drug stores, and these tiny interdental brushes are meant to supplement a regular toothbrush, not replace it.",
      "Should you floss or brush first?",
      "Geisinger, the periodontist, recommends cleaning between your teeth first and then brushing \u2014 she says it\u2019s helpful to get the big pieces of gunk out so the brush can get in and do its work.",
      "If you prefer floss, the experts said it generally doesn\u2019t matter if you choose waxed or unwaxed \u2014 whichever you like best is fine.",
      "Yes, mouthwash is easy \u2014 but be careful",
      "\u201cMany people will pick mouthwash instead of cleaning in between your teeth, and cleaning in between your teeth is really much more beneficial,\u201d Geisinger said. If you do want to use mouthwash along with floss or interdental brushes, she warns that mouthwashes with alcohol can contribute to tooth decay for people with dry mouths."

      "The man on the passenger side opened the door and slammed his gun into Waller\u2019s right ear and scalp, knocking him out for a moment. When he came to, he was still strapped into his seat belt, blood flowing down the side of his head.",

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",

      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

      "Family members of a prominent victim of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sexual abuse said they were \u201coutraged\u201d by the Justice Department\u2019s decision to release transcripts from Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s testimony last month to a federal prosecutor, arguing it provided Maxwell a \u201cplatform to rewrite history.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe content of these transcripts is in direct contradiction with felon Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019s conviction for child sex trafficking,\u201d the family of Virginia Roberts Giuffre said in a statement. The family added, \u201cThis travesty of justice entirely invalidates the experiences of the many brave survivors who put their safety, security, and lives on the line to ensure her conviction, including our sister.\u201d",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche last month questioned Maxwell, who is serving a 20-year prison sentence on sex trafficking charges, for two days as part of a stated effort by the Trump administration to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes.",
      "The Justice Department on Friday released audio and transcripts of the two-day interview, during which Maxwell disputed several allegations of wrongdoing against her and Epstein, including by Giuffre, who died by suicide in April.",
      "Giuffre accused Maxwell of grooming her to be sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked to several of his powerful friends, including Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Giuffre separately sued Andrew in 2021 alleging he sexually abused her as a minor, which he has denied. The two later settled the case for an undisclosed amount in 2022.",
      "During the interview last month with Blanche, Maxwell said Giuffre\u2019s allegation against Andrew \u201cdoesn\u2019t hold water,\u201d and disputed key facts in the case, including an alleged photo of Giuffre with Andrew.",
      "\u201cI believe that this whole thing was manufactured, and I can point you to some potentially corroborating evidence of this,\u201d Maxwell told Blanche.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s family accused the deputy attorney general of not sufficiently challenging Maxwell\u2019s assertions during her testimony, suggesting that by publicly releasing the interview, the Justice Department provided Maxwell the opportunity to dispute her case in the court of public opinion.",
      "\u201cDuring [Deputy Attorney General] Todd Blanche\u2019s bizarre interview, she is never challenged about her court-proven lies, providing her a platform to rewrite history,\u201d the family statement read.",
      "Maxwell also said she never witnessed any inappropriate conduct from any man, including Donald Trump. She denied the existence of an incriminating \u201cclient list\u201d of individuals who benefited from Epstein\u2019s crimes and maintained her innocence after being convicted of sex trafficking in 2021.",
      "On Sunday, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., criticized Maxwell\u2019s statements to Blanche, claiming that she has the motivation to say anything that could potentially get her pardoned.",
      "\u201cThey go and they do this interview without the presence of a prosecutor who actually knows the facts,\u201d Schiff told NBC News\u2019 \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d referring to Blanche.",
      "\u201cShe wants a pardon. She says exactly what her lawyers tell her is going to be necessary to get a pardon. No one should be surprised here,\u201d Schiff added.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s family has for months been critical of the Justice Department\u2019s interactions with Maxwell amid the Trump administration\u2019s claimed push to uncover more information about Epstein\u2019s crimes, a key topic of interest among Trump\u2019s base.",
      "In late July, after Maxwell met with Blanche, the family urged the government not to provide Maxwell any favorable treatment, describing her then as a \u201cmonster who deserves to rot in prison for the rest of her life.\u201d",
      "Trump has not ruled out the idea of pardoning Maxwell, whom he has known for several decades. When asked last month about the prospect of granting Maxwell legal relief, Trump said, \u201cI\u2019m allowed to do it, but it\u2019s something I have not thought about.\u201d",
      "Absent a pardon from Trump, Maxwell is seeking legal relief from the Supreme Court, which has indicated it will decide whether to review Maxwell\u2019s appeal of her conviction during a private conference in September.",
      "Giuffre\u2019s family also condemned the Justice Department\u2019s decision to transfer Maxwell to a minimum-security prison following her meeting with Blanche.",
      "\u201cBy moving convicted felon Maxwell to a minimum-security, country club prison, the DOJ sends a disturbing message that child sex trafficking is acceptable and will be rewarded,\u201d the family said Saturday in a statement.",
      "Federal officials moved Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s co-conspirator and confidant, from a co-ed, low-security prison in Tallahassee, Florida, to a women-only, minimum-security facility in Bryan, Texas. The Bureau of Prisons at the time did not specify why Maxwell was transferred to the facility, which also houses reality television star Jen Shah and disgraced Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes.",
      "The release of the Maxwell transcripts came as the Justice Department also partially fulfilled a subpoena by the House Oversight Committee for all files related to the federal investigation of Epstein. The Justice Department released roughly 33,000 documents, however Democrats on the committee have said the \u201cvast majority\u201d of the records included in the first batch were already public."

      "Wicked Willy\u2019s, a bar in Manhattan, got on board by offering a \u201cRecession Pop Party\u201d earlier this month, with one caption on an Instagram post declaring: \u201cThe recession is BACK! Get ready to dance and party all night long!\u201d",

      "The idea for the burger\u2019s name didn\u2019t necessarily come from a desire to cash in on the buzzword, said Ed Onas, Super Duper\u2019s vice president of operations. Instead, he said, the moniker was derived from the Depression-era origins of the Oklahoma-style smash burger, which aimed to stretch ground beef by adding lots of sliced onions.",
      "But once Super Duper established the burger\u2019s name, the chain decided to offer a discounted \u201cRecession Combo\u201d for $10. This would save customers $5 from the normal price of the add-ons, Onas said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s kind of where the name of the burger plays in \u2026 And we figured, we\u2019re calling it the \u2018Recession Combo,\u2019 why don\u2019t we just offer a deal that makes it a really good value for our guests?\u201d Onas told CNBC in an interview. \u201cInflation has kind of been going on, and we figured it\u2019s a nice offer for a short amount of time for our guests.\u201d",
      "This extra-value combo meal was an exception for Super Duper, which normally doesn\u2019t offer such deals. The burger went viral in a local San Francisco subreddit, with a post gaining 1,400 upvotes and 170 comments.",
      "\u201cObviously, we were happy about it. We didn\u2019t realize that it was going to get as much attention as it did,\u201d Onas said. \u201cWe were happy, and our guests were happy, and at the end of the day, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "As a testament to the burger\u2019s overwhelming success, Onas told CNBC that Super Duper will be adding it onto its menu as a permanent fixture going forward.",
      "Shedding light on waning consumer sentiment",
      "These small businesses getting in on the trend could be a broader reaction to waning consumer confidence. Consider that the University of Michigan\u2019s consumer sentiment index came in at 58.6 in August, down from a reading of 61.7 in July and reflecting a 13.7% change on a year-over-year basis.",
      "This souring in sentiment has been driven primarily by concerns over trade policy, said Joanne Hsu, director of the surveys of consumers at the University of Michigan.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s very clear from the consumer sentiment data is that consumers are broadly bracing for a slowdown in the economy and a deterioration \u2014 not just with inflation, expecting inflation to get worse \u2014 but they\u2019re also expecting businesses conditions to deteriorate,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re expecting labor markets to weaken and unemployment rates to go up. And what you\u2019re seeing with these businesses could be a reaction to that.\u201d",
      "A lack of consumer confidence \u2014 and trust in income reliability \u2014 will ultimately lead to a pullback in spending, Hsu added.",
      "\u201cYoung people are feeling just as bad about the economy as older folks, and in some months they feel even worse than older folks,\u201d she said. \u201cAcross the age distribution, people agree that the trajectory of the economy has soured.\u201d"

I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m an after yet. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m at the point.\u201d",

Midnight is a \u201chopeless romantic\u201d (derogatory) who \u201cdesperately need a nice, stable bald man\u201d to keep him grounded. Jericko holds a secret disco obsession and binge-watches Elizabeth Taylor documentaries to get her out of a slump.",

      "\"If I went to an event, I would wear a designer. Often I wore a lot of vintage,\" she said. \"I was working really quite a lot in the '90s so I was often just on sets and wearing jeans and a T-shirt.\"",

      "\"I have a T-shirt from every show I've been to, which started very young,\" she shared. \"My dad took me to a lot of the early, like, late '70s, early '80s punk rock (concerts).\"",
      "Ryder said she still has the first concert T-shirt she ever owned, from The Clash's short 1980 tour of the United States. The shirt is so old that it's unwearable, she said, so she keeps it framed.",
      "Looking back, Ryder says her fashion choices in the '90s were all about being true to herself.",
      "\"You know when you're in your 20s, you try to, I don't know, you almost try to do what wasn't trendy. Because a lot of the trends were, I'm sorry, they were awful,\" she said. \"I just wanted to be my own self, and I was also very into recycling and showing people that you can look good and not spend a ton of money.",
      "\"Things are not meant to be worn only once,\" added Ryder. \"That was what always drove me nuts about the events. I remember re-wearing things a lot and apparently that was looked down upon sometimes. I thought it was a great thing.\""

    "summary": "Shawn Hatosy previews Season 2 of \"The Pitt,\" shares why the show is resonating so much and how he's preparing to direct Episode 9.",
    "story": [
      "Shawn Hatosy is getting ready to clock back in for a shift at \"The Pitt.\"",
      "The medical drama, which premiered in January 2025, is on a fast track rarely seen in streaming shows these days. Filming for Season 2 is well underway, and a teaser for the sophomore outing dropped Aug. 21. But eagle-eyed fans may have noticed that Hatosy's character, the internet's favorite night shift attending, Dr. Jack Abbot, wasn't seen in any of the clips.",
      "Shabana Azeez, who stars in the show as medical student Victoria Javadi, joked on her Instagram that Abbot is in a \"retirement home.\" Hatosy has another explanation.",
      "\"I have not shown up yet,\" he tells TODAY.com. \"I'm still about to, so getting prepared for that. I know the cast and crew have been diligently kicking away for a couple months now. So I'm getting ready.\"",
      "The 15-episode procedural \"The Pitt\" has received acclaim for its unconventional format \u2014 each episode reflects one hour of an emergency room shift, with the whole season comprising just one day in the life. Season 1 opens with senior emergency attending Dr. Michael \u201cRobby\u201d Robinavitch, played by Noah Wyle, arriving for his shift, relieving a distraught Abbot. In the first episode, Robinavitch finds Abbot on the roof, who asks why they continue to show up at the grueling job each day.",
      "By the end of the season, Abbot makes a triumphant return to the emergency department in the wake of a mass casualty shooting. He ends the day answering his own question\u00a0\u2014 \"We\u2019re the bees that protect the hive,\" he says \u2014 effectively solidifying his character's arc and making Abbot a \"fully formed character,\" Hatosy says.",
      "\"I feel like I have his backstory down to this point,\" Hatosy says. \"I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that.\"",
      "Below, Hatosy previews what could be in store for Abbot in Season 2, unpacks his character's buzzy chemistry with Dr. Samira Mohan (Supriya Ganesh) and reflects on being nominated for an Emmy Award for best guest actor in a drama series.",
      "This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
      "I don't actually know the answer to the first question.",
      "I love the show. I love the character. I think that the night shift has a lot of elements that people respond to. I think it takes a certain type of individual to decide to work nights, and Abbot would be the leader of that because his therapist says he finds comfort in the darkness. I would love to check in once the original \"Pitt\" is up and running, because that's the first priority. But if the writers have the bandwidth for it, I mean, I would love it.",
      "I think No. 1, the medicine. We don't dumb it down in any way. We treat it as it is. So I think the audience, even though they may not understand it \u2014\u00a0I certainly don't understand some of the things that are happening \u2014 there's a trust there. You expect them to follow it, and they do.",
      "I also think the immersive feeling of the narrative being one day, I think it adds to the excitement and the adrenaline. And then the characters are all so well drawn. Each has their own distinct point of view, and people respond to that. I also think that they're all inherently decent people working there, and in a world that's very divided right now, they have pledged to take care of everybody and do their job and save lives.",
      "They do. I'm the target of that sometimes.",
      "Oh yeah, of course. There's always a healthy dose of nerves and fear when you're both directing and acting. The first time you present a character on a TV show, it's terrifying because you're like, \"Whatever I do now I have to commit to for however many years this goes.\" So there's just a lot of anxiety. With directing, you're responsible for so many departments and ideas, and it's definitely scary, but that is what keeps you working so hard. It's a good scary. It's the kind that you need to sort of give you that lift.",
      "But like you said, listen, I'm a performer. So there's a language that actors have with each other. So my first point of attention is always going to be towards the performance, because that's where I come from. So even though they may call me old and a grandpa and chronically online, or whatever they say, I will power through it.",
      "I've said it before, there was a scene early on where he talks about how she's one of the smartest people here. I think that he's not just saying that, I think he believes that. He just respects her. I think he sees her as the future of the ER. There's some light flirting happening, and it's definitely layered into the script. Some writers may say, \"No, we were just putting stuff there.\" But it seems obvious to me. I think that the scene with the pigtail catheter, where he's ... sort of insisting that she do it, even though there's only one case in history of this exact procedure that's ever been done \u2014 it just shows how much he respects her. And sometimes that can turn into something more, you know, when you're working together.",
      "We haven't. I'm actually curious to see how she feels. She might be like, \"Ew, gross,\" and it's possible.",
      "I did read something that Noah said online yesterday in an interview where he was talking about Abbot in Season 2. I don't know much, but I did hear him say that they're going to delve deeper into Abbot's backstory and his relationship with his deceased wife. He still wears his wedding ring. That's one of the pieces of hidden trauma that I knew about, but we haven't gone into yet, but I think we might deal with it this season.",
      "It's still a mystery to me. I've received scripts, though. I'm just about now ready to sit down and plunge in. For directing, I'm going to have to catch up.",
      "They're kind of mirror images of each other, but one is night, one is day. (Laughs). I think the writers did a really nice job of the way that they presented the bookends of the roof scenes. Abbot, seemingly coming off of a horrendous night shift, losing this vet who he spent three hours trying to save, I think that affected him and made him question his purpose. And by the end of the shift, he's up on the roof and the roles are reversed now. Robby has had his worst day, and Abbot is metaphorically talking him off the ledge.",
      "But Abbot's purpose is crystallized in that moment. He figures out that the reason that he keeps coming back is because they're the bees that protect the hive. It's in his DNA \u2014 I think that that line is pure Abbot. It's the spine of how I shape that character.",
      "I think he is in many ways, at least at the end of Season 1, a kind of a fully formed character, whereas Robby has experienced a type of PTSD that will need attention. Abbot has proven and said that he's working on himself, and it'll be nice to find out if Robby will go that path.",
      "I don't know about that. There's so much about just the way he carries himself that's very much me. I was trying to avoid creating something that was transformative. I wanted him to be as close to me as possible. Sometimes that can be challenging, playing somebody that's very close to you, somebody that's like you. So there's that.",
      "I think it's amazing that he's had a rough night, and he's sitting there in his whatever, I don't know, house, van, I don't know, listening to a police scanner, just waiting for an emergency. I think that does say a lot about him. And I do think Season 2 will highlight a little bit more of what he does in his off time, and we will learn maybe why he does stuff like that.",
      "No, I think as actors, we often create these little things to give energy or life to a scene. ... That's kind of the training that you get as an actor. So it's just even the Mohan stuff, whether or not it was explicit, the nuance for me was always this sort of feeling of flutter that he gets with her. Because he does respect her, and she responds.",
      "You're always trying to build a backstory. And what's incredible about episodic television is sometimes even the writers create a backstory, and they tell you that, and then you get to, like, Season 3, and it completely changes, and you just have to accept that. That's how the stuff that I build in there\u00a0\u2014 it's never right, but you just kind of have it in there to bring nuance to the scene.",
      "I feel like I have his backstory down to this point. (Laughs.) I do believe that they will throw a monkey wrench into that. I've worked on John Wells-produced shows, this is my fifth show with him, and every single one of them, I've played pretty complex characters. Like for \"Southland,\" each season, Sammy Bryant would get to a place where I'm like, \"I don't know if he can recover from that.\" And then John will, and his staff of brilliant writers, always come up with a plan that knocks him down another peg. And I'm assuming that Abbot will have a very roller coaster, emotional plight.",
      "I'm feeling great. I'm so ... I'm overwhelmed. It means so much to get the support from the people in the business that do this. But more importantly, I think it's just exciting for the show, being recognized. I'm proud of the show. I think it has something important to say about health care workers, and it is a show that doesn't cost a lot of money compared to other shows, and it's shot in L.A. I think it's great for the business, this show, this model. And I hope that this success, the critical response, leads to more shows like it.",
      "And how I celebrated, (laughs), I was alone in a hotel room in Vancouver, actually. And my wife and I were on the phone, and then I received a lot of phone calls congratulating me. I think I've heard from everybody. And I don't drink anymore, and it's been a while since I've done that, but I actually was like, \"What am I going to do?\" So I went to Queen Elizabeth Park in Vancouver, and I played pickleball with complete strangers. So that's how I celebrated.",
      "No. (Laughs.) The nomination really is the win. It feels great. And it's been a grinding career, just grinding it out. So the nomination is great. Whatever happens from there? Thank you. And if not, OK. It's not going to change anything about how I work, or what this show looks like. We're gonna attack it from the same point of view.",
      "No, just go easy on me out there on the internet. I'm very sensitive."

The eighth season, which aired from September 2024 to May 2025, opened with Athena having to land a plane after a swarm of bees caused a midair crash (really).

      "\"I mean we're grown-ups, we know things can go this way sometimes. I remember saying to him, 'Listen, I've died a horrible death a number of times. Even as a queen, they've taken me out,'\" she adds with a laugh, seemingly referring to the death of her character Queen Ramonda in 2022's \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.\"",

After Chimney (Kenneth Choi) displayed symptoms of the virus, Athena and Buck (Oliver Stark) hunted down the one cure. After it was given to Chimney, Bobby revealed he was also infected, and Athena watched him die in quarantine through a glass wall.",
      "In a statement published by Variety after the episode aired, Krause said he would miss his \"9-1-1 family,\" with a special shoutout to \"my partner, Angela Bassett. Her strength and her sweetness, and us holding hands. We parted ways too soon. Much love.\""

As both are no strangers to the reality TV reunion experience \u2014 Cohen, the father of reunion specials on Bravo, and Madix, a former Bravo star \u2014 it\u2019s easy to see why they were the perfect people to help the Islanders unpack the season.",

And we had a really great chemistry. I feel like as the day went on, that became more and more apparent that we kind of just decided to take the bull by its horns. So as the day went on, we just really leaned into that.",

      "But I think there were a lot of things \u2014 when they first came to me with the idea of doing a reunion this season \u2014 that I said needed to be different. I said no one is allowed to sit behind me. \u2026 I was like, I really want to be able to send in some of my notes so that maybe at some point I can incorporate some of my own questions, which I was able to do here and there. And I think we were all in agreement that we wanted there to be less people out the entire time. So there was a structure, which I think really helped, because that was something (about) last year: I really wish that we were able to talk to them in smaller groups about specific things. And I think that that was something that \u2026 really helps to be able to have these deeper conversations that we wanted to have with them.",
      "I think they left in good spirits. There were a lot of things that I think a lot of them wanted to be able to express to each other \u2014 whether that was something that worked toward a resolution either way. Whether, like, we\u2019ll be friends now, or OK, maybe it\u2019s better off as not. I think that was important for them to be able to sit there, have that conversation and be able to move forward from there, and they all seem in great spirits.",
      "They\u2019re all so good at expressing how they feel about difficult topics. And that is something that I admire about them so much, because when I was that age, I don\u2019t think I had that. I even still struggle to have that ability. And I really look up to them in that way. I mean, I think there was a moment where Olandria and Chelley were expressing how they felt about something, and I just was in such awe of their ability to speak about their feelings so beautifully and clearly, and I struggle with that, so I always just find that very admirable.",
      "Well, in the past with \u201cVanderpump,\u201d I had seasons where I watched everything, and then there were times where I didn\u2019t. So I see both sides of watching or not watching. I think ultimately you have to do what\u2019s right for yourself. I do think that sometimes there\u2019s something that we\u2019re referencing that would be nice if everybody knew what we were talking about \u2014 but I also understand getting to a point where you\u2019re like, \"I just lived this whole thing. Do I need to relive it?\" So I definitely see both sides of that.",
      "Oh, my gosh. Well, I think they\u2019re all so different, and I think that\u2019s what\u2019s so cool. Even seeing some of the things that they\u2019ve been doing since then, they all have their own niche. And that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about them. I think that they each bring something unique to the table, so I\u2019m excited to see what they do from here.",

But I think it\u2019s really cool for them to be able to have this platform and realize their dreams with it. I think sometimes people online, they have a weird thing about whether they have a following or whatever. But I just think, you know, go for your dreams, and if this is the path that leads you there, then do it.",

I love seeing them \u2014 watching them succeed, it just makes me so happy. And I love those girls so much, and I love seeing them just out in this world, taking it by storm. They are stars, but I feel like we knew that at the beginning. I just remember watching all of them walk into the villa that first night and knew right away they were it \u2014 they had it.",

      "Tony Weaver Jr. thinks everyone should be a weirdo.",
      "\u201cA weirdo is a person with the ability to make the ordinary extraordinary. What a world would we have if all of us stepped out every day with the goal of really living and embodying that,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "Weaver is a multi-hyphenate author who believes that \u201cstories are the most positive tool for social change in the history of mankind.\u201d And with a platform that draws attention to conversations about diversity in the nerd community, initiatives that serve to promote literacy and his debut graphic novel \u201cWeirdo,\u201d he\u2019s doing just that.",
      "\u201cWhen people read \u2018Weirdo,' I want them to feel seen, nurtured and inspired. The idea is that you should open (it) and immediately go, \u2018Oh, I belong in this world. I belong with these characters. These characters are like me. These characters are like my friends,\u2019\u201d Weaver says. \"'They feel the same way that I felt.'\"",
      "'A Deep Responsibility'",
      "This section discusses suicide. If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org.",
      "\u201cWeirdo\u201d is an Eisner Award-nominated, semi-autobiographical graphic novel memoir that combines nerd culture and magical realism to tell Weaver\u2019s personal story of navigating bullying and self-doubt \"but ultimately finding light on the other side.\"",
      "Weaver, who has been open about previously attempting suicide, says he felt a \u201cdeep responsibility\u201d to help kids navigate their darkest moments when he decided to write \u201cWeirdo.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat I like to say is that stories saved my life, so I like using stories to help other people,\" he says.",
      "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2023 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 20.4% of high school students seriously considered attempting suicide, while 9.5% had attempted suicide.",
      "\u201cLooking at those staggering rates and having first-hand experience of how it feels to have to navigate those negative emotions, I felt like it was my responsibility to do something,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something very humbling about the idea that there\u2019s a parent who loves their child more than anything in the world, and when that child, that person that they care about more than words can describe, needs help, they reach for something that has my name on it,\u201d he adds.",
      "Weaver also believes that using a visual medium, like a graphic novel, can help readers understand feelings that they may not be able to express with words.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a moment in \u2018Weirdo\u2019 where so much is going wrong in my life that it feels like I\u2019m losing all of the color in the world around me,\" he explains. \"So visually, we demonstrate that motif by literally having the colors drain from the pages until the comic is black and white.\u201d",
      "Weaver also uses his extensive knowledge of manga and anime within the world of \u201cWeirdo.\u201d From \"Pok\u00e9mon\" to \"Ace Attorney\" and \"JoJo\u2019s Bizarre Adventure,\" there are at least 50 references in the novel \u2014 with the first three pages having 12 alone. He calls the references the novel\u2019s \u201cstrongest advantage\u201d as it helps create a fantastical mirror of readers' own world.",
      "\u201cI want kids of a variety of fandoms to look at what we\u2019re making and say, \u2018Oh, I belong here. This guy gets it. These people understand me. I can be safe here,\u2019\u201d he says.",
      "But it\u2019s not just kids who feel seen while reading Weaver\u2019s work. Though \u201cWeirdo\u201d is marketed as a middle grade novel, it has managed to strike a chord with adults as well.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve had the privilege to speak to a lot of adult readers of \u2018Weirdo\u2019 and normally the story goes something like this: \u2018I got it for my son, I got it for my nephew, I got it for my niece, and I sat down and read it before I gave it to them, because I wanted to vet it. And, man, I wish I had this book when I was younger.\u2019 I think that\u2019s the highest praise that a person can receive,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think that motivates me a lot as I create. What I say is that \u2018Weirdo\u2019 is for every person on their journey to self-love. Some of us take that journey when we\u2019re kids. Others of us end up very far into adulthood before we\u2019re able to take those steps. But it\u2019s my goal that it\u2019ll be there as a support for everybody,\" he adds.",
      "In addition to being an author, Weaver is the founder and CEO of Weird Enough Productions, a media company dedicated to using anime to create positive representations of Black men and other minority groups. Through Weird Enough Productions, Weaver and his team, along with collaborators like anime distributor Crunchyroll, aim to boost reading proficiency among marginalized readers by helping them connect with characters in manga and comics.",
      "According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress, 33% of 8th graders are not reading at the NAEP Basic level, meaning \"a third of 8th graders likely could not identify basic literary elements in a text.\"",
      "Literacy experts say that graphic novels can help promote reading comprehension among younger readers, as the combination of pictures and text can keep them engaged with the material. According to a survey conducted by School Library Journal in May 2023, out of the respondents, 90% of public librarians and 83% of school librarians say they suggested graphic novels to students who struggle with reading.",
      "But there is the persisting belief that graphic novels don\u2019t count as \"real reading,\" and 59% of the school librarians surveyed said they've received opposition to graphic novels from teachers, parents and more.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s this idea that if I can read a classic piece of literature, that I\u2019m smart. Whereas, if I read 1,000 chapters of \u2018One Piece\u2019 and I understand the themes and what\u2019s being communicated, that that\u2019s low brow, and that\u2019s not as important,\u201d Weaver says.",
      "\u201cThe data is very clear about what graphic novels do to positively benefit literacy and get kids reading, and I think it\u2019s a no-brainer why graphic novels are a great way to get kids excited about literacy and about storytelling,\" he adds.",
      "This back to school season, Weaver is raising money to purchase books for underresourced schools across the country. Weaver is hosting the fundraising campaign, titled Nerds for Literacy, on the Weird Enough website. After raising funds, Weaver will purchase a list of books \u2014 selected by donors, literacy education specialists and young readers \u2014 from independent bookstores and distribute them to schools.",
      "\"WHO WOULD WIN IN A FIGHT. EVERY NERD IN THE UNITED STATES OR THE YOUTH LITERACY CRISIS?!\" states the donation page, which so far, has raised $25,000 in 48 hours.",
      "In addition to producing his own graphic novel and running Weird Enough Productions, Weaver also uses social media to discuss hard topics in the nerd community, such as racism, bullying and mental health. However, he takes a unique approach.",
      "\u201cWhen I started creating content online, one of my largest gripes was that it felt like everybody was reading off of a cue card. The information wasn\u2019t being presented in an engaging way, in a particularly intuitive way, or in an easy to understand way,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it was super long winded. This video took 60 seconds, you could\u2019ve explained this to me in 10.\u201d",
      "With that, he decided to challenge himself. And what did he decide to do? Well, rhyme.",
      "He calls himself, \"Dr. Seuss without the racism,\" as the children's author's legacy faced a reckoning in 2021 over the racist imagery in his books. In March of that year, Dr. Seuss Enterprises stopped publishing and licensing six of his children's books and said in a statement they \"portray people in ways that are hurtful and wrong.\"",
      "Weaver says he can\u2019t stop rhyming \u2014 no matter how hard he tries.",
      "\u201cAt the beginning, the idea was supposed to be, I have such mastery over the information that I\u2019m trying to present to you that I can do it in a whimsical and rhyme scheme type way, and you still understand exactly what\u2019s going on. That was my goal,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cUltimately, it reached a point where I actually can\u2019t stop rhyming,\" he adds. \"I write stuff and my brain immediately is like, \u2018Cool, so we\u2019ll rhyme it like this,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, no one said this had to rhyme. What are you doing?\u201d",
      "And yes, he did try pausing this approach as an experiment. Let\u2019s just say, people were not supportive.",
      "\u201cWe stopped rhyming for a couple of videos, and the people were like, \u2018Where are the rhymes?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThe people have spoken. They want the bars.\u201d",
      "\u201cWeirdo's\" sequel is currently in the process of being illustrated and will be released in early 2027, he says. The sequel will follow Weaver and his friends (and some new faces!) and connect to the events that occur at the end of the first book.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s intended to grapple with some of these negative feelings that kids have around standardized tests and around the ways that institutions measure intelligence inaccurately,\" he says.",
      "While most of the experiences in \u201cWeirdo\u201d were lifted right from Weaver\u2019s life, he\u2019s having a bit more \"fun\" with its sequel.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a bit more of a divergence between what real life Tony experienced and what\u2019s going on in the world of \u2018Weirdo,\u2019 which lets us play around a lot,\" he says.",
      "Weaver is also trying to find new ways to add more \"updated\" references, but he's admittedly finding it a bit tricky.",
      "\u201cIf you reference it in the last book, are you allowed to reference it this time?\" he poses. \"If you do reference it, do you reference it differently? How do you do it?... Are we talking about Fortnite in \u2018Weirdo 2\u2019? Are there Battle Buses? Are they dropping on Tomato Town? I don\u2019t know!\u201d",
      "While we wait for the sequel, Weaver is keeping his cards close to his chest about what is happening between now and then.",
      "\u201c\u2018Weirdo 2\u2019 is going to be exciting, but you got to keep your eyes peeled. Sequels are always cool things to continue projects, but there are other ways that projects can continue to live on, you know?\u201d he says. \u201cAdaptations are a thing, and that\u2019s all I can really say.\u201d",
      "If you or someone you know is in crisis, call or text 988, or go to 988lifeline.org to reach the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. You can also call the network, previously known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, at 800-273-8255 or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources."

      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \u201cHostage.\u201d",
      "The \u201cHostage\u201d crisis has ended, and so has UK Prime Minister Abigail Dalton\u2019s (Suranne Jones) no-good, terrible, very very bad week.",
      "The Netflix limited series, which stars the \u201cGentleman Jack\u201d actor alongside Oscar nominee Julie Delpy (the \u201cBefore\u201d movie trilogy) as French President Vivienne Toussaint, has been a thrill ride of twists, turns and upending conventions.",
      "The limited series was a breathless roller coaster of a ride for PM Dalton and her family. First her husband Alex (Ashley Thomas), a worker with M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (Doctors without Borders), and his team were taken captive in French Guiana \u2014 just as President Toussaint was in London for a summit to discuss much-needed medicines being sent to the British people.",
      "Vivienne was a challenge to get on board with helping the hostages \u2014 especially after she was blackmailed over her fling with stepson Matheo (Corey Mylchreest). But once Abigail and Vivienne became a team and the hostage crisis ended, it was hard to know what the series would do with the rest of its episodes.",
      "Not to worry: There was still a bombing, political intrigue, Abigail\u2019s being removed from office, a secret investigation with loyalties tested, the demise of Vivienne in a heroic move, and yet another hostage-taking.",
      "So how did it all wrap up? Not quite in a happy, neat bow \u2014 there were casualties of more than one kind in the fifth and final episode. Let\u2019s see who lived, who died, and who will bear the scars.",
      "Do Abigail, Alex and their daughter Sylvie survive on \u2018Hostage\u2019?",
      "Good news: Yes. Bad news: not without some damage.",
      "The episode begins in the immediate aftermath of the 10 Downing Street explosion. The culprit? Saskia\u2019s (Sophie Robertson) conveniently \u201cleft behind\u201d laptop, brought helpfully to the building by Matheo. Angry ex-military man John Shagan (Martin McCann) detonates the laptop.",
      "What does Saskia have to do with this? Turns out Saskia \u2014 posing as Matheo's girlfriend \u2014 was formerly a corporal in the Highland Guards. Her battalion was shut down by Abigail Dalton in an initiative to fund health-related initiatives. John is a retired Highland Guard captain who decided to plan a coup against the prime minister and recruited the likes of Saskia to carry it out (more on that later).",
      "In the blast, Vivienne perishes while alerting the room to the peril.",
      "Alex races in to help his wife, pulling her from the rubble. The Daltons (along with teen daughter Sylvie, played by Isobel Akuwudike) embrace and phew, that might seem to be the end of it. Dalton has been voted out of office by her ministers in a no-confidence vote, and now perhaps she\u2019ll be able to rest easy and leave politics behind.",
      "Er, no. There\u2019s still much of the episode to go! So with John and Saskia on the loose, Dalton sends her family to a safe house Matheo recommends, and all three (plus security) head out to the countryside and a beautiful mansion to rest and recover.",
      "Who dies at the safe house?",
      "Almost immediately, Saskia and John figure out where they believe the Daltons have holed up. Saskia pins down Matheo and Sylvie with a gun, while John scuffles with Alex, slashing his stomach with a knife. John forces the disabled Alex to call Abigail and get her to the house \u2014 without backup.",
      "Abigail arrives downstairs as Matheo, upstairs, dials the equivalent of a 999 call in secret. When Saskia finds out what he\u2019s doing, they struggle and she loses her weapon. He lets her escape (well, they were once lovers) while Sylvie picks up Saskia\u2019s discarded gun.",
      "The teenager goes to find her parents, hearing them in a heated moment with John. Trembling, she turns the gun on John. But her parents urge her not to fire \u2014 they seem to be well aware that if she kills John, she\u2019ll have to live with it for the rest of her life. John, clearly knowing this is his endgame, lets Sylvie know he\u2019s responsible for her beloved grandfather\u2019s murder and \u2014 blam. John goes down. Sylvie, it seems, is a very good shot.",
      "Who\u2019s behind John\u2019s plot, and why was he so focused on Abigail?",
      "We\u2019ve been getting bits of information about John throughout the series. Early on, he tells Alex that he once had a daughter himself.",
      "As we learn, an invasion years ago by Guatemala into Belize (a former Crown colony, now independent) led to Abigail (then a governmental minister) to make a heartbreaking choice between getting British citizens and troops out of the country, or saving locals.",
      "(The invasion is fictional, but the story echoes recent American policy during the Afghanistan evacuation.)",
      "But John had been in love with one of those locals left behind \u2014 and she was pregnant when the invaders shot her.",
      "He wasn\u2019t alone in being furious with Abigail, though.",
      "In yet another betrayal, John is linked to General Livingston (Mark Lewis Jones), who\u2019s got his own bone to pick with the PM over her military spending cuts. He never wanted her dead, just \u201cout of the way,\u201d but John had his own plans.",
      "Abigail and her team figure out that Livingston and John served together, and after some ranting and raving in the war room he\u2019s set up, the general is arrested and marched out.",
      "Does Abigail retire from politics in the end?",
      "In the final scenes, the Daltons are gathered at 10 Downing Street as Abigail prepares for a press briefing outside. Sylvie looks chastened, cuddling a cat. They all agree with Abigail\u2019s plan, whatever it is \u2014 and she pauses on her way out to gaze at a portrait of the late Vivienne.",
      "Outside, we learn that Abigail is now back in power. Her speech underscores that she plans to be truthful and honest with the press and the public going forward.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the least you deserve,\u201d she says."

      "The robotic participants came in all shapes, sizes and structures and competed in 26 different sports events, from running to kickboxing to soccer. The unusual state-backed sports tournament at the National Speed Skating Oval, a Beijing Olympic venue, came as the United States and China race each other to shape the future of AI.",

      "The film, inspired by Chinese mythology, opened in more than 2,500 American theaters on Friday. It is the latest in a wave of successful animations featuring Asian culture, such as Netflix\u2019s recent hit \u201cKPop Demon Hunters.\u201d",
      "The sequel to a hit movie released in 2019, \u201cNe Zha II\u201d tells the story of a child demigod named Ne Zha who rebels against his innate devilry and chooses to use his magical powers and martial arts skills to defend humanity from dragons and other foes.",
      "Yeoh, a Malaysian actor and fluent Mandarin speaker, said she found it hard to follow the English subtitles during some of its more spectacular scenes when she first watched the movie in Hong Kong. She left the theater thinking it needed to be dubbed in English.",

      "Although the English-dubbed version may do better in the U.S. than the earlier Chinese-only release with English subtitles, which earned about $20 million, Zeng said that if \u201cNe Zha II\u201d succeeds with international viewers it is likely to stem more from its domestic acclaim and novelty than from genuine interest in Chinese mythology.",
      "Zeng said while she expects some reviews in the U.S. will criticize the film as Chinese propaganda, other viewers may just watch it out of curiosity.",
      "Kevin Ma, a veteran observer of the film industry who is based in Hong Kong, said another challenge \u201cNe Zha II\u201d faces in its latest release is the tight theatrical window in today\u2019s streaming-dominated market.",
      "New films may capture public attention for only one or two months before moving to streaming platforms, said Ma, who is also a film festival consultant.",
      "Even though \u201cNe Zha II\u201d came out only at the beginning of this year, it almost seems \u201clike a distant memory now\u201d because of consumers\u2019 \u201cshorter attention span\u201d in the streaming age, he said."

    "story": [
      "Famine was officially declared on Friday in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City, by the world's leading authority on hunger as Israel vowed to raze the area if Hamas doesn't agree to its terms.",
      "The declaration of famine by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, or IPC, comes as deaths from starvation rise across the Palestinian enclave in a spiraling crisis under Israel's military assault and aid restrictions.",
      "Israel's military is preparing to push ahead with a new operation to seize Gaza City that could displace hundreds of thousands of people and worsen the dire situation there. It has launched intense strikes on the city this week after announcing it had begun the first stage of its planned assault.",
      "Famine declared",
      "The IPC, an internationally recognized system for classifying food insecurity and malnutrition, said in its report that famine had been confirmed in the Gaza Governorate \u2014 and that it was projected to expand to the Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis Governorates farther south by the end of September if the humanitarian situation does not change.",
      "The number of people now experiencing famine in Gaza was nearly 514,000, the IPC said \u2014 around a quarter of the enclave's population. That was projected to rise to 641,000 by the end of September.",
      "\"Famine is a race against time,\" the IPC said. \"An immediate ceasefire and end to the conflict is critical to enabling an unimpeded, large-scale humanitarian response to save lives.\"",
      "The United Nations-backed body had up until now only declared famine on four other occasions since it was first established in 2004, most recently in Sudan last year.",
      "The report's findings were met with little surprise by global health authorities and humanitarian groups.",
      "\u201cFamine warnings have been clear for months,\u201d said Cindy McCain, executive director of the World Food Program.",
      "\u201cA ceasefire is an absolute and moral imperative now,\u201d said World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. \u201cThe world has waited too long, watching tragic and unnecessary deaths mount from this man-made famine.\"",
      "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu forcefully rejected the report's findings, calling them a \"lie,\" and repeated that \"Israel does not have a policy of starvation.\"",
      "The IPC's 59-page report does not state that Israel has a policy of starvation in Gaza.",
      "Earlier, Israel's foreign ministry said the IPC had published a \u201cfabricated report to fit Hamas\u2019s fake campaign.\u201d It hit out at the IPC\u2019s methods, accusing it of having \u201ctwisted its own rules and ignored its own criteria.\u201d",
      "The IPC rejected Israel\u2019s accusation.",
      "Mike Huckabee, the United States' ambassador to Israel, attacked the famine declaration before it was officially announced.",
      "\"You know who IS starving? The hostages kidnapped and tortured by uncivilized Hamas savages,\" he said in a post on X early Friday.",
      "Famine, the highest phase of the IPC Acute Food Insecurity scale, is classified when an area has at least 20% of households facing an extreme lack of food; at least 30% of children suffering from acute malnutrition and at least two people or four children out of every 10,000 people are dying each day from starvation.",
      "But the bar can also be met if 15% of children are considered to be suffering from acute malnutrition based on mid-upper arm circumference with evidence of rapidly worsening underlying drivers, according to the IPC, which cited the latter practice in its report.",
      "The IPC said that this did not mean it had altered its threshold for famine, saying it used this method in line with established standards where a lack of other data is available, as it had also done in South Sudan.",
      "This \"does not represent a 'lowered threshold' in IPC methodology. Instead, it demonstrates the continued application of established IPC standards,\" it said.",
      "Israel has repeatedly denied reports of growing starvation in Gaza, while seeking to blame any hunger in the enclave on humanitarian groups and Hamas.",
      "The hunger crisis in Gaza intensified after Israel launched a blockade on March 2, in the middle of its ceasefire with Hamas, barring the entry of food and other vital supplies for more than two months. It lifted the blockade in May, but only allowed a basic amount of aid in for weeks after that.",
      "Data published by COGAT states that in the weeks since Israel lifted its blockade on May 19 to August 17, when the database was last updated, 9,165 trucks carrying aid entered the enclave, with food making up just over 95% of the supplies.",
      "That boils down to an average of around 100 trucks carrying aid per day during that time period. Prior to Israel\u2019s offensive in Gaza, around 500 trucks per day were entering the enclave, according to humanitarian groups.",
      "Israel threatens 'gates of hell'",
      "Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz vowed Friday to open the \u201cgates of hell\u201d on Gaza City until Hamas agreed to Israel\u2019s conditions for ending the war, including the release of all hostages and the militant group's complete disarmament.",
      "If not, he said, the city would \u201cbecome like Rafah and Beit Hanoun,\u201d areas that have been largely reduced to ruins under Israel\u2019s 22-month offensive.",
      "Netanyahu said a day earlier that he had authorized the operation to take over Gaza City, while also revealing he had instructed \u201cimmediate negotiations\u201d to begin for a deal to end the war in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages who remain held in the enclave.",
      "The video statement followed days of silence after Hamas announced it had accepted a ceasefire proposal put forward by Arab mediators.",
      "The IPC\u2019s declaration comes just over three weeks after it warned that the \u201cworst-case scenario of famine\u201d was already unfolding in the Palestinian enclave under Israel\u2019s offensive and crippling aid restrictions \u2014 but it had emphasized the alert was not a formal famine classification.",
      "Aid groups have repeatedly warned in recent weeks there is still not enough food entering Gaza to stave off famine.",
      "The Palestinian health ministry in Gaza said on Monday it had recorded three new adult deaths \u201cdue to famine and malnutrition\u201d within a 24-hour period, bringing the total death toll from starvation to 266 people, including 112 children.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage, according to Israeli tallies, marking a major escalation in a decades-long conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the local Palestinian health ministry, with much of the territory destroyed.",
      "Among the dead are hundreds of people who have been killed while trying to seek aid following the introduction of a new distribution system led by Israel and the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation."

      "\u201cThe victory won by the brave soldiers who participated in the war is a great feat that firmly defended the great honor of the KPA,\u201d Kim was quoted as saying, referring to his military, the Korean People\u2019s Army.",
      "Photos released by state media showed Kim pinning commendation badges on soldiers\u2019 uniforms as well as on photo frames of deceased soldiers hung on a wall. They also showed him meeting with and embracing tearful family members of deceased soldiers.",
      "KCNA said Kim laid a flower on a memorial wall and paid a silent tribute at the ceremony, during which the national anthem was also played.",
      "The ceremony on Thursday came a week after Kim received a letter from Russian President Vladimir Putin that also described the North Korean troops as \u201cheroic.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bonds of militant friendship, goodwill and mutual aid which were consolidated in the days of the war long ago remain solid and reliable even today,\u201d Putin said in the letter published by North Korean state media Voice of Korea.",
      "Pyongyang and Moscow have forged increasingly close ties after the Kremlin found itself diplomatically isolated following its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Kim and Putin signed a mutual defense pact last year, and experts say North Korea may have sent Russia troops in exchange for advanced military technology that would aid its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Neither Russia nor North Korea confirmed the deployments until months after Pyongyang sent its first soldiers last fall. Though the two countries have not revealed the exact number of troops involved, it could be as high as 15,000, according to South Korean, U.S. and Ukrainian officials.",
      "Of those, about 600 are believed to have been killed, South Korea\u2019s spy agency said, and thousands more injured.",
      "Though North Korea has one of the largest militaries in the world, its troops have had little real-world combat experience since the end of the Korean War in 1953. But they are strongly loyal to Kim and are trained to take their own lives rather than surrender, former North Korean soldiers who defected have told NBC News.",
      "According to South Korean intelligence, there was at least one incident in which a North Korean soldier seeking to avoid capture by Ukrainian forces was killed while trying to detonate a grenade and shouting Kim\u2019s name.",
      "It is unclear how many North Korean troops remain on the frontlines. South Korean lawmakers said after an intelligence briefing in June that North Korea could deploy additional troops to Russia in July or August and that it was continuing to supply Moscow with arms."

      "The Sinpung-dong Missile Operating Base is about 17 miles from the border with China in the North Korean province of North Pyongan, researchers from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank in Washington, said in a report Wednesday.",
      "The base could contain six to nine of North Korea\u2019s advanced intercontinental ballistic missiles, along with their mobile launchers and thousands of soldiers, the report said. Though the weapons are not likely to be mounted with nuclear warheads, they are capable of carrying them.",
      "\u201cThese missiles pose a potential nuclear threat to East Asia and the continental United States,\u201d the report said.",
      "The site, which the report said North Korea has never referred to publicly, was only recently discovered despite a strict international regime intended to limit further development of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.",
      "Researchers said the report was based on interviews with defectors and officials around the world, as well as declassified documents, satellite images and open-source information.",
      "The report said the weapons at the base could include North Korea\u2019s nuclear-capable Hwasong-15 or Hwasong-18 ICBMs or a missile that has yet to be revealed.",
      "\u201cCurrent assessments are that during times of crisis or war, these launchers and missiles will exit the base, meet special warhead storage/transportation units, and conduct launch operations from dispersed pre-surveyed sites.\u201d",
      "According to the latest estimate from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea has assembled about 50 nuclear warheads and has enough fissile material to produce up to 40 more.",
      "Construction of the Sinpung-dong base began around 2004, and it was \u201cgenerally complete and operational\u201d by 2014, the report said. Satellite images suggest the base continues to be developed and \u201cis active and being well-maintained by North Korean standards,\u201d it said.",

      "Since denuclearization talks between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un broke down in 2019, North Korea has been steadily advancing its weapons programs in defiance of international sanctions.",
      "It has also strengthened security ties with Russia, including sending arms and troops to fight in its war against Ukraine in exchange for support that experts say could include technological assistance with its weapons programs.",
      "Experts say North Korea is likely to be even more determined to pursue nuclear deterrence after U.S. strikes against three Iranian nuclear facilities in June.",

      "LONDON \u2014 The Kremlin signaled Wednesday it was in no rush to agree to a leaders\u2019 summit with Ukraine and warned the West that talks over security guarantees for Kyiv were a \u201croad to nowhere\u201d without its involvement.",
      "Moscow\u2019s latest intervention came as the White House pressed ahead with arrangements for a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, while U.S. and NATO officials discussed how to ensure Ukraine\u2019s protection as part of an eventual peace deal with Russia.",
      "The White House was actively looking to secure a meeting location and date, a senior administration official said Tuesday, adding that the Hungarian capital, Budapest, and the Swiss city of Geneva were among the sites discussed.",
      "But the Kremlin appeared in no hurry for the pair to sit down together.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Putin had suggested continuing negotiations in his call with President Donald Trump on Monday and that Russia was ready to consider \u201craising the level of the heads of delegations.\u201d",
      "But when it comes to meetings at the \u201chighest level,\u201d he said, \u201cthey must be prepared with the utmost care.\u201d",
      "A White House official said in a statement shared with NBC News on Wednesday that they were still working to arrange a bilateral meeting.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump and his national security team continue to engage with Russian and Ukrainian officials towards a bilateral meeting to stop the killing and end the war,\u201d the official said.",
      "\u201cAs many world leaders have stated, this war would have never happened if President Trump was in office. It is not in the national interest to further negotiate these issues publicly.\u201d",
      "Sergii Leshchenko, an adviser to Zelenskyy\u2019s chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, told NBC News on Wednesday that talks can yield results only if Putin and Zelenskyy meet directly.",
      "\u201cWe need a person who is able to make the final decision. Lavrov is not that person. He was not responsible for starting this war. This war was started by Putin personally,\u201d Leshchenko said.",
      "He added, \u201cZelenskyy wants to have direct negotiations with the one person who is able to make a decision and who is responsible for Russia\u2019s side of the war. That is not Lavrov or anyone else. The only person is Putin.\u201d",
      "Moscow also poured cold water on Western efforts to negotiate security guarantees for Ukraine as part of a peace deal with Russia.",
      "Trump promised during a meeting with European leaders in Washington on Monday that the U.S. would provide security guarantees as part of any settlement with Russia \u2014 a red-line issue for Kyiv.

      "Military chiefs from NATO\u2019s 32 member countries will meet virtually later Wednesday to discuss the way forward. U.S. Air Force Gen. Alexus Grynkewich, the head of U.S. European Command and NATO supreme Allied commander for Europe, will attend, the chair of NATO\u2019s military committee said. Their meeting comes after Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, hosted several European chiefs of defense Tuesday evening, a defense official told NBC News.",
      "Lavrov said that Moscow was in favor of \u201ctruly reliable\u201d security guarantees for Ukraine but that any attempt to resolve the question of Ukraine\u2019s security without Russia was \u201ca utopia, a road to nowhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe cannot agree with the idea that now it is proposed to resolve questions of security, collective security, without the Russian Federation,\u201d Lavrov said. \u201cThat will not work.\u201d",
      "Lavrov suggested security guarantees could be modeled on a draft accord Russia and Ukraine discussed in Istanbul in 2022, during the early weeks of the Kremlin\u2019s war. Ukraine rejected the proposal, arguing it would have given Moscow veto power over any military response to come to its aid.",

      "TEL AVIV \u2014 Israel entered the first stages of a planned assault on Gaza City on Wednesday after approving a plan to take it over that includes calling up 60,000 reservists for an expanded military operation in the besieged Palestinian enclave.",
      "\"We have begun the preliminary actions and the initial stages of the offensive on Gaza City, and already now IDF forces are holding positions on the outskirts of Gaza City,\" Israeli military spokesman Effie Defrin told reporters Wednesday.",
      "He added: \"We will intensify the strikes on Hamas in Gaza City, the political and military stronghold of the terror organization.\"",
      "Defrin also said that to \"minimize harm to civilians,\" the IDF will be warning citizens to allow them to evacuate.",
      "\"We are continuing to allow humanitarian aid for the residents of the Strip and are even expanding it \u2014 with additional central aid distribution points,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. ally appeared to be pushing ahead Wednesday with a new phase of its war despite international opposition \u2014 and in the face of a renewed push for a ceasefire with Hamas.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz has authorized the plans for the major new operation, a spokesperson for the ministry confirmed to NBC News. It will also see an additional 20,000 reservists have their service extended, the Israeli military said.",
      "The assault is expected to force thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza to the south of the strip, which is suffering an intensifying hunger crisis under Israel\u2019s military offensive and aid restrictions.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, the prime minister's office said that \"ahead of approval of the plans for the operation in Gaza City, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has directed that the timetables \u2014 for seizing control of the last terrorist strongholds and the defeat of Hamas \u2014 be shortened.\"",
      "\"The Prime Minister expresses his great appreciation for the reservist fighters who have been mobilized and their families, and all IDF soldiers,\" the statement added. \"Together we will win.\"",
      "Hamas criticized the Israeli military's announcement and said in a statement that the Israeli government \"insists on continuing its brutal war against innocent civilians, escalating its criminal operations in Gaza City with the aim of destroying it, and displacing its residents in a full-fledged war crime.\"",
      "The United Nations also denounced the military operations Wednesday. \"Israel\u2019s reported decision to take full control of Gaza City and to forcibly displace its population will lead to mass killings of civilians and destruction of infrastructure vital to the survival of the population,\" the U.N. human rights office for the Palestinian territories said in a statement.",
      "President Donald Trump supports Israel's efforts to disarm Hamas, U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee told The Associated Press on Wednesday.",
      "\"Israel has to make this decision and has to live with whatever decision they make. But President Trump is fully supportive of making sure that Hamas knows that from the U.S. perspective, they have to disarm, they have to give up and let all the hostages go,\" he said. \"Whether it takes 60 days or 60 minutes, that\u2019s the ultimate end result.\"",
      "Scores of people in Gaza have starved to death in recent weeks, including dozens of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave.",
      "In addition to mounting global outrage, sweeping protests have increasingly dominated Israel's streets, with growing numbers demanding an end to the offensive in the enclave.",
      "Hundreds of thousands staged furious demonstrations last weekend alongside a general strike, fueled in part by fears that the planned Gaza City assault could endanger the lives of remaining hostages.",
      "Israel also gave final approval for a widely contested settlement project in the occupied West Bank that would effectively split the territory in two. Palestinians and rights groups have warned the move could destroy plans for a future Palestinian state.",
      "Huckabee said that recent announcements by European leaders recognizing a Palestinian state would be \"counterproductive.\"",
      "\"If they believe that, unilaterally, calling for a two-state a Palestinian state recognition immediately brings them closer, the sad truth is it\u2019s taking them further away,\" he said.",
      "Ceasefire talks uncertain",
      "Katz, who replaced Yoav Gallant as defense minister last year, was  olding a discussion Tuesday to approve \"strike plans in Gaza\" with the Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Eyal Zamir, and other senior defense officials, the defense ministry had said.",
      "The announcement of the expanded military operation comes after Israel appeared to shrug off news that Hamas had agreed to the latest proposal from Arab mediators for a ceasefire deal in Gaza that would free the remaining hostages.",
      "Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty told NBC News on Tuesday that the deal was based on a proposal by Trump\u2019s Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for a 60-day ceasefire, during which some of the remaining 50 hostages, both alive and dead, would be released with plans to negotiate a lasting ceasefire and the return of the rest.",
      "\u201cThe ball is now in Israel\u2019s court,\u201d Abdelatty said, adding: \u201cWe would like a positive response from them as soon as possible in order to deal with the disastrous situation in Gaza, especially the starvation and the killing of civilians.\u201d",
      "Asked about the development, a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s office referred NBC News to a statement the Israeli leader made Monday suggesting he was determined to push ahead with the plan to assume full control of Gaza City and noting that Hamas appeared to be \u201cunder immense pressure.\u201d",
      "Asked if they could confirm reports that Israel would provide a response to international mediators on the proposal by Friday, the spokesperson said \u201cno\u201d and did not provide further clarification.",
      "'There is no safe place'",
      "New satellite imagery suggests that a number of people have already begun to flee the area of Gaza City in recent days ahead of Israel\u2019s advance, with the country\u2019s plan to push civilians living in the area into the enclave\u2019s south condemned by rights groups.",
      "Imagery captured on Aug. 16 shows that sites just south of Gaza City are seemingly barren, having been packed with what appear to be tent camps just days before, on Aug. 9.",
      "Mohammed Abu Sharia, a father of three, said he and his family had been forced to leave their home in Gaza City again \u2014 just months after returning from another round of displacement due to Israel\u2019s offensive.",
      "\u201cThank God, we found our house almost intact and habitable, despite the theft of all its contents and the lack of doors or windows,\u201d Abu Sharia, 48, who ran an internet distribution company before Israel\u2019s assault began, told NBC News on Wednesday.",
      "The family was able to live in their home for the past six months \u2014 but with Israel planning to take over Gaza City, they were now seeking some semblance of refuge in western Gaza.",
      "\u201cThere is no safe place, neither in the north nor the south,\u201d Abu Sharia said. \u201cMy concern is to save the family\u2019s life, as we are suffering from food shortages and the lack of any belongings with us.\u201d",
      "\u201cFurther displacement and an intensification in hostilities risk worsening an already catastrophic situation,\u201d the International Committee of the Red Cross said in a statement.",
      "\u201cWith more than 80 percent of Gaza already impacted by evacuation orders, it is unimaginable that civilians could be compelled to move to an even smaller area,\u201d it said.",
      "Israel launched its offensive in Gaza following the Hamas-led attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and around 250 were taken hostage, marking a major escalation in a decadeslong conflict.",
      "Since then, more than 62,000 people have been killed in Gaza, including thousands of children, according to the Palestinian health ministry in the enclave, with much of the territory destroyed."
